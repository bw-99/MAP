After we have the welltrained Bernoulli gates, we select dimensions across all samples to retrain one recommender model instead of separating samples into different clusters for retraining cluster-customized recommender models; (iii) iHAS-3: This variant is the standard iHAS without using the polarization regularizer described in Section 3. initialized vector of the dimension length, making every sample share the same probability for every dimension.\nBased on the results in Table 4, we can find: (i) iHAS and its variants can increase the AUC and decrease the Logloss compared with the Base model, which indicates the necessity of performing selection on embedding dimensions for boosting model performance; (ii) iHAS performs better than iHAS-1, which indicates the necessity of the subsequent clustering and retraining stages; (iii) iHAS-1 outperforms iHAS-2, therefore, separating instances into different groups, i.e., the clustering stage, is beneficial for boosting the performance; (iv) Polarization is vital for acquiring better Bernoulli gates by comparing iHAS with iHAS-3; (v) Respecting the difference between instances can further boost the performance by comparing iHAS with iHAS-4. </p><h2>publication_ref</h2> <p>[] </p><h2>figure_ref</h2> <p>[] </p><h2>table_ref</h2> <p>['tab_5', 'tab_5'] </p><h2>heading</h2> <p>Efficiency Analysis (RQ4) </p><h2>text</h2> <p>In addition to model performance, efficiency is vital when deploying the recommendation model into online systems, especially inference efficiency.
