These recommendations can be useful for items that are typically consumed more than once (e.g., listening to songs or buying groceries).\n• Hybrid recommendations (HybridRecommender) aggregates the recommendations of several algorithms (Çano and Morisio 2017).\nWe will discuss some of these algorithms in the rest of the paper. Detailed information can be found in the survey book by Desrosiers and Karypis (2011).\nThis rest of this paper is structured as follows. Section 2 introduces collaborative filtering and some of its popular algorithms. In section 3 we discuss the evaluation of recommender algorithms. We introduce the infrastructure provided by recommenderlab in section 4. In section 5 we illustrate the capabilities on the package to create and evaluate recommender algorithms. We conclude with section 6.<h2>publication_ref</h2>['b36', 'b29', 'b38', 'b5', 'b3', 'b1', 'b28', 'b12', 'b37', 'b7', 'b12', 'b34', 'b39', 'b20', 'b37', 'b27', 'b7', 'b18', 'b23', 'b10', 'b31', 'b11', 'b26', 'b6', 'b4', 'b8']<h2>figure_ref</h2>[]<h2>table_ref</h2>[]<h2>heading</h2>Collaborative Filtering<h2>text</h2>To understand the use of the software, a few formal definitions are necessary. We will often give examples for a movie recommender, but the examples generalize to other types of items as well. Let U = {u 1 , u 2 , . . . , u m } be the set of users and I = {i 1 , i 2 , . . . , i n } the set of items.\nRatings are stored in a m × n user-item rating matrix R = (r jk ), where r jk represents the rating of user u j for item i k . Typically, only a small fraction of ratings are known and for many cells in R, the values are missing. Missing values represent movies that the user has not rated and potentially also not seen yet.\nCollaborative filtering aims to create recommendations for a user called the active user u a ∈ U.\nWe define the set of items unknown to user u a as I a = I \\ {i l ∈ I|r al is not missing}. The two typical tasks are to predict ratings for all items in I a or to create a list containing the best N recommended items from I a (i.e., a top-N recommendation list) for u a . Predicting all missing ratings means completing the row of the rating matrix where the missing values for items in I a are replaced by ratings estimated from other data in R. From this point of view, recommender systems are related to matrix completion problem. Creating a top-N list can be seen as a second step after predicting ratings for all unknown items in I a and then taking the N items with the highest predicted ratings. Some algorithms skip predicting ratings first and are able to find the top N items directly. A list of top-N recommendations for a user u a is an partially ordered set T N = (X , ≥), where X ⊂ I a and |X | ≤ N (| • | denotes the cardinality of the set). Note that there may exist cases where top-N lists contain less than N items. This can happen if |I a | < N or if the CF algorithm is unable to identify N items to recommend. The binary relation ≥ is defined as x ≥ y if and only if rax ≥ ray for all x, y ∈ X . Furthermore we require that ∀ x∈X ∀ y∈Ia rax ≥ ray to ensure that the top-N list contains only the items with the highest estimated rating.\nTypically we deal with a very large number of items with unknown ratings which makes first predicting rating values for all of them computationally expensive. Some approaches (e.g., rule based approaches) can predict the top-N list directly without considering all unknown items first.\nCollaborative filtering algorithms are typically divided into two groups, memory-based CF and model-based CF algorithms (Breese, Heckerman, and Kadie 1998). Memory-based CF use the whole (or at least a large sample of the) user database to create recommendations. The most prominent algorithm is user-based collaborative filtering. The disadvantages of this approach is scalability since the whole user database has to be processed online for creating recommendations. Model-based algorithms use the user database to learn a more compact model (e.g, clusters with users of similar preferences) that is later used to create recommendations.\nIn the following we will present the basics of well known memory and model-based collaborative filtering algorithms. Further information about these algorithms can be found in the recent survey book chapter by Desrosiers and Karypis (2011).<h2>publication_ref</h2>['b2', 'b8']<h2>figure_ref</h2>[]<h2>table_ref</h2>[]<h2>heading</h2>User-based Collaborative Filtering<h2>text</h2>User-based CF (Goldberg et al. 1992;Resnick et al. 1994;Shardanand and Maes 1995) is a memory-based algorithm which tries to mimics word-of-mouth by analyzing rating data from many individuals. The assumption is that users with similar preferences will rate items similarly.
