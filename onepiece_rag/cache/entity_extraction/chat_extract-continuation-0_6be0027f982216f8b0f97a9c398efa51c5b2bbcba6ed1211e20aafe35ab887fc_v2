The code is publicly available on https://github.com/YaoYao1995/i-Razor.git.\n6. Dims and Params are roughly calculated by\nN i=1 d f i and N i=1 |f i | × d f i , respectively.<h2>publication_ref</h2>['b51', 'b52', 'b18']<h2>figure_ref</h2>[]<h2>table_ref</h2>['tab_4']<h2>heading</h2>Overall Performance (RQ1)<h2>text</h2>Performance improvement can be an arduous process in real-world recommender systems, so we present the best performance configuration corresponding to each baseline in Table 3 and Table 4. There are several observations:\n• Proper feature selection leads to competitive or even superior performance compared with FDE. This indicates that filtering out less informative and predictive features is beneficial for recommendation models. Additionally, we observe that the discarded fields have a small cardinality (i.e., a small number of features per field) on Avazu, which limits the savings in Params. This emphasizes the importance of further exploring dimension search techniques. • Comparing all dimension search methods with FDE, we observe that dimension search methods generally achieve more significant parameter savings. However, on Criteo, existing dimension search methods assign dimensions to each field, which fails to eliminate the Feature selection eliminates less informative features without compromising model performance, while dimension search effectively reduces parameter quantities. The findings emphasize the importance of integrating these optimization processes, as evidenced by the superior performance of i-Razor compared to other methods.<h2>publication_ref</h2>[]<h2>figure_ref</h2>[]<h2>table_ref</h2>['tab_6', 'tab_7']<h2>heading</h2>Ablation Study (RQ2)<h2>text</h2>In i-Razor, the introduced dimension 0 in the search space plays an important role to filter out the useless fields. Meanwhile, the proposed CPT-based pruning algorithm makes it easy and flexible to derive the desired embedding configuration. To further study the role of these two components, we propose and compare the following four variants:\n1) 'i-Razor w/ 0': using the CPT-based pruning algorithm while introducing dimension 0 into the search space; 2) 'i-Razor w/o 0': only using the CPT-based pruning algorithm; 3) 'argmax w/ 0': using the argmax selector while introducing dimension 0 into the search space; 4) 'argmax w/o 0': only using the argmax selector.\nTo be specific, we consider two kinds of candidate dimension sets, i.e., D 1 = {0, 1, 3, 6, 10} and D 2 = {1, 3, 6, 10}.\nThe best results of these variants on Criteo-FG and Avazu-FG are shown in Table 5 and we draw the following conclusions:\n• By comparing variant (1) with ( 2) and comparing variant (3) with ( 4), we observe that the variants with dimension 0 (w/ 0) consistently outperform those without dimension 0 (w/o 0). The reason is that the introduced dimension 0 can increase the distinction between different fields and avoid assigning dimensions to redundant fields. This observation suggests that the introduction of dimension 0 can benefit recommender systems where noisy and redundant fields exist, especially in the face of thousands of fields in large-scale industrial recommender systems. • By comparing variant (1) with (3) and comparing variant\n(2) with ( 4), we observe that the CPT-based pruning algorithm can achieve a performance gain at the expense of preserving more fields and parameters. Recall that the argmax-based pruning algorithm is a special case of the CPT-based pruning algorithm (by setting cpt = 0), we conclude that the CPT-based pruning algorithm is more suitable for real-world recommender systems due to its flexibility to obtain effective coordination between model performance and memory overhead. In summary, both components have their advantages, such as dimension 0 contributes to feature selection and parameter reduction, while the CPT-based pruning algorithm further helps the model to arrive at better input configurations.<h2>publication_ref</h2>[]<h2>figure_ref</h2>[]<h2>table_ref</h2>['tab_8']<h2>heading</h2>Hyperparameter Study (RQ3)<h2>text</h2>There are two main hyperparameters involved in i-Razor: the threshold cpt and the weight coefficient λ of the regularization term L p . To study the impact of cpt, we investigate how i-Razor performs with the change of cpt, while fixing other parameters (τ = 0.05, λ = 0.0001). As shown in Figure 4, larger cpt leads to larger value of Params, which is straightforward as more embedding regions and fields would be retained. It can be seen that when cpt is relatively small (cpt ≤ 0.3), AUC is improved with the increase of Params. However, when cpt ≥ 0.4, the performance of the model will decrease significantly. The potential reason is that with more fields and embedding dimensions preserved, the DNN model may require more data to eliminate the side-effect of redundant parameters. Meanwhile, the experimental results indicate that larger λ usually corresponds to less Params, which reflects the effectiveness of L p in controlling the number of parameters. However, when L p dominates the gradient update of the architecture\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>I-RAZOR<|>ORGANIZATION<|>i-Razor is a recommender system that utilizes dimension search techniques and a CPT-based pruning algorithm to optimize performance and reduce parameters in real-world applications.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>AVAZU<|>GEO<|>Avazu is a dataset used for testing recommender systems, known for its large-scale industrial applications.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CRITEO<|>GEO<|>Criteo is another dataset utilized in the study of recommender systems, often compared with Avazu for performance evaluation.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>TABLE 3<|>EVENT<|>Table 3 presents the best performance configuration corresponding to each baseline in the study of i-Razor.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>TABLE 4<|>EVENT<|>Table 4 provides additional observations and results related to the performance of i-Razor.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>TABLE 5<|>EVENT<|>Table 5 shows the best results of the variants of i-Razor on Criteo-FG and Avazu-FG.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>TABLE 6<|>EVENT<|>Table 6 contains further data and analysis related to the study of hyperparameters in i-Razor.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>TABLE 7<|>EVENT<|>Table 7 presents findings from the ablation study of i-Razor.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>TABLE 8<|>EVENT<|>Table 8 summarizes the hyperparameter study results for i-Razor.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>I-RAZOR<|>AVAZU<|>i-Razor utilizes the Avazu dataset for testing and optimizing its recommender system performance<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>I-RAZOR<|>CRITEO<|>i-Razor utilizes the Criteo dataset for testing and optimizing its recommender system performance<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>TABLE 3<|>I-RAZOR<|>Table 3 presents performance configurations related to the i-Razor recommender system<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>TABLE 4<|>I-RAZOR<|>Table 4 provides additional observations and results related to the performance of i-Razor<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>TABLE 5<|>I-RAZOR<|>Table 5 shows the best results of the variants of i-Razor<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>TABLE 6<|>I-RAZOR<|>Table 6 contains data related to the hyperparameters of i-Razor<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>TABLE 7<|>I-RAZOR<|>Table 7 presents findings from the ablation study of i-Razor<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>TABLE 8<|>I-RAZOR<|>Table 8 summarizes the hyperparameter study results for i-Razor<|>8)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
