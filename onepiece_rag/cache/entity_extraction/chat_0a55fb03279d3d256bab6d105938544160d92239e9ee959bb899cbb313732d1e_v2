For a constrained-deadline task τ k , the schedulability test in Eq. ( 44) is equivalent to the verification of the existence of 0 < t ≤ D k such that\nC k + τi∈hp2(τ k ) C i + τi∈hp1(τ k ) t T i C i ≤ t.(45)\nWe can then create a virtual sporadic task τ k with execution time\nC k = C k + τi∈hp2(τ k ) C i , relative deadline D k = D k , and period T k = D k .\nIt is clear that the schedulability test to verify the schedulability of task τ k under the interference of the higher-priority tasks hp 1 (τ k ) is the same as that of task τ k under the interference of the higher-priority tasks hp(τ k ).\nFor notational brevity, suppose that there are k * -1 tasks in hp 1 (τ k ).\nTheorem 7.

Task τ k in a sporadic task system with implicit deadlines is schedulable by the RM scheduling algorithm if Lemmas 1, 3, 4, or 5 holds by setting C k t k as U k , α = 1, and β = 1.\nThe above result in Corollary 2 leads to the utilization bound 2 -√ 2 (by using Lemma 5 with α = 1 and β = 1) for RM scheduling, which is worse than the existing Liu and Layland bound ln 2 [39].<h2>publication_ref</h2>['b18', 'b39', 'b37', 'b39', 'b37', 'b34', 'b38']<h2>figure_ref</h2>[]<h2>table_ref</h2>[]<h2>heading</h2>Appendix C: Multiprocessor DM/RM Scheduling<h2>text</h2>This part demonstrates how to use the k 2 Q framework for multiprocessor global fixed-priority scheduling. We consider that the system has M identical processors. For global fixedpriority scheduling, there is a global queue and a global scheduler to dispatch jobs. We demonstrate the applicability for constrained-deadline and implicit-deadline sporadic systems under global fixed-priority scheduling. Specifically, we will present how to apply the framework to obtain speed-up and capacity augmentation factors for global DM and global RM.\nThe success of the scheme depends on a corresponding exponential-time test. Here we will use the property to be presented in Lemma 9, based on the forced-forward algorithm proposed by Baruah et al. [7] to characterize the workload of higher-priority tasks. The method in [7] to analyze fixedpriority scheduling is completely different from ours, as they rely on the demand bound functions of the tasks.\nThe following lemma provides a sufficient test based on the observations by Baruah et al. [7]. The construction of the following lemma is based on a minor change of the forcedforward algorithm.\nLemma 9. Let ∆ max k be max k-1 j=1 {U j , C k D k }.\nTask τ k in a sporadic task system with constrained deadlines is schedulable by a global fixed-priority (workload conserving) scheduling algorithm on M processors if\n∀y ≥ 0, (∀0 ≤ ω i ≤ T i , ∀τ i ∈ hp(τ k )) , ∃t with 0 < t ≤ D k + y such that ∆ max k • (D k + y) + k-1 i=1 ω i • U i + t-ωi Ti C i M ≤ t.\nProof: This is proved by contrapositive. If task τ k is not schedulable by the global fixed-priority scheduling, we will show that there exist y ≥ 0 and 0\n≤ ω i ≤ T i such that for all 0 < t ≤ D k + y, the condition ∆ max k • (D k + y) + k-1 i=1 ωi•Ui+ t-ω i T i Ci M > t holds.\nThe proof is mainly based on the forced-forward algorithm for the analysis of global DM by Baruah et al. in [7], by making some further annotations.\nIf τ\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}}
