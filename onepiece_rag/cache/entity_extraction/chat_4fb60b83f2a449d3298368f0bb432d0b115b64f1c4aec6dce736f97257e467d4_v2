A CF algorithm recommends items of interest to the target user by leveraging the votes given by other similar users. In a standard CF framework, it is assumed that the credibility of every voting user is exactly the same with respect to the target user. This assumption is not satisfied and may lead to misleading recommendations in practice. A natural countermeasure is to design a trust-aware CF algorithm, which can take account of the difference in the credibilities of the voting users when performing CF. To this end, this paper presents a trust inference approach, which can predict the implicit trust of the target user on every voting user from a sparse explicit trust matrix. Then an improved CF algorithm termed iTrace is proposed, which employs both the explicit and the predicted implicit trust to provide recommendations. An empirical evaluation on a public dataset demonstrates that the proposed algorithm provides a significant improvement in recommendation quality in terms of mean absolute error.<h1>sections</h1><h2>heading</h2>INTRODUCTION<h2>text</h2>With the massive growth of the internet and the emergence of electronic commerce over the last decades, recommender system (RecSys) has become an indispensable technique to mitigate the problem of information overload for users. The aim of RecSys is to provide target users with high quality, personalized recommendations, and to help them find items ⋆ Correspondence author: Bin Liu (Email: bins@ieee.org).

The underlying idea of CF is that users with similar preferences in the past are likely to favor the same items (e.g., books, movies, news, music, etc.) in the future. The CF method is easy to implement. A typical CF method predicts the rating value user u gives to item i as follows [2]:\nr u,i = ru + v∈U w(u, v)(r v,i -rv ) v∈U |w(u, v)| ,(1)\nwhere U denotes a set of K neighbors of u who rated item i (also called u ′ s voting users in what follows), ru the average rating of user u for all the items rated by u, and w(u, v) the weight assigned to user v ′ s vote when she recommends items to u. In a standard CF framework, the weight w(u, v) is set as a similarity measure between users u and v, denoted by sim(u, v), and the neighbors of u are those most similar to u who co-rated item i with u. In order to compute the similarity between users, a variety of similarity measures have been proposed, such as Pearson correlation, cosine vector similarity, Spearman correlation, entropy-based uncertainty, and meansquare difference. It is reported that Pearson correlation performs better than the others [5,6]. The Pearson correlation coefficient is used here, defined as follows [3,7] sim\n(u, v) = i∈I (r u,i -ru )(r v,i -rv ) i∈I (r u,i -ru ) 2 i∈I (r v,i -rv ) 2 , (2\n) where\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}}
