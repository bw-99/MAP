Recommendation Systems </p><h2>text</h2> <p>RecSys are composed of a filtering and a ranking stage [2]. The filtering stage (Fig. 1(a)) aims to reduce the number of computations needed in the ranking stage by determining a set of candidate items (e.g. O(100)) from the entire item database (e.g. O(10 6 )). The ranking stage (Fig. 1(b)) aims to find the item with the highest score for a specific user from the candidate items. The filtering stage uses a DNN to characterize the user behavior as a single embedding vector. Based on this user behavior, the candidate items to recommend can be found by using the NNS on the item ET as shown in Fig. 1(a). The goal of the ranking stage is to evaluate each user-item pair and predict the score of each candidate item for a specific user. The score is defined as the click-through rate (CTR) and indicates the likelihood that an item will be clicked. Based on the scores, the top-k items (O (10)) are returned to the user (Fig. 1(b)).\nBoth DNN models in the filtering and ranking stages follow the configuration depicted in Fig. 1(c). DNNs are employed to generate the embedding vector representing the user behavior or predicting user-item pair scores. The models take advantage of both continuous (dense) and categorical (sparse) features.\nDense features can be directly processed by a DNN while sparse features are captured by large ETs with sparse lookup and pooling operations. These ET operations (lookups, NNS) contribute a significant portion of the run time in RecSys as shown in the operation breakdown of the MovieLens dataset using the YouTubeDNN RecSys [2] in Fig. 2.\nExisting efforts on accelerating RecSys include field programmable gate array (FPGA)-based accelerators. E.g., Flee-tRec [12] and MicroRec [13] alleviate the memory-bandwidth bottleneck of the ETs in RecSys by using FPGAs with high bandwidth memory. Near-memory computing has also been considered to alleviate the memory bottleneck. RecNMP [4] uses a dual in-line memory module-based near-memory computing that can support sparse embedding models. Most of these existing hardware accelerators only focus on a single aspect of RecSys, i.e., ranking, filtering, DNNs or ETs. Though it is possible to simply cascade these accelerators to implement RecSys, such a simple-minded approach results in higher hardware cost due to duplicated components. </p><h2>publication_ref</h2> <p>['b1', 'b9', 'b1', 'b11', 'b12', 'b3'] </p><h2>figure_ref</h2> <p>['fig_0', 'fig_0', 'fig_0', 'fig_0', 'fig_0', 'fig_1'] </p><h2>table_ref</h2> <p>[] </p><h2>heading</h2> <p>B. In-Memory Computing Circuits </p><h2>text</h2> <p>IMC circuits can alleviate the memory bottleneck and provide parallelism to RecSys operations. This section discusses different types of IMC circuits such as TCAMs, crossbars, GPCiMs and CMA.\nTCAMs enable parallel searches based on the Hamming distance for a query against a large stored database in O(1) time [5]. Using the threshold-match mode of the TCAMs, we can retrieve the row entries in the array nearest to the query under the threshold distance by parallel searches. In a TCAM array with r rows and c columns, the TCAM cells in a row are serially connected through a common matchline. Each TCAM cell, s ij , performs an XOR operation between bit j of query Q and the bit j stored at s ij . Each matchline implements a logic AND of all the cells connected to it.\nCrossbars are an IMC structure where every input is connected to every output through cross-points that consist of memory elements and selectors. Crossbars can efficiently implement matrix-vector multiplications, and are thus ideal accelerators for DNN models such as convolutional neural networks [14].\nGPCiMs [7], [15] perform general-purpose Boolean logic and arithmetic operations inside RAM. GPCiMs can employ specialized memory cells based on emerging technologies to perform current-based operations inside a memory array (e.g., [7]). Alternatively, customized memory peripherals (such as sense amplifiers\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}}
