Similarly, Rybarczyk [33] has shown under some extra conditions (i.e.,\nP n = Œò(n Œæ ) with Œæ > 1) that if p s = ln n+(k-1) ln ln n+Œ±n n , then G(n, K n , P n ) is almost surely k- connected (resp., not k-connected) if lim n‚Üí‚àû Œ± n = +‚àû (resp., lim n‚Üí‚àû Œ± n = -‚àû).\nThe analogy between these two results could be exploited to conjecture similar k-connectivity results for our system model G on . To see this, recall from (3) that\nG on = G(n, K n , P n ) ‚à© G(n, p n ).(21)\nSince G(n, K n , P n ) and G(n, p s ) have similar k-connectivity properties, it would seem intuitive to replace G(n, K n , P n ) with G(n, p s ) in the above equation (21). Then, using we would automatically obtain Theorem 1 via the aforementioned results of Erd≈ës and R√©nyi [12]. Unfortunately, such heuristic approaches can not be taken for granted as G(n, K n , P n ) = G(n, p s ) in general. For instance, the two graphs are shown [38], [40] to exhibit quite different characteristics in terms of properties including clustering coefficient, number of triangles, etc. To this end, Theorem 1 formally validates the above intuition for the k-connectivity property, and it is worth mentioning that we establish Theorem 1 with a direct proof that does not rely on coupling arguments between random key graph and ER graph.\nG on ‚âÉ G(n, p s ) ‚à© G(n, p n ) = G(n, p n p s ) = G(n, p e ),\nWe now compare our results with those of Rybarczyk [33] for the k-connectivity of random key graph G(n, K n , P n ). As already noted, Rybarczyk [33, Remark 1, p. 5] has established an analog of Corollary 2, but under assumptions much stronger than ours. In particular, her result requires that P n = Œò(n Œæ ) where Œæ > 1. In comparison, Corollary 2 established here enforces only that P n ‚â• ‚Ñ¶(n), which is clearly a much weaker condition than P n = Œò(n Œæ ) with Œæ > 1. More importantly, our condition P n ‚â• ‚Ñ¶(n) requires (from (20)) only that K n = ‚Ñ¶( ‚àö ln n) for the one-law to hold; i.e., for G on to be k-connected. However, the condition P n = Œò(n Œæ ) with Œæ > 1 enforced in [33] requires the key ring sizes to satisfy K n = ‚Ñ¶( ‚àö n Œæ-1 ln n) with Œæ -1 > 0. This condition not only constitutes a much stronger requirement than K n = ‚Ñ¶( ‚àö ln n), but it also renders the k-connectivity result given in [33] not applicable in the context of WSNs. This is because K n controls the number of keys kept in each sensor's memory, and should be very small [13] due to limited memory and computational capability of sensor nodes; in general K n = O(ln n) is accepted [9] as a reasonable bound on the key ring sizes.\nFinally, we compare Theorem 1 with the zero-one law given by Yagan [37] for the 1-connectivity of G on . As mentioned in Section II above, he shows that if\np e ‚àº c ln n n = ln n + (c -1) ln n n(22)\nthen G on is a.a.s. connected if c > 1, and it is a.a.s. not connected if c < 1. This was done under the additional \nG o n is k-connected p = 0.2 k = 4 k = 6 k = 8 k = 10\nFig. 2. Empirical probability that Gon(n, K, P, p) is k-connected for k = 4, 6, 8, and 10. We take n = 2000, P = 10, 000 and p = 0.2. Vertical dashed lines stand for the critical threshold of k-connectivity asserted by Theorem 1.\nconditions that P n = ‚Ñ¶(n) (required only for the one-law) and that lim n‚Üí‚àû p n ln n exists (required only for the zerolaw). On the other hand, Theorem 1 given here establishes (by setting k = 1) that, if\np e = ln n + Œ± n n(23)\nthen G on is a.a.s. connected if lim n‚Üí‚àû Œ± n = ‚àû, and it is a.a.s. not connected if lim n‚Üí‚àû Œ± n = -‚àû. This result relies on the extra conditions P n = ‚Ñ¶(n) and Kn Pn = o(1) for the one-law and on\nK 2 n Pn = o(1)\nfor the zero-law. Comparing ( 22) and ( 23), we see that our 1-connectivity result for G on is somewhat more fine-grained than Yagan\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>G(n, p_n)<|>concept<|>G(n, p_n) is a random graph model that describes the connectivity properties of graphs based on the number of nodes n and the probability p_n of edge formation between nodes.)\n(\"entity\"<|>K-CONNECTIVITY<|>concept<|>K-connectivity refers to a property of a graph indicating that there are at least k vertex-disjoint paths between any pair of vertices, ensuring robust connectivity.)\n(\"entity\"<|>RYBARCZYK<|>organization<|>Rybarczyk is a researcher who has contributed to the study of k-connectivity in random graphs, providing results under specific conditions.)\n(\"entity\"<|>THEOREM 1<|>concept<|>Theorem 1 is a formal statement that validates the conditions under which G(n, p_n) is k-connected, based on the behavior of Œ±_n as n approaches infinity.)\n(\"entity\"<|>COROLLARY 2<|>concept<|>Corollary 2 is a result derived from Theorem 1 that establishes weaker conditions for k-connectivity compared to previous results by Rybarczyk.)\n(\"entity\"<|>WSNs<|>concept<|>Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) are networks of spatially distributed autonomous sensors that monitor physical or environmental conditions and require efficient key management for security.)\n(\"entity\"<|>ZERO-ONE LAW<|>concept<|>The zero-one law is a principle in probability theory that states certain events in random graphs will almost surely occur or not occur as the number of nodes approaches infinity.)\n(\"entity\"<|>YAGAN<|>organization<|>Yagan is a researcher who has established results regarding the 1-connectivity of random graphs, contributing to the understanding of connectivity thresholds.)\n(\"relationship\"<|>G(n, p_n)<|>K-CONNECTIVITY<|>G(n, p_n) is analyzed for its k-connectivity properties, determining how robustly connected the graph is based on the parameters n and p_n.<|>8)\n(\"relationship\"<|>RYBARCZYK<|>THEOREM 1<|>Rybarczyk's results provide a foundation for understanding the conditions under which Theorem 1 applies to k-connectivity in random graphs.<|>7)\n(\"relationship\"<|>THEOREM 1<|>COROLLARY 2<|>Corollary 2 is derived from Theorem 1, establishing a weaker condition for k-connectivity compared to Rybarczyk's stronger assumptions.<|>6)\n(\"relationship\"<|>WSNs<|>RYBARCZYK<|>Rybarczyk's findings are particularly relevant to the context of Wireless Sensor Networks, where efficient key management is crucial for connectivity.<|>5)\n(\"relationship\"<|>ZERO-ONE LAW<|>YAGAN<|>Yagan's work on the zero-one law provides insights into the connectivity properties of random graphs, complementing the findings of Theorem 1.<|>6)\n(\"relationship\"<|>G(n, p_n)<|>ZERO-ONE LAW<|>The zero-one law applies to the connectivity of G(n, p_n), indicating whether the graph is almost surely connected or not based on certain parameters.<|>7) \n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
