Generally, previous work [7], [19] defined the dimension candidate set D as a set of positive integers, which implicitly assumes that every field is indispensable to the performance of the model. The assumption holds well under fine-grained feature engineering. However, in industrial recommender systems, features are iterated rapidly to continuously improve the user experience, but not all newly generated features/fields are beneficial. When only given the original field set F rather than a well-chosen subset F ‚äÜ F, allocating dimensions to noisy fields would introduce superfluous memory consumption and lead to suboptimal performance. To avoid forcing dimension assignment to noisy fields, we propose a masking operator corresponding to dimension 0, which helps identify and filter out fields detrimental to the target DNN model. Despite the fact that neural networks can automatically adjust weights related to useless fields, the introduction of dimension 0 makes it easier to learn and observable for us to understand the importance of the field. We can easily obtain the ideal F for the retraining stage by removing the fields in F that are dominated by dimension 0. </p><h2>publication_ref</h2> <p>['b6', 'b18'] </p><h2>figure_ref</h2> <p>[] </p><h2>table_ref</h2> <p>[] </p><h2>heading</h2> <p>Embedding Division </p><h2>text</h2> <p>In this paper, we assign the same search space to all fields for simplicity, and it is straightforward to introduce varying candidate sets. Instead of directly concatenating the K candidate embedding dimensions together, a sharing embedding architecture is introduced in order to reduce storage space and increase training efficiency. As shown in Figure 3, we allocate a d K -dimensional embedding to each field f i , denoted by e i , which is divided into K independent regions. Specifically, the first region covers the front d 1 embedding blocks (corresponding to no dimensional blocks in the case of d 1 = 0) and the j-th (1 < j ‚â§ K) region ranges from the (d j-1 + 1)-th digit to the d j -th digit of e i . To automatically learn the relative importance of each embedding region to the performance of the target DNN model, we assign a corresponding operator O i j ‚àà R d K to the j-th region. The elements in these operators are either 1 or 0, where 1 in a operator reflects control over the embedding block at the corresponding position, while 0 indicates the embedding block at that position is masked so that the operator is independent of that block. By determining whether to keep each region in the retraining stage individually, the dimension search problem can be reformulated as an operator selection problem.\nIn contrast to existing dimension search methods [19], [20], where different operators may share the front dimensions, the proposed decoupled structure is tailored for learning the relative importance of each independent embedding region, allowing for greater flexibility in selecting the appropriate combination of embedding regions based on the importance weights. Notice that by setting D subtly, such as\nd j | d j = j√ó(j-1) 2 , j ‚àà [1, K] or d j | d j = 2 j-1 , j ‚àà [1, K]\n, the actual dimension search space we can get is able to cover all the integers in the interval [d 1 , d K ] when we aim to select some of the embedding regions to determine the final dimension size after pruning unconsidered regions. For example, given D = 0, 1, 3, 6, we can get the dimension size of 5 by selecting the third region with 2 embedding blocks and the fourth region with 3 blocks. In contrast, previous methods can only select an embedding size that belongs to D because the regions controlled by different operators are overlapping, and the importance of these coupled operators is not independent of each other.\nùëí ! \" ùëí # \" e $ \" ùëí % \" ùëí & \" ùëí ' \" ùëí ( \" ùëí ) \" ùëí !
