Formally, cell i is removed if its gene count j 1 {Xij >0} is less than θ g , where X ij denotes the expression level of gene j in cell i, and 1 represents the indicator function.\nGene Filtering Similarly, genes expressed in fewer than θ c cells are discarded. A gene j is eliminated if i 1 {Xij >0} falls below θ c .<h2>publication_ref</h2>[]<h2>figure_ref</h2>[]<h2>table_ref</h2>[]<h2>heading</h2>Normalization and Logarithmic Scaling<h2>text</h2>The gene expression dataset undergoes normalization to equalize expression levels across cells, parameterized by counts per cell after. Postnormalization, logarithmic scaling is applied:\nX ′ ij = log(1 + X ij )\n, where X ij represents the normalized expression of gene j in cell i.\nIdentification of Highly Variable Genes Genes are deemed highly variable based on their mean expression µ j and dispersion σ 2 j , constrained within specified thresholds. A gene j qualifies as highly variable if it meets the criteria θ µ,min < µ j < θ µ,max and σ 2 j > θ σ . Scaling Subsequently, gene expression levels are standardized, ensuring zero mean and unit variance for each gene:\nX ′ ij = Xij -Xj σj\n, where X j and σ j denote the mean and standard deviation of gene j's expression, respectively.\nFinal Steps After the selection of highly variable genes, further scaling is applied:\nX ′′ ij = min(max(X ′ ij , -θ max ), θ max ).\nThis step ensures that the data range remains within the predefined limits, specified by θ max .<h2>publication_ref</h2>[]<h2>figure_ref</h2>[]<h2>table_ref</h2>[]<h2>heading</h2>A.5 PROJECTION TO REDUCED SUBSPACE<h2>text</h2>In downstream analysis, Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is utilized to reduce the dimensionality of a gene expression matrix, X ′′ ∈ R N ×d , comprising N cells and d genes. This process involves the eigendecomposition of the covariance matrix Σ of pre-processed data X ′′ , to compute eigenvectors v i and their corresponding eigenvalues λ i , satisfying the equation Σv i = λ i v i . The top m eigenvectors, selected based on the magnitude of their eigenvalues, are represented as a matrix V m ∈ R d×m . The data X ′′ is then projected onto the lower-dimensional subspace defined by V m , resulting in the projected data X proj = X ′′ V m , where X proj ∈ R N ×m and m ≪ d.\nAlgorithm 2 K-S Test for Each Principal Component of a High-Dimensional Sample against a Gaussian Reference Distribution 1: Null Hypothesis H 0 : The data for principal component i follows the reference distribution f (x).\n2: Significance Level α: Threshold (α = 0.05) to decide on the null hypothesis based on the K-S statistic. 3: for each principal component i in x proj ∈ R N ×m do 4: Extract all data points in dimension i to form S i = {x 1,i proj , x 2,i proj , . . . , x N,i proj }<h2>publication_ref</h2>[]<h2>figure_ref</h2>[]<h2>table_ref</h2>[]<h2>heading</h2>5:<h2>text</h2>Compute mean µ i and variance σ 2 i of S i 6:\nDefine the Gaussian reference distribution f (x) = N (x; µ i , σ 2 i )\n7:\nSort S i in ascending order 8:\nfor j = 1 to N do 9:\nF emp (x j,i proj ) = j N ▷ Empirical Cumulative Distribution Function (ECDF) 10: F ref (x j,i proj ) = x j,i proj -∞ f (x) dx ▷ CDF of the Reference Gaussian Distribution 11: D j,i = |F emp (x j,i proj ) -F ref (x j,i proj )| ▷ K-S Statistic 12:\nend for 13:\nD i = max j D j,i 14:\nif D i is greater than the critical value at significance α for dimension i then end if 19: end for To determine if GMM is appropriate to model the scRNA-seq data, we apply Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) Test to all principal components as detailed in Algorithm 2.
