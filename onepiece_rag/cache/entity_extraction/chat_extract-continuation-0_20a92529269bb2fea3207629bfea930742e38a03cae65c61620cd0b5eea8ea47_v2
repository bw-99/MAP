Thus, we compare held out relevant items to the user's mixture representation we use to query. We measure this \"goodness of fit\" by computing the Earth Mover's Distance (EMD) [19] between a uniform distribution over a user's relevant items and the user's mixture distribution. The EMD measures the distance between two probability distributions over a metric space [17,7]. We measure the distance between a user's cluster distribution (e.g., Equation 3 and Equation 4), to a uniform distribution over a held-out set of relevant items: p(i|u j ) over a Euclidean space. We compute EMD by soft assigning all held-out relevant items of a user to clusters, minimizing the sum of item-cluster distances, with the constraint that the sum over soft assignments matches p(c|u j ). As seen in Figure 2, with standard unimodal representations, a single embedding vector is compared to the held-out items and the goodness of fit is the distance between the item embeddings and the singular user embedding. In comparison, for mixture representations (Figure 2, each user multiple user embeddings who each have fractional probability mass that in total sums to 1. The goodness of fit is then the distance achieved by allocating the mass in each item to the closest user embedding cluster with available probability mass. Observing unimodal representations in Fig. 2, a single unimodal embedding is situated in the embedding space and compared to held-out relevant items.\nAs shown, some held-out items are close to the unimodal embedding, while others are further away. In contrast, for mixture representations, each user has multiple user-embeddings and each of these embeddings lies close to a cluster of relevant items. The intuition is that if a user has multiple item clusters they are interested in, multiple user embeddings can better capture these interests.   </p><h2>publication_ref</h2> <p>['b18', 'b16', 'b6'] </p><h2>figure_ref</h2> <p>['fig_0', 'fig_0', 'fig_0'] </p><h2>table_ref</h2> <p>[] </p><h2>heading</h2> <p>Experiments </p><h2>text</h2> <p>Experimental Setup: For our underlying ANN-based candidate retrieval system, we start by creating a bipartite graph between source entities and target entities for each dataset, with each edge representing explicit relevance between items (e.g., citing paper cites cited paper or user follows content producer). We then learn unimodal 100-dimensional embeddings for users and items by training over 20 epochs and cluster them via spherical k-means over 20 epochs [2].\nEvaluation Task: We evaluate three candidate retrieval strategies -baseline ANN with unimodal embeddings (which is how most ANN-based candidate retrieval systems work), mixture of embeddings with no smoothing [23], and mixture of embeddings with smoothing (i.e., kNN-Embed). For each strategy, we compute the Recall@K, diversity, and fit in a link prediction task. </p><h2>publication_ref</h2> <p>['b1', 'b22'] </p><h2>figure_ref</h2> <p>[] </p><h2>table_ref</h2> <p>[] </p><h2>heading</h2> <p>Research Hypotheses: </p><h2>text</h2> <p>We explore two research hypotheses (as well as achieve some understanding of the hyperparameters): (1) Unimodal embeddings miss many relevant items due to the similarity of retrieved items.

Mixture of embeddings with no smoothing, yields a 14% relative improvement in R@10 for for HEP-TH, and 16% relative improvement for DBLP. Our second hypothesis (2) posits that data sparsity can lead to sub-optimal mixtures of embeddings, and that nearest-neighbor smoothing can mitigate this. Our experiments support this hypothesis, as we see a 25% relative improvement for HEP-TH in R@10, and 35% for DBLP and when using kNN-Embed.
