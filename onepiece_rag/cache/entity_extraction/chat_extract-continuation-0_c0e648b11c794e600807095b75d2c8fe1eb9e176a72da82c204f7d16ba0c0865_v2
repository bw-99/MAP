These candidate items are then ranked and pruned in later stages of recommender systems using a more complex ranking model. As the top of the recommendation funnel, it is important to retrieve a high-recall candidate set to feed into downstream ranking models. A common approach is to leverage approximate nearest neighbor (ANN) search from a single dense query embedding; however, this approach this can yield a low-diversity result set with many near duplicates. As users often have multiple interests, candidate retrieval should ideally return a diverse set of candidates reflective of the user's multiple interests. To this end, we introduce kNN-Embed, a general approach to improving diversity in dense ANN-based retrieval. kNN-Embed represents each user as a smoothed mixture over learned item clusters that represent distinct \"interests\" of the user. By querying each of a user's mixture component in proportion to their mixture weights, we retrieve a high-diversity set of candidates reflecting elements from each of a user's interests. We experimentally compare kNN-Embed to standard ANN candidate retrieval, and show significant improvements in overall recall and improved diversity across three datasets. Accompanying this work, we open source a large Twitter follow-graph dataset1, to spur further research in graph-mining and representation learning for recommender systems. </p><h1>sections</h1><h2>heading</h2> <p>Introduction </p><h2>text</h2> <p>Recommendation systems for online services such as e-commerce or social networks present users with suggestions in the form of ranked lists of items [5]. </p><h2>publication_ref</h2> <p>['b4'] </p><h2>figure_ref</h2> <p>[] </p><h2>table_ref</h2> <p>[] </p><h2>heading</h2> <p>Related Works </p><h2>text</h2> <p>Traditionally, techniques for candidate retrieval rely on fast, scalable approaches to search large collections for similar sparse vectors [3,1]. Approaches apply indexing and optimization strategies to scale sparse similarity search. One such strategy builds a static clustering of the entire collection of items; clusters are retrieved based on how well their centroids match the query [25,20]. These methods either (1) match the query against clusters of items and rank clusters based on similarity to query or (2) utilize clusters as a form of item smoothing.\nFor embedding-based recommender systems [28], large-scale dense similarity search has been applied for retrieval. Some approaches proposed utilize hashing-based techniques such as mapping input and targets to discrete partitions and selecting targets from the same partitions as inputs [26]. With the advent of fast approximate nearest-neighbor search [21,13], dense nearest neighbor has been applied by recommender systems for candidate retrieval [5].\nWhen utilizing graph-based embeddings for recommender systems [8], some methods transform single-mode embeddings to multiple modes by clustering user actions [23]. Our method extends upon this idea by incorporating nearest neighbor smoothing to address the sparsity problem of generating mixtures of embeddings for users with few engagements.\nSmoothing via k-nearest-neighbor search has been applied for better language modeling [16] and machine translation [15]. We smooth low-engagement user representations by leveraging engagements from similar users. </p><h2>publication_ref</h2> <p>['b2', 'b0', 'b24', 'b19', 'b27', 'b25', 'b20', 'b12', 'b4', 'b7', 'b22', 'b15', 'b14'] </p><h2>figure_ref</h2> <p>[] </p><h2>table_ref</h2> <p>[] </p><h2>heading</h2> <p>kNN-Embed </p><h2>text</h2> <p> </p><h2>publication_ref</h2> <p>[] </p><h2>figure_ref</h2> <p>[] </p><h2>table_ref</h2> <p>[] </p><h2>heading</h2> <p>Preliminaries </p><h2>text</h2> <p>Let U = u 1 , u 2 , . . . u n  be the set of source entities (i.e., users in a recommender system) and I = i 1 , i 2 , . . . i m  be the set of target entities (i.e., items in a recommender system). Let G constitute a bipartite graph representing the engagements between users (U) and items (I). For each user and item, we define a \"relevance\" variable in 0, 1 indicating an item's relevance to a particular user. An item is considered relevant to a particular user if a user, presented with an item, will engage with said item. Based on the engagements in G, each user, u j , is associated with a d-dimensional embedding vector u j ∈ R d ; similarly each target item i k is associated with an embedding vector i k ∈ R d . We call these the unimodal embeddings, and assume that they model user-item relevance p(relevance|u j , i k ) = f (u j , i k ) for a suitable function f .\nGiven the input user-item engagement graph, our goal is to learn mixtures of embeddings representations of users that better capture the multiple interests of a user as evidenced by higher recall in a candidate retrieval task. </p><h2>\r\n######################\r\noutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>CANDIDATE RETRIEVAL<|>CONCEPT<|>Candidate retrieval is the initial stage in recommendation systems where a lightweight system retrieves potentially relevant items for a given user, aiming to create a high-recall candidate set for further ranking and pruning in later stages.)\r\n##\r\n(\"entity\"<|>RECOMMENDER SYSTEMS<|>CONCEPT<|>Recommender systems are systems designed to suggest items to users based on their preferences and behaviors, often utilizing complex algorithms to rank and filter items.)\r\n##\r\n(\"entity\"<|>kNN-EMBED<|>CONCEPT<|>kNN-Embed is a proposed method that enhances diversity in candidate retrieval by representing users as a mixture over learned item clusters, reflecting the user's multiple interests.)\r\n##\r\n(\"entity\"<|>APPROXIMATE NEAREST NEIGHBOR (ANN)<|>CONCEPT<|>Approximate nearest neighbor (ANN) search is a technique used to quickly find items that are similar to a given query, often used in recommendation systems to retrieve relevant candidates.)\r\n##\r\n(\"entity\"<|>USER ENGAGEMENT GRAPH<|>CONCEPT<|>The user engagement graph is a bipartite graph that represents the interactions between users and items, indicating which items are relevant to which users based on their engagement.)\r\n##\r\n(\"entity\"<|>UNIMODAL EMBEDDINGS<|>CONCEPT<|>Unimodal embeddings are d-dimensional vectors associated with users and items in a recommender system, modeling the relevance between users and items.)\r\n##\r\n(\"entity\"<|>RELEVANCE VARIABLE<|>CONCEPT<|>The relevance variable is a binary indicator (0 or 1) that signifies whether an item is relevant to a particular user based on their engagement with that item.)\r\n##\r\n(\"relationship\"<|>CANDIDATE RETRIEVAL<|>RECOMMENDER SYSTEMS<|>Candidate retrieval is a crucial first step in recommender systems, as it identifies potentially relevant items for users before further processing.<|>9)\r\n##\r\n(\"relationship\"<|>kNN-EMBED<|>RECOMMENDER SYSTEMS<|>kNN-Embed is a method used within recommender systems to improve the diversity of candidate retrieval by considering multiple user interests.<|>8)\r\n##\r\n(\"relationship\"<|>APPROXIMATE NEAREST NEIGHBOR (ANN)<|>CANDIDATE RETRIEVAL<|>ANN is a common approach used in candidate retrieval to efficiently find relevant items for users based on their preferences.<|>7)\r\n##\r\n(\"relationship\"<|>USER ENGAGEMENT GRAPH<|>RECOMMENDER SYSTEMS<|>The user engagement graph is fundamental to recommender systems as it captures the interactions between users and items, informing the recommendation process.<|>8)\r\n##\r\n(\"relationship\"<|>UNIMODAL EMBEDDINGS<|>USER ENGAGEMENT GRAPH<|>Unimodal embeddings are derived from the user engagement graph, representing the relevance between users and items in a d-dimensional space.<|>7)\r\n##\r\n(\"relationship\"<|>RELEVANCE VARIABLE<|>USER ENGAGEMENT GRAPH<|>The relevance variable is defined within the context of the user engagement graph, indicating whether a user engages with a specific item.<|>6)\r\n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
