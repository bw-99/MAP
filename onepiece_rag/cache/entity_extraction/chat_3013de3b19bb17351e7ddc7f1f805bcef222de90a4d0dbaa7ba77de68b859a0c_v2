We partition the sample of rating data into two complementary subsets, perform the user similarity analysis on one subset, which occupies 80% of the whole dataset, hiding the other 20% ratings and trying to predict them. The predicted rating is then compared with the real rating and the difference (in absolute value) is the prediction error. The mean absolute error (MAE) is adopted as the performance measure.\nTo reduce variability, we perform 5 rounds of the above operations using different partitions for each algorithm, and the prediction results are averaged over the rounds. For the sake of fairness in comparison, we try different α values and then select the optimal value 0.3 for use for iTrace-III and iTrace-IV.\nThe comparison result, in terms of averaged MAE per rating prediction, is presented in Fig. 4. It is shown that trust based methods outperform the traditional CF significantly and that the iTrace-I algorithm beats all the other competitors. It also indicates that Eqn.( 4) is preferable to Eqn. (5) and Eqn.( 7) is preferable to Eqn. (9) for use in implementing iTrace. Note that, since the implicit trust inference procedure is performed offline, the computation time of iTrace for online rating prediction is similar to the traditional CF method. <h2>publication_ref</h2>['b4', 'b8']<h2>figure_ref</h2>['fig_2']<h2>table_ref</h2>[]<h2>heading</h2>CONCLUSIONS<h2>text</h2>In this paper, we proposed an improved CF algorithm termed iTrace, which is featured by an embedded powerful implicit trust inference method. This method can estimate the implicit trust relationship between a pair of users based on available but very limited explicit trust information among users. The result from an extensive experiment on a public dataset demonstrates the superiority of our algorithm to existent competitors. Future work lies in using the proposed technique to analyze more datasets. How to model and employ more social interactions among users and the temporal dynamics in the users' rating behaviors to improve CF is also a promising topic for future investigation.<h2>publication_ref</h2>[]<h2>figure_ref</h2>[]<h2>table_ref</h2>[]<h1>references</h1><h2>ref_id</h2>b0<h2>title</h2>Recommender systems<h2>journal</h2>Communications of the ACM<h2>year</h2>1997<h2>authors</h2>P Resnick; H R Varian<h2>ref_id</h2>b1<h2>title</h2>Item-based collaborative filtering recommendation algorithms<h2>journal</h2><h2>year</h2>2001<h2>authors</h2>B Sarwar; G Karypis; J Konstan; J Riedl<h2>ref_id</h2>b2<h2>title</h2>Evaluating collaborative filtering recommender systems<h2>journal</h2>ACM Transactions on Information Systems<h2>year</h2>2004<h2>authors</h2>J L Herlocker; J A Konstan; L G Terveen; J T Riedl<h2>ref_id</h2>b3<h2>title</h2>Advances in collaborative filtering<h2>journal</h2>Springer<h2>year</h2>2015<h2>authors</h2>Y Koren; R Bell<h2>ref_id</h2>b4<h2>title</h2>An algorithmic framework for performing collaborative filtering<h2>journal</h2>ACM<h2>year</h2>1999<h2>authors</h2>J L Herlocker; J A Konstan; A Borchers; J Riedl<h2>ref_id</h2>b5<h2>title</h2>Empirical analysis of predictive algorithms for collaborative filtering<h2>journal</h2>Morgan Kaufmann Publishers Inc<h2>year</h2>1998<h2>authors</h2>J S Breese; D Heckerman; C Kadie<h2>ref_id</h2>b6<h2>title</h2>Unifying user-based and item-based collaborative filtering approaches by similarity fusion<h2>journal</h2>ACM<h2>year</h2>2006<h2>authors</h2>J Wang; A P De; M J Vries;  Reinders<h2>ref_id</h2>b7<h2>title</h2>Merging trust in collaborative filtering to alleviate data sparsity and cold start<h2>journal</h2>Knowledge-Based Systems<h2>year</h2>2014<h2>authors</h2>G Guo; J Zhang; D Thalmann<h2>ref_id</h2>b8<h2>title</h2>Trust-aware collaborative filtering for recommender systems<h2>journal</h2>Springer<h2>year</h2>2008<h2>authors</h2>P Massa; P Avesani<h2>ref_id</h2>b9<h2>title</h2>Trust-aware recommender systems<h2>journal</h2>ACM<h2>year</h2>2007<h\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}}
