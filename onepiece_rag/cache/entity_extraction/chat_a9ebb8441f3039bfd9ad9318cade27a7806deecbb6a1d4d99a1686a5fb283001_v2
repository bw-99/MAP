The assumption is that users with similar preferences will rate items similarly. Thus missing ratings for a user can be predicted by first finding a neighborhood of similar users and then aggregate the ratings of these users to form a prediction.\nThe neighborhood is defined in terms of similarity between users, either by taking a given number of most similar users (k nearest neighbors) or all users within a given similarity threshold. Popular similarity measures for CF are the Pearson correlation coefficient and the Cosine similarity. These similarity measures are defined between two users u x and u y as\nsim Pearson ( x, y) = i∈I ( x i ¯ x)( y i ¯ y) (|I| -1) sd( x) sd( y) (1) and sim Cosine ( x, y) = x • y x y ,(2)\nwhere x = r x and y = r y represent the row vectors in R with the two users' profile vectors. sd(•) is the standard deviation and • is the l 2 -norm of a vector. For calculating similarity using rating data only the dimensions (items) are used which were rated by both users.\nNow the neighborhood for the active user N (a) ⊂ U can be selected by either a threshold on the similarity or by taking the k nearest neighbors. Once the users in the neighborhood are found, their ratings are aggregated to form the predicted rating for the active user. The easiest form is to just average the ratings in the neighborhood.\nraj = 1 |N (a)| i∈N (a) r ij (3)\nAn example of the process of creating recommendations by user-based CF is shown in Figure 1.\nTo the left is the rating matrix R with 6 users and 8 items and ratings in the range 1 to 5 (stars). We want to create recommendations for the active user u a shown at the bottom of the matrix. To find the k-neighborhood (i.e., the k nearest neighbors) we calculate the similarity between the active user and all other users based on their ratings in the database and then select the k users with the highest similarity. To the right in Figure 1 we see a 2-dimensional representation of the similarities (users with higher similarity are displayed closer) with the active user in the center. The k = 3 nearest neighbors (u 1 , u 2 and u 3 ) are selected and marked in the database to the left. To generate an aggregated estimated rating, we compute the average ratings in the neighborhood for each item not rated by the active user. To create a top-N recommendation list, the items are ordered by predicted rating. In the small example in Figure 1 the order in the top-N list (with N ≥ 4) is i 2 , i 1 , i 7 and i 5 . However, for a real application we probably would not recommend items i 7 and i 5 because of their low ratings. ? 4.0 4.0 2.0 1.0 2.0 ? ? 3.0 ? ? ? 5.0 1.0 ? ? 3.0 ? ? 3.0 2.0 2.0 ? 3.0 4.0 ? ? 2.0 1.0 1.0 2.0 4.0 1.0 1.0 ? ? ? ? ? 1.0 ? 1.0 ? ? 1.0 1.0 ? 1.0 ? ? 4.0 3.0 ? 1.0 ? 5.0 3.5 4.0 2.3 2.0\ni 1 i 2 i 3 i 4 i 5 i 6 i 7 i 8 u 1 u 2 u 3 u 4 u 5 u 6 u a r̂a (a) (b) 0.3 1.0 0.2 0.3 0.1 0.1 u a u 1 u 2 u 3 u 4 u 5 u 6 0.3 1.0 0.2 0.3 0.1 0.1 u a u 1 u 2 u 3 u 4 u 5 u 6 (c)<h2>publication_ref</h2>['b12', 'b34', 'b39']<h2>figure_ref</h2>[]<h2>table_ref</h2>[]<h2>heading</h2>R s a<h2>text</h2>Figure 1: User-based collaborative filtering example with (a) rating matrix R and estimated ratings for the active user, (b), similarites between the active user and the other users s a (Euclidean distance converted to similarities), and (b) the user neighborhood formation.\nThe fact that some users in the neighborhood are more similar to the active user than others (see Figure 1 (b)) can be incorporated as weights into Equation (3).<h2>publication_ref</h2>[]<h2>figure_ref</h2>[]<h2>table_ref</h2>[]<h2>heading</h2>raj = 1<h2>text\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}}
