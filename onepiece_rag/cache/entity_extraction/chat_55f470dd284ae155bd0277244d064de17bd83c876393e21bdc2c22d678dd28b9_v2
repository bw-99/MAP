Lemma 1. For any k such as µ(T k ) < +∞ we have\nc(T k ) = max A∈Σ,µ(A)≤µ(T k ) c(A). Moreover, if µ(A) ≤ µ(T k ) and c(A) = c(T k ), then A ⊆ T k almost-everywhere.\nThe context of this lemma is very similar to the knapsack problem [Martello, 1990]. In this problem, one needs to find a subset A of a finite set of items {x 1 , ..., x n } maximizing the total value Σ xi∈A v(x i ) under the constraint that the total weight Σ xi∈A w(x i ) of A does not exceed a predefined maximum weight w * .\nIn Lemma 1, the total value is c(A), the ratio of an element's value to its weight becomes µ(A)-2 po(x), and the weight constraint is expressed as µ(A) ≤ µ(T k ).\nThe solutions given by the lemma correspond to those yielded for the knapsack problem by George Dantzig's greedy approximation algorithm [Dantzig, 1957]. This algorithm consists of ordering elements by decreasing value-to-weight ratio and then taking the N first elements. N is chosen in such a way, that taking one more element would cause excessive weight. The process of proving Lemma 1 is similar to proving that George Dantzig's solutions are optimal for their respective weights.\nProof of Lemma 1. Let's consider T k such that µ(T k ) < +∞. To prove c(T k ) is the maximum, we need to show for any\nA ∈ Σ, that c(A) ≤ c(T k ) if µ(A) ≤ µ(T k ). As A = (A ∩ T k ) ∪ (A \\ T k ) and T k = (A ∩ T k ) ∪ (T k \\ A), requiring c(A) ≤ c(T k ) is equivalent to requiring A\\T k (µ(A)-2 po(x))dµ(x) ≤ T k \\A (µ(T k )-2 po(x))dµ(x).\n(2) By definition of T k , we have that po\n(x) > k for x ∈ A \\ T k , while po(x) ≤ k for x ∈ T k \\ A. Therefore, A\\T k (µ(A) -2 po(x))dµ(x) ≤ µ(A \\ T k )(µ(A) -2k),\n(3) and\nT k \\A (µ(T k ) -2 po(x))dµ(x) ≥ µ(T k \\ A)(µ(T k ) -2k). (4) The constraint µ(A) ≤ µ(T k ) means that µ(A \\ T k ) ≤ µ(T k \\ A). Thus, we have µ(A \\ T k )(µ(A) -2k) ≤ µ(T k \\ A)(µ(T k ) -2k). (5)\nFinally, combining Eq. ( 5) with Eq. (3) and Eq. ( 4) guarantees the inequality in Eq. ( 2) under the constraint µ(A) ≤ µ(T k ).\nLet us now consider A ∈ Σ such that µ(A) ≤ µ(T k ) and c(A) = c(T k ). We now proceed to show that A ⊆ T k almost everywhere. If c(A) = c(T k ), the inequality in Eq. ( 2) must be an equality. Under the assumption µ(A) ≤ µ(T k ), we again have the inequalities in Eq. (3), Eq. ( 4) and Eq. ( 5), which must be equalities if Eq. ( 2) is an equality. However, because po(x) > k for x ∈ A \\ T k , the inequality in Eq. ( 3) can only become an equality if µ(A \\ T k ) = 0. Now everything is in place to prove the theorem.\nProof of Theorem 1. Let us first prove that the at least k-Pareto optimal elements T k offer maximum choice. Lemma 1 says that on Σ the set T k maximises c for its respective measure. We assumed T k is a selection. At the same time, for any selection c = cho. It means that T k offers maximum choice for its respective measure. Moreover, from Lemma 1 and from S ⊆ Σ directly results that if a selection A offers maximum choice for µ(T k ), then A ⊆ T k almost everywhere.\nThe theorem does not guarantee uniqueness. For example, in the case of the relation ≤ on R and the Lebesgue measure, selections are all left-unbounded intervals and the choice of any selection is 0. However, if for any selection\nA ⊂ T k & µ(A) < µ(T k ) =⇒ cho(A) < cho(T k ), (6)\nthen T k is a unique maximum. This is a direct consequence from the fact that T k contains any other selection offering maximum choice for µ(T k ) < +∞. Also, the proof of the theorem indicates that transitivity is not necessary. The set T k is only required to be a selection. This is the case for Lebesgue area measure and the non-transitive relation R defined on the unit square by (\nx 1 , x 2 )R (y 1 , y 2 ) iff y1 2 ≤ x 1 ≤ y 1 and y2 2 ≤ x 2 ≤ y 2 . The sets T k fulfill the requirement of be- ing selections if R * satisfies the weakened transitivity condition xR *\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}}
