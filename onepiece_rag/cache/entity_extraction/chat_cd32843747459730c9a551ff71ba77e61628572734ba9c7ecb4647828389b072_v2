(103\n)\nWith p n p s = p e ‚â§ 3 2 ‚Ä¢ ln n n for all n sufficiently large, we note that\np s ‚â§ 3 2 ln n np n . (104\n)\nNow, fix n large enough such that (102) and (104) hold. We consider the cases p n ‚â§ 1 ln n and p n > 1 ln n , separately. In the former case, we have F (n) ‚â§ 2p s e 3/4 immediately from (103). In the latter case we use the bound (104) to get\nF (n) ‚â§ 3 ln n np n e 3 4 pn ln n < 3 (ln n) 2 n ‚Ä¢ n 3/4\nupon noting that p n ‚â§ 1.

Note that (74) also follows since the extra condition p e n = ‚Ñ¶( 1) is used only once in obtaining (96) which holds trivially for ‚Ñì = 0.

(106)\nIn order to establish (106), we evaluate P[D x,‚Ñì ‚à©D y,‚Ñì ‚à©E xy ] proceeding similarly as in the proof of Proposition 1. To this end, we define the series of events B h in the following manner\nB h = (|N xy | = h) (|N xy | = ‚Ñì -h -1) (|N xy | = ‚Ñì -h -1) . (107\n)\nfor each h = 0, 1, . . . , ‚Ñì -1.

(108\n)\nThe minus one term on ‚Ñì is due to the fact that x and y are adjacent on event E xy ; there can be at most ‚Ñì -1 nodes that are neighbors of both x and y on D x,‚Ñì ‚à© D y,‚Ñì ‚à© E xy . Given (108) and mutually exclusive events B h (h = 0, 1, . . . , ‚Ñì -1), we obtain\nP[D x,‚Ñì ‚à© D y,‚Ñì ‚à© E xy ] = ‚Ñì-1 h=0 P [B h ‚à© E xy ] .(109)\nWe will establish Proposition 2 by obtaining the following result which evaluates the R.H.S. of (109). \nP [B h ‚à© E xy ] = o ‚Ñì h=0 P A h ‚à© K xy . (110\n)\nIn order to see why Proposition 2 follows from Proposition 2.1, observe that (110) establishes (106) with the help of (109). As noted before, this establishes Proposition 2. \nP [B h ‚à© E xy ] = P B h ‚à© Kn u=1 Y u = Kn u=1 P [B h ‚à© Y u ] .(111)\nGiven\nY u = [(|S xy | = u) ‚à© C xy ],\nwe obtain\nP [B h ‚à© Y u ] ‚â§ P [B h ‚à© (|S xy | = u)] .(112)\nApplying ( 112) to (111), it follows that\n‚Ñì-1 h=0 P [B h ‚à© E xy ] ‚â§ ‚Ñì-1 h=0 Kn u=1 P [B h ‚à© (|S xy | = u)] = Kn u=1 P[|S xy | = u] ‚Ä¢ ‚Ñì-1 h=0 P [B h | (|S xy | = u)] .(113)\nR.H.S. of ( 113) is similar to the R.H.S. of (87), whence it will be computed in a similar manner.
