In other words, distant nodes in dense areas will have less interaction, even if they are in a dense connected area. To alleviate the phenomenon, we propose a Curvature-based Homophily Constraint (𝜅HC) to enhance the connection within linked pairs. The basic idea is to push the embeddings of linked nodes closer if their ORC value is larger than a threshold. In this way, we can enforce disjoint node pairs in dense areas or clusters to have more Table 1: Comparisons of the abilities of models in terms of global tree-likeness modeling (Global), local heterogeneous structure learning (Local), and neighbor interaction (Neighbor) are indicated by ✓ for the presence of the ability and × for its absence. </p><h2>publication_ref</h2> <p>['b17', 'b20'] </p><h2>figure_ref</h2> <p>[] </p><h2>table_ref</h2> <p>[] </p><h2>heading</h2> <p>Model Type Models Global Local Neighbor </p><h2>text</h2> <p>Shallow models\nEUC × × × HYP ✓ × × Euclidean GNN models GCN × × ✓ GAT × × ✓ SAGE × × ✓ SGC × × ✓ Curvature GNN models CurvGN × ✓ ✓ 𝜅GCN ✓ × ✓ Hyperbolic GNN models HGCN ✓ × ✓ LGCN ✓ × ✓ Curvature-aware HGNN model 𝜅HGCN ✓ ✓ ✓\ninfluence on each other through their mutual neighbors, which is given by:\nL 𝜅ℎ𝑐 + = - 1 |𝐸 𝜅 | ∑︁ (𝑖,𝑗 ) ∈𝐸 𝜅 log 𝑝 (x ℓ,H 𝑖 , x ℓ,H 𝑗 ),(22)\nwhere 𝐸 𝜅 is the filtered edge set based on ORC threshold 𝜏 3 ; 𝑝 (•) is the Fermi-Dirac function, indicating the probability of two hyperbolic nodes (𝑢, 𝑣) link or not, which is given by:\n𝑝 (x 𝑢 , x 𝑣 ) = exp (𝑑 2 H (x 𝑢 , x 𝑣 ) -𝑟 )/𝑡 + 1 -1 ,(23)\nand 𝑑 H (x 𝑢 , x 𝑣 ) is the hyperbolic distance from 𝑢 to 𝑣, 𝑟 and 𝑡 is hyper parameters and we set it as previous work [11].

HMP helps build the connection between the graph topology and the embedding space, adjust the curvature of the hyperbolic geometry, and guide the information flow. It also shortens the distance of two linked nodes in an area with many triangles, helping mitigate the distortion caused by hyperbolic space. Nonetheless, HMP is local inherently, and the proposed 𝜅HC further enhances the interactions of unconnected nodes, which is non-local. </p><h2>publication_ref</h2> <p>['b10', 'b73'] </p><h2>figure_ref</h2> <p>[] </p><h2>table_ref</h2> <p>[] </p><h2>heading</h2> <p>𝜅HGCN Architecture </p><h2>text</h2> <p>Given the Euclidean feature x 𝐸 , we first project it into the hyperbolic manifold by the exponential map. 𝜅HGCN architecture takes layers of HMP as the encoder. Following the literature, the Fermi-Dirac function is used as a decoder in the link prediction task. For the node classification task, the final hyperbolic vector is mapped back to tangent space and decoded with MLP, which is the same with work [11]. 3 We select edges if their ORC value is larger than a threshold where edges can be constructed by multiple hop neighbors and the weight is added their curvature together based on their shortest distance.  </p><h2>publication_ref</h2> <p>['b10'] </p><h2>figure_ref</h2> <p>[] </p><h2>table_ref</h2> <p>[] </p><h2>heading</h2> <p>EXPERIMENTS 5.1 Experimental Setup </p><h2>text</h2> <p>Datasets. The evaluation of our work utilizes several datasets, including Disease, Airport, and three benchmark citation networks, namely PubMed and Cora. While Disease and Airport exhibit a more hierarchical structure, the citation networks are less so, making them suitable for demonstrating the generalization capability of our proposal.
