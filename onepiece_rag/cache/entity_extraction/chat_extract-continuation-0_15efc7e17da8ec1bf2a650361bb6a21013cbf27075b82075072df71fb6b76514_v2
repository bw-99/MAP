This is presented in Appendix F.\nThe emphasis of this paper is to show the generality of the k 2 Q framework by demonstrating via several task models. The tests and analytical results in the framework are with low complexity, but can still be shown to provide good results through speed-up factor or utilization bound analyses. We also note a somehow surprising finding through developing this framework: in the past, exponential-time schedulability tests were typically not recommended and most of time ignored, as this requires very high complexity. We have successfully shown in this paper that exponential-time schedulability tests may lead to good polynomial-time tests (almost automatically) by using the k 2 Q framework. Therefore, this framework may also open the possibility to re-examine some tests with exponentialtime complexity to improve their applicability.<h2>publication_ref</h2>['b14', 'b9', 'b2', 'b8', 'b7', 'b45', 'b0', 'b23', 'b0', 'b43', 'b5']<h2>figure_ref</h2>[]<h2>table_ref</h2>[]<h2>heading</h2>Basic Task and Scheduling Models<h2>text</h2>This section presents the sporadic real-time task model, as the basis for our presentations. Even though the framework targets at more general task models, to ease the presentation flow, we will start with the sporadic task models. A sporadic task τ i is released repeatedly, with each such invocation called a job. The j th job of τ i , denoted τ i,j , is released at time r i,j and has an absolute deadline at time d i,j . Each job of any task τ i is assumed to have execution time C i . Here in this paper, whenever we refer to the execution time of a job, we mean for the worst-case execution time of the job, since all the analyses we use are safe by only considering the worst-case execution time. The response time of a job is defined as its finishing time minus its release time. Successive jobs of the same task are required to be executed in sequence. Associated with each task τ i are a period T i , which specifies the minimum time between two consecutive job releases of τ i , and a deadline D i , which specifies the relative deadline of each such job, i.e., d i,j = r i,j + D i . The worst-case response time of a task τ i is the maximum response time among all its jobs. The utilization of a task τ i is defined as\nU i = C i /T i .\nA sporadic task system τ is an implicit-deadline system if D i = T i holds for each τ i . A sporadic task system τ is a constrained-deadline system if D i ≤ T i holds for each τ i . Otherwise, such a sporadic task system τ is an arbitrarydeadline system.\nA task is said schedulable by a scheduling policy if all of its jobs can finish before their absolute deadlines, i.e., the worst-case response time of the task is no more than its relative deadline. A task system is said schedulable by a scheduling policy if all the tasks in the task system are schedulable. A schedulability test expresses sufficient schedulability conditions to ensure the feasibility of the resulting schedule by a scheduling policy.\nThroughout the paper, we will focus on fixed-priority preemptive scheduling. That is, each task is associated with a priority level (except in Appendix F). For a uniprocessor system, the scheduler always dispatches the job with the highest priority in the ready queue to be executed. For a multiprocessor system, we consider multiprocessor global scheduling on M identical processors, in which each of them has the same computation power. For global multiprocessor scheduling, there is a global queue and a global scheduler to dispatch the jobs. We consider only global fixed-priority scheduling. At any time, the M -highest-priority jobs in the ready queue are dispatched and executed on these M processors.\nNote that the framework is not only limited to the above task and platform models. These terminologies are introduced only for the simplicity of presentation and illustrating some examples.<h2>publication_ref</h2>[]<h2>figure_ref</h2>[]<h2>table_ref</h2>[]<h2>heading</h2>Speed-Up Factor and Capacity Augmentation Factor:<h2>text</h2>To quantify the error of the schedulability tests or the scheduling policies, the concept of resource augmentation by using speedup factors [43] and the capacity augmentation factors [36] has been adopted. For example, global DM in general does not have good utilization bounds to schedule a set of sporadic tasks on M identical processors, due to \"Dhall's effect\" [26]. However, if we constrain the total utilization τi Ci M Ti ≤ 1 b , the density\nC k + τ i ∈hp(τ k ) Ci M D k ≤ 1\nb for each task τ k , and the maximum utilization max τi Ci min{Ti,Di} ≤ 1 b , it is possible to provide the schedulability guarantee of global RM by setting b to 3-1 M [2], [4], [10]. Such a factor b has been recently named as a capacity augmentation factor [36]. Note that the capacity augmentation bound was defined without taking this simple condition\nC k + τ i ∈hp(τ k ) Ci M D k ≤ 1\nb in [36], as they focus on implicit-deadline systems. For constrained-deadline systems, adding such a new constraint is a natural extension.\nAn algorithm A is with speed\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>K2Q FRAMEWORK<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The k 2 Q framework is a theoretical framework presented in the paper that demonstrates the generality of task models and their schedulability tests.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SPORADIC TASK MODEL<|>EVENT<|>The sporadic task model is a specific type of task model discussed in the paper, which is used as a basis for presentations on scheduling and task management.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SCHEDULABILITY TEST<|>EVENT<|>A schedulability test is a method used to determine if a task system can meet its deadlines under a given scheduling policy.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>FIXED-PRIORITY PREEMPTIVE SCHEDULING<|>EVENT<|>Fixed-priority preemptive scheduling is a scheduling policy where tasks are assigned priority levels, and the highest priority task is executed first.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MULTIPROCESSOR GLOBAL SCHEDULING<|>EVENT<|>Multiprocessor global scheduling refers to the scheduling of tasks across multiple processors, where a global queue and scheduler manage job dispatching.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>WORST-CASE EXECUTION TIME<|>EVENT<|>The worst-case execution time is the maximum time a job of a task can take to complete, which is crucial for schedulability analysis.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DHALl'S EFFECT<|>EVENT<|>Dhall's effect is a phenomenon that affects the utilization bounds of scheduling policies, particularly in global scheduling scenarios.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>K2Q FRAMEWORK<|>SPORADIC TASK MODEL<|>The k 2 Q framework demonstrates the generality of the sporadic task model in task scheduling<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SPORADIC TASK MODEL<|>SCHEDULABILITY TEST<|>The sporadic task model is used to evaluate the effectiveness of schedulability tests<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SCHEDULABILITY TEST<|>FIXED-PRIORITY PREEMPTIVE SCHEDULING<|>Schedulability tests are applied to determine if fixed-priority preemptive scheduling can meet task deadlines<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>FIXED-PRIORITY PREEMPTIVE SCHEDULING<|>MULTIPROCESSOR GLOBAL SCHEDULING<|>Fixed-priority preemptive scheduling can be implemented in a multiprocessor global scheduling environment<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>WORST-CASE EXECUTION TIME<|>SCHEDULABILITY TEST<|>The worst-case execution time is a critical factor in determining the outcomes of schedulability tests<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>DHALl'S EFFECT<|>MULTIPROCESSOR GLOBAL SCHEDULING<|>Dhall's effect impacts the performance and utilization bounds of multiprocessor global scheduling<|>4)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
