(20\n)\nProof: The proof is similar to the proof of Lemma 1. The detailed proof is in Appendix A. Not all the last release time orderings are safe for the worstcase response time analysis. Fortunately, similar to Lemma 2, we can safely consider only one specific last release time ordering of the k -1 higher-priority tasks as shown in the following lemma.\nLemma 7. The worst-case ordering π of the k -1 higherpriority tasks under the response bound in Eq. (20) in Lemma 6 is to order the tasks in a non-increasing order of βiCi αiUi , in which 0 < α i and 0 < β i for any i = 1, 2, . . . , k -1, 0 < t k .\nProof: The ordering of the k -1 higher-priority tasks in the indexing rule only matters for the term\nk-1 i=1 α i U i ( k-1 =i β C\n), which was already proved in the proof of Lemma 2 to be minimized by ordering the tasks in a non-increasing order of βiCi αiUi . Clearly, the minimization of\nk-1 i=1 α i U i ( k-1 =i β C\n) also leads to the maximization of Eq. (20), which concludes the proof.\nAs a result, thanks to the help of Lemma 7, we can conclude that π 1 in the example in this subsection is a safe last release time ordering to use Lemma 6 for the worst-case response time analysis. </p><h2>publication_ref</h2> <p>['b19'] </p><h2>figure_ref</h2> <p>[] </p><h2>table_ref</h2> <p>[] </p><h2>heading</h2> <p>Applications by Using Sporadic Task Models </p><h2>text</h2> <p>This section demonstrates how to use the k 2 Q framework to derive utilization-based schedulability and responsetime analyses for sporadic task systems in uniprocessor and multiprocessor systems. As sporadic real-time task models are the simplest scenarios that can demonstrate how to use k 2 Q, the content here is merely for explaining how to use the framework, but not for demonstrating the generality or superiority of k 2 Q. </p><h2>publication_ref</h2> <p>[] </p><h2>figure_ref</h2> <p>[] </p><h2>table_ref</h2> <p>[] </p><h2>heading</h2> <p>Uniprocessor Constrained-Deadline Systems </p><h2>text</h2> <p>Theorem 1. Task τ k in a sporadic task system with constrained deadlines is schedulable by the fixed-priority scheduling algorithm if\nk-1 i=1 Ci D k ≤ 1 and C k D k ≤ 1 - k-1 i=1 U i - k-1 i=1 C i D k + k-1 i=1 U i ( k-1 =i C ) D k ,(21)\nin which the k -1 higher-priority tasks in hp 1 (τ k ) are indexed in a non-increasing order of T i .\nProof: This comes from Lemma 1 and 2 based on the setting α i = 1 and β i = 1 to satisfy Definition 2. 4Theorem 2. Task τ k in a sporadic constrained-deadline task system with is schedulable by the rate-monotonic (RM) scheduling algorithm if\nC k D k ≤ 1 -2 k-1 i=1 U i + 0.5 ( k-1 i=1 U i ) 2 + ( k-1 i=1 U 2 i )(22)\nor\nk-1 i=1 U i ≤ k -1 k   2 -4 - 2k(1 -C k D k ) k -1   (23\n)\nor\nC k D k + k-1 i=1 U i ≤ k-1 k 2 -4 -2k k-1 if k > 3 1 -k-1 2k if k ≤ 3(24)\nProof: Under RM scheduling, we know that\nC i = U i T i ≤ U i T k .\nTherefore, α can be set to 1 and β can be set to 1 in Definition 4. Eq. ( 22) is due to Lemma 3, Eq. ( 23) is due to Lemma 4, and Eq. ( 24) is due to Lemma 5.\nThe above result in Theorem 2 leads to the utilization bound 2-√ 2 for implicit-deadline sporadic task systems under RM scheduling. This analysis is less precise than the Liu and Layland bound ln 2 ≈ 0.693, a simple implication by using k 2 U. However, if we are allowed to change the execution time and period of a task for different job releases (called acyclic task model in [1]), then the tight utilization bound 2 -√ 2 can be easily achieved by using k 2 Q, detailed in Appendix F. </p><h2>publication_ref</h2> <p>['b0'] </p><h2>figure_ref</h2> <p>[] </p><h2\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}}
