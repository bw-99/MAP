We slightly abuse the symbol\nA = [ α 1 , • • • , α N ]\nto denote all the continuous architecture parameters and W(A) to represent the downstream DNN parameters. Different from DARTS-style works [7], [17], [19] that use bi-level optimization to iteratively update A and W(A), we follow the setting of [36] and use one-level optimization to simultaneously train A and W(A) on the training set T . In addition to being time-consuming, [36] empirically demonstrated that bi-level optimization might downgrade the final performance due to the accumulation of errors from multiple approximations. On the other hand, we argue that there are many causes that can affect the performance and stability of bi-level optimization, such as the size of the validation set and the switch interval during iterative training. Hence, we adopt one-level optimization for practicality and efficiency by simultaneously updating A and W(A) via gradient descent as follows:\n∂ A L (T ; A, W (A)) and ∂ W(A) L (T ; A, W (A)).

Retraining the target DNN model with F and C A aims to eliminate suboptimal influence since the unpicked fields in F and the redundant embedding dimensions are also involved during the pretraining stage. </p><h2>publication_ref</h2> <p>[] </p><h2>figure_ref</h2> <p>[] </p><h2>table_ref</h2> <p>[] </p><h2>heading</h2> <p>Input Configuration Derivation </p><h2>text</h2> <p>Despite the hard selector argmax being widely used in previous DARTS-style work [17], [19], we argue that it can lead to an inconsistency between the pretraining model and the retraining model, resulting in inferior performance. For instance, assume there is a field that has three candidate dimensions with corresponding weights of 0.33, 0.33, 0.34. It is difficult to judge which operator is better since the gap is too small, and dropping all of the relatively smaller operators can lead to a dilemma that the total weight of the dropped operators is much higher than the selected one. Moreover, due to randomness during DNN model training, the derived optimal operators can also be unstable. To alleviate such issues, we set a cumulative probability threshold (CPT) to flexibly adjust the minimum amount of information kept in the retraining stage, supplemented with a pruning algorithm to derive the embedding dimension d fi for each field f i . The details are presented in Algorithm 1. The intuition behind this is that embedding regions with higher weights contain more effective information and should be retained in preference during pruning.\nRecall that d fi = 0 means that the corresponding field f i is useless and thus can be removed in the retraining stage. By applying Algorithm 1 to each field separately, we simultaneously complete feature selection and dimension search to obtain the pruned neural architecture of the retraining model. Compared with those selection algorithms based on the argmax operator, the proposed CPT-based pruning algorithm can generate more fine-grained embedding dimension configurations. Meanwhile, our algorithm can cover some common embedding search methods by flexibly adjusting the threshold. For example, the argmax operator in DART-style work [17], [19] becomes a special case with cpt = 0, while cpt = 1 means retaining all regions. </p><h\n######################\noutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}}
