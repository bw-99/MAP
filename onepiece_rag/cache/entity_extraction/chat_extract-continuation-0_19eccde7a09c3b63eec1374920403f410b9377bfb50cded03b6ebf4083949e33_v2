We evaluate ùúÖHGCN on both node classification and link prediction tasks. The data split is the same with the previous works [11]. More specifically, in link prediction, we randomly split edges into 85%, 5%, 10% for training, validation, and test sets, respectively. For node classification, we split nodes into 70%, 15%, 15% for Airport, 30%, 10%, 60% for Disease, and we use 20 labeled train examples per class for Cora, and PubMed. Implementation details. We closely follow the parameter settings as HGCN [11], fix the number of embedding dimensions to 16 and then perform hyper-parameter search on a validation set over learning rate, weight decay, dropout, and the number of layers. We also adopt the early stopping strategies based on the validation set as [11]. For baselines, we mainly refer to the reported results in the literature, and for the inconsistent cases (such as different embedding dimensions in H2H-GCN), we re-implement their official code in similar experimental settings.

The experimental results of node classification are summarized in TABLE 3, where a lower hyperbolicity value corresponds to a more tree-like structure. The key findings are: (1) Overall, the proposed model performs impressively, surpassing previous models on four out of five datasets. Specifically, hyperbolic models (e.g., HGCN, LGCN) perform substantially better on the more hyperbolic dataset (e.g., Disease) than on the less hyperbolic dataset; Euclidean models (e.g., GCN, GAT) find more success on the less hyperbolic datasets (e.g., Cora) than on the more hyperbolic dataset; whereas our model performs better on both datasets, which is consistent with our motivation, namely, that the graph can be better learned under the guidance of curvature. In addition, from the improvements of Œî ùúÖ , we discovered that CurvGN with discrete curvature and ùúÖGCN with continuous curvature both perform worse than our method which validates the power of hyperbolic geometry and the curvature-aware learning. (3) When it comes to Cora, both hyperbolic models and the proposed ùúÖHGCN fail to outperform Euclidean GAT [78], indicating Euclidean geometry is more suitable for modeling data with scarcely hierarchical structures. Nevertheless, it is noted that ùúÖHGCN still outperforms well-known Euclidean GCN models, e.g., GCN [35], SGC [83], SAGE [28]. It is observed that the proposed method ùúÖHGCN also helps to narrow down the gap between hyperbolic models and Euclidean GAT.\nLink Prediction. The experimental results of link prediction tasks are summarized in TABLE 4. In the link prediction task, we further have the following observations: (1) Compared with Euclidean 4 The results on Lorentz model are similar. counterparts, Our proposed ùúÖHGCN, and other hyperbolic models have achieved better performance. It is because hyperbolic space owns a larger embedding space, where the structural dependencies could be well preserved by the link prediction loss, providing more space or boundary for nodes to be well arranged; (2) In comparison with the advanced hyperbolic models, our model also obtains remarkable gains and refresh the records. According to the above extensive experiments, we are safe to conclude that equipping ORC with hyperbolic geometry further improves its generalization ability, obtaining high-quality representations for both tree-like and non-tree-like structured data. This confirms our primary motivation that the curvature carries rich information which is beneficial for graph representation learning in the embedding manifold\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>GCN<|>concept<|>GCN (Graph Convolutional Network) is a type of neural network designed to operate on graph-structured data, enabling the learning of node representations through convolutional operations on graphs.)\n(\"entity\"<|>GRAPH SAGE<|>concept<|>GraphSAGE (SAGE) is a framework for inductive learning on large graphs, which generates embeddings by sampling and aggregating features from a node's local neighborhood.)\n(\"entity\"<|>GRAPH ATTENTION NETWORKS<|>concept<|>Graph Attention Networks (GAT) utilize attention mechanisms to weigh the importance of neighboring nodes when generating node embeddings in a graph.)\n(\"entity\"<|>SIMPLIFIED GRAPH CONVOLUTION<|>concept<|>Simplified Graph Convolution (SGC) is a variant of GCN that simplifies the convolution operation to improve efficiency and performance.)\n(\"entity\"<|>CURVATURE GNN MODELS<|>concept<|>Curvature GNN models are a class of graph neural networks that incorporate curvature information to enhance learning on graph-structured data.)\n(\"entity\"<|>HYPERBOLIC GNNs<|>concept<|>Hyperbolic GNNs are graph neural networks that operate in hyperbolic space, allowing for better representation of hierarchical structures in data.)\n(\"entity\"<|>HGCN<|>concept<|>HGCN (Hyperbolic Graph Convolutional Network) is a model that leverages hyperbolic geometry to improve the learning of graph representations.)\n(\"entity\"<|>LINK PREDICTION<|>concept<|>Link prediction is a task in graph analysis that involves predicting the existence of a link between two nodes based on their features and relationships.)\n(\"entity\"<|>NODE CLASSIFICATION<|>concept<|>Node classification is a task where the goal is to assign labels to nodes in a graph based on their features and the structure of the graph.)\n(\"entity\"<|>DATA SPLIT<|>concept<|>Data split refers to the process of dividing a dataset into training, validation, and test sets for the purpose of model evaluation.)\n(\"entity\"<|>F1-SCORE<|>concept<|>F1-score is a metric used to evaluate the performance of a classification model, balancing precision and recall.)\n(\"entity\"<|>AUC<|>concept<|>Area Under Curve (AUC) is a performance measurement for classification models at various threshold settings, particularly used in binary classification tasks.)\n(\"entity\"<|>CURVGN<|>concept<|>Curvature Graph Network (CurvGN) is a model that applies discrete curvature in Euclidean space to enhance graph learning.)\n(\"entity\"<|>PRODGCN<|>concept<|>ProdGCN is a model that deploys graph neural networks to products of constant curvature spaces, contributing to the understanding of graph structures.)\n(\"relationship\"<|>GCN<|>GRAPH SAGE<|>GCN and GraphSAGE are both types of graph neural networks that aim to learn node representations from graph data<|>7)\n(\"relationship\"<|>GRAPH SAGE<|>GRAPH ATTENTION NETWORKS<|>GraphSAGE and GAT both focus on learning from local neighborhoods in graphs, but GAT incorporates attention mechanisms<|>8)\n(\"relationship\"<|>HGCN<|>HYPERBOLIC GNNs<|>HGCN is a specific type of hyperbolic GNN that utilizes hyperbolic geometry for graph representation learning<|>9)\n(\"relationship\"<|>LINK PREDICTION<|>NODE CLASSIFICATION<|>Both link prediction and node classification are tasks that can be performed using graph neural networks to analyze graph structures<|>6)\n(\"relationship\"<|>DATA SPLIT<|>NODE CLASSIFICATION<|>Data split is a crucial step in preparing datasets for node classification tasks, ensuring proper evaluation<|>7)\n(\"relationship\"<|>F1-SCORE<|>NODE CLASSIFICATION<|>F1-score is a metric commonly used to evaluate the performance of models in node classification tasks<|>8)\n(\"relationship\"<|>AUC<|>LINK PREDICTION<|>AUC is a performance metric specifically used to evaluate models in link prediction tasks<|>8)\n(\"relationship\"<|>CURVGN<|>CURVATURE GNN MODELS<|>CurvGN is a specific instance of curvature GNN models that applies discrete curvature to enhance graph learning<|>7)\n(\"relationship\"<|>PRODGCN<|>CURVATURE GNN MODELS<|>ProdGCN is another example of curvature GNN models that utilizes constant curvature spaces for graph learning<|>6) \n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
