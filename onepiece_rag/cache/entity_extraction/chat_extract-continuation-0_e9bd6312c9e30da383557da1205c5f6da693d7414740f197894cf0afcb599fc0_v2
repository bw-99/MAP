We treat the trust matrix T as a weighted directed graph G, in which the nodes denote the users and the weight of an edge denotes the trust of the starting vertex on the end vertex. For a pair of users, say u and v, there may be multiple paths originating from u and ending at v, as exemplified in the 3rd sub-figure of Fig. 2. To compute t(u, v), we first build up a reciprocal trust matrix Tr , whose (i, j)th cell tr (i, j) = 1/ t(i, j) if t(i, j) > 0; otherwise, set tr (i, j) = âˆž. We treat the reciprocal trust matrix as a weighted directed graph G r . An exemplary show of the transformation from G to G r is presented in Fig. 3. Then we consider a shortest path problem [17], which aims to find the shortest path from u to v, denoted by SP r (u, v), in G r . The Dijkstra's algorithm [18] is employed here to find SP r (u, v).\nThen we set t(u, v) as follows\nt(u, v) = 1 M Ã— L(SP r (u, v)) ,(7)\nwhere L(â€¢) and M denote the length of a path and the number of nodes except the starting node included in the shortest path, respectively. For the sake of clarity, consider the case shown in the right graph of Fig. 3, for which the shortest path from u\nto v, SP r (u, v), is u â†’ k â†’ v, L(SP r (u, v)) = tr (u, k) + tr (k, v) = 4, M = 2 and thus t(u, v) = 1/8.\nIf the pattern of the trust information flow from u to v does not belong to any of the above mentioned categories, it then must belong to the 4th category, for which we set t(u, v) = 0. It is worth noting that, given T , the computation of t(u, v) for all cases included in the 1st, 3rd and 4th categories can be unified by a single formula as follows\nt(u, v) = 1 M Ã— M-1 m=1 1 t(pm,pm+1) , (8\n)\nwhere  8), we can infer that, provided all the other conditions are the same, the bigger the value of M is or the smaller the value of t(p m , p m+1 ) is, the smaller the value of t(u, v) will be, and vice versa. The above effect is consistent with our intuitive understanding of the property of transitivity in the trust type relationships between a pair of users.\np 1 = u, p M = v and p 1 â†’ p 2 â†’ . . . â†’ p M is the shortest path in G r from u to v. </p><h2>publication_ref</h2> <p>['b16', 'b17'] </p><h2>figure_ref</h2> <p>['fig_1', 'fig_1'] </p><h2>table_ref</h2> <p>[] </p><h2>heading</h2> <p>Connections to related work </p><h2>text</h2> <p>The iTrace algorithm proposed here finds connections to several existent TaCF methods in the literature. The algorithm architecture of iTrace falls within a generic TaCF framework presented in [9], while the implicit inference procedure of iTrace presented here is unique. In a variety of existent TaCF methods [16,[19][20][21][22], the trust score is derived from the user rating data. To this regard, trust inference and the computation of user similarity are performed based on exactly the same information source. In contrast with the aforementioned work, the iTrace algorithm employs not only the user rating data but also data other than user rating, namely the explicit user trust data. Since the explicit trust data and the rating data are processed independently, the iTrace has the advantage of making full use of two complementary views in rating prediction. Furthermore, since the trust inference procedure can be performed offline prior to calculation of user similarity, the computation time of the iTrace for online rating predictions is similar to traditional CF methods. The iTrace algorithm also finds connections to our previous work on trust modeling in the context of wireless sensor networks [23][24][25]. Although the same term trust is used, its physical meaning is different. In iTrace, the term trust represents a classical social relationship among users, while in [23][24][25], it is an artificially designed concept related to abnormal sensory behaviors caused by sensor faults.\nTo our knowledge, the most similar work to our algorithm is a trust based CF method presented in [26], which has come to our attention only recently. In contrast with [26], we provide a new and more efficient way for readers to understand the shortest path based formulation of the trust inference problem by identifying four categories of trust information flow patterns and unifying three of them by a single formula, namely Eqn. (8). In addition, we consider two different ways, namely IW and LW as specified by Eqns.( 4) and ( 5), respectively, for fusion of trust and similarity; while in [26], only one way, i.e., LW, is considered. Further, the iTrace algorithm leverages the property of trust value attenuation in the trust propagation process by adding a penalization item M to the denominator of Eqn.( 7), while the method in [26] does\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>ITRACE ALGORITHM<|>CONCEPT<|>The iTrace algorithm is a method for finding connections in trust-based collaborative filtering, utilizing both user rating data and explicit user trust data to improve rating predictions.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>TRUST MATRIX<|>CONCEPT<|>The trust matrix T is a weighted directed graph representing the trust relationships between users, where nodes are users and edges denote the trust levels.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DIJKSTRA'S ALGORITHM<|>CONCEPT<|>Dijkstra's algorithm is a method used to find the shortest path in a graph, applied here to compute trust scores between users in the trust matrix.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>TRUST INFERENCE<|>CONCEPT<|>Trust inference is the process of deriving trust scores based on user interactions and ratings, which can be performed offline to enhance online rating predictions.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>USER RATING DATA<|>CONCEPT<|>User rating data refers to the feedback provided by users about items or services, which is used to compute trust scores and user similarity.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>COLLABORATIVE FILTERING<|>CONCEPT<|>Collaborative filtering is a method used in recommendation systems that relies on user interactions and ratings to suggest items to users.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>TRUST BASED CF METHOD<|>CONCEPT<|>A trust-based collaborative filtering method that utilizes trust relationships among users to enhance the accuracy of recommendations.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ITRACE ALGORITHM<|>TRUST MATRIX<|>The iTrace algorithm utilizes the trust matrix to compute trust scores between users based on their interactions<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ITRACE ALGORITHM<|>DIJKSTRA'S ALGORITHM<|>The iTrace algorithm employs Dijkstra's algorithm to find the shortest path in the trust matrix for trust inference<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>TRUST INFERENCE<|>USER RATING DATA<|>Trust inference is derived from user rating data, which is essential for calculating trust scores<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ITRACE ALGORITHM<|>TRUST INFERENCE<|>The iTrace algorithm performs trust inference to enhance rating predictions by utilizing both trust and user rating data<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>TRUST BASED CF METHOD<|>ITRACE ALGORITHM<|>The trust-based CF method is similar to the iTrace algorithm, as both leverage trust relationships for improved recommendations<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>COLLABORATIVE FILTERING<|>USER RATING DATA<|>Collaborative filtering relies on user rating data to suggest items to users based on their preferences<|>9)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
