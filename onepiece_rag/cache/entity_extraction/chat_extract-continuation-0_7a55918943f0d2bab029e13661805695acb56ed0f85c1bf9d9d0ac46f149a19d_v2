Now, we replace job J 1 with another job J 1 with inflated execution time in the above schedule, where J 1 is released at time z * with absolute deadline z 0 and execution time (z 0 -z * ) • ∆ max k . According to the above analysis, J 1 cannot be finished before z 0 in the above schedule. For each task τ i for i = 1, 2, . . . , k -1, in the above schedule, there may be one carry-in job, denoted as J i , of τ i (under the assumption of the schedulability of a higher-priority task τ i ) that arrives at time r i with r i < z * and r i + T i > z * . Let d i be the next released time of task τ i after z * , i.e., d i = r i + T i .\nAccording to the termination condition in the construction of z * , if J i exists, we know that at least (z * -r i ) • U i amount of execution time has been executed before z * , and the remaining execution time of job J i to be executed after z * is at most (d i -z * ) • U i . If J i does not exist, then d i is set to z * for notational brevity. Therefore, the amount of workload W i (t) of all the released jobs of task τ i for i = 1, 2, . . . , k -1 to be executed in time interval (z * , z * + t) is at most\nW i (t) = (d i -z * ) • U i + t -(d i -z * ) T i C i .(47)\nThe assumption of the unschedulability of job J 1 (due to the unschedulability of job J 1 ) under the global fixed-priority scheduling implies that J 1 cannot finish its computation at any time between z * and z 0 . This leads to the following\n(necessary) condition ∆ max k (z 0 -z * ) + τ i ∈hp(τ k ) W i (t) M > t for all 0 < t ≤ z * -z 0 for the unschedulability of job J 1 .\nTherefore, by the existence of y = z 1 -z * (with y ≥ 0) and ω i = d i -z * (with 0 ≤ ω i ≤ T i ) for i = 1, 2, . . . , k -1 to enforce the above necessary condition, we reach the conclusion of the proof by contrapositive. That is, task τ k is schedulable if, for all y ≥ 0 and any combination of 0 ≤ ω i ≤ T i for i = 1, 2, . . . , k -1, there exists 0\n< t ≤ D k + y with ∆ max k (D k + y) + τ i ∈hp(τ k ) ωi•Ui+ t-ω i T i Ci M ≤ t.\nThe schedulability condition in Lemma 9 may look at the first glance strange. We briefly explain the logical meaning (but informally) here. Suppose we would like to know whether a job of task τ k arrived at time r k can be finished before/at time r k + D k . To better quantify the interference from the higher-priority tasks, we would like to account for the higherpriority jobs arrived prior to r k . The variable y defines the extension of the window of interest from [r k , r k + D k ) to [r k -y, r k +D k ). The variable ω i defines the maximum residual execution time ω i T i of a carry-in job of task τ i that arrives before r k -y and should be executed in the window of interest, i.e., [r k -y, r k + D k ). If the residual workload is at most ω i T i , the next job can be released at time r k -y + ω i , as shown in the proof. Task τ k is schedulable by the global fixedpriority scheduling, if, for any combinations of y ≥ 0 and 0 ≤ ω i ≤ T i , ∀τ i ∈ hp(τ k ), we can always finish the inflated workload ∆ max k • (D k + y) of task τ k and the higher-priority workload in the window of interest. For formal explanations, please refer to the formal proof of Lemma 9.\nNote that the schedulability condition in Lemma 9 requires to test all possible y ≥ 0 and all possible settings of 0 ≤ ω i ≤ T i for the higher-priority tasks τ i with i = 1, 2, . . . , k -1. Therefore, it needs exponential time (for all the possible combinations of ω i ). 7 However, we are not going to directly use the test in Lemma 9 in the paper. We will only use this test to construct the corresponding k-point schedulability test under Definition 2.\nWe present the corresponding polynomial-time schedulability tests for global fixed-priority scheduling. More specifically, we will also analyze the capacity augmentation factors of these tests for global RM and global DM in Corollaries 3 and 4, respectively.\nTheorem 8. Let U max k be max k j=1 U j .
