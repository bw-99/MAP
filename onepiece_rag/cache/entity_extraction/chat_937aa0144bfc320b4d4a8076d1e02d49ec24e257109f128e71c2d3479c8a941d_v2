After selecting instancewise embedding dimensions, we separate samples into different groups based on a novel deterministic selection approach in the clustering stage. The retraining stage trains different recommender models, with optimal dimensions tailored to different groups. During inference time, each test sample will first be assigned to a suitable group, where predictions are made by the corresponding recommender model. We summarize our major contributions as:\n• We propose a hierarchical training framework that uses instance-wise \"Bernoulli gates\" to facilitate effective dimension search for each sample. • We apply a sparse and bi-polarization regularizer in the objective function to help the model learn distinguishable Bernoulli RVs, and use a threshold selector for downstream deterministic selection. • To balance the trade-off between the one-size-for-all and full-customization (which is not applicable with finite data size) strategies, we propose to divide samples into clusters and develop tailored recommender models for each cluster.\nWe empirically evaluate the performance of our framework on two large-scale benchmark datasets. Our experimental results indicate a notable superiority of our approach over various state-of-the-art baseline models on both datasets. Furthermore, the transferability analysis demonstrates our framework can be effectively transferred to diverse deep recommender models, thereby enhancing their performance. Additionally, our framework offers an efficiency advantage as it requires less inference time than competing baseline models. </p><h2>publication_ref</h2> <p>['b2', 'b26', 'b8', 'b38', 'b5', 'b7', 'b13', 'b25', 'b33', 'b7', 'b9', 'b28', 'b14', 'b24', 'b32', 'b31', 'b34', 'b17', 'b32'] </p><h2>figure_ref</h2> <p>[] </p><h2>table_ref</h2> <p>[] </p><h2>heading</h2> <p>RELATED WORK </p><h2>text</h2> <p>This section introduces the main related works to our study, focusing on feature-based recommender models and AutoML approaches for recommendation systems. </p><h2>publication_ref</h2> <p>[] </p><h2>figure_ref</h2> <p>[] </p><h2>table_ref</h2> <p>[] </p><h2>heading</h2> <p>Feature-based Recommender Models </p><h2>text</h2> <p>Feature-based recommender models take sparse, high-dimensional features from users and items as input and transform them into low-dimensional representations to capture user preferences for improved recommendations. For example, Cheng et al. [4] propose Wide&Deep (W&D), a model composed of a linear module and a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) layer to combine the benefits of memorization and generalization for recommender systems. Guo et al. [8] propose DeepFM that further integrates the power of factorization machines based on W&D to learn high-order feature interactions for recommendations. Recently, advanced neural networks, such as attention-based models [29], have been developed. However, these techniques apply a fixed embedding dimension for all features, which would downgrade the model performance and consume substantial computational resources. </p><h2>publication_ref</h2> <p>['b3', 'b7', 'b28'] </p><h2>figure_ref</h2> <p>[] </p><h2>table_ref</h2> <p>[] </p><h2>heading</h2> <p>AutoML for Recommendations </p><h2>text</h2> <p>Automated Machine Learning (AutoML) has recently become a research hotspot due to its potential to automate the design process for recommender systems, minimizing human involvement. The research directions include feature selection [15,33], embedding dimension search [37,38], model architecture search [5], and other component search [30,31,36]. Feature selection involves selecting a subset of field features in recommendation systems. For example, AutoField [33] uses a simple controller based on differentiable architecture search [16] to select the top 𝐾 field features. AdaFS [15] enhances AutoField by modifying the controller to assign feature weights to fields for different samples. The objective of embedding dimension search is to find mixed embedding sizes for each field. For example, AutoEmb [38] finds the optimal dimension for each feature using differentiable search [16]. AutoDim [37] selects the best dimension for each field from a group of candidate dimensions in the same way as AutoEmb. Model architecture search explores various network architectures and selects the optimal one [5].\nOur method is in alignment with embedding dimension search. All instances in the above methods share a uniform dimension size for each field. In contrast, our approach adaptively selects dimensions for each instance via the proposed Bernoulli gates, thereby considering the difference between individuals. Moreover, we introduce a polarization regularizer to overcome the shortcomings of the commonly-used top 𝐾 selection strategy. Furthermore, rather than processing all samples through a single model, we propose to divide samples into clusters and train different recommender models with optimal dimensions tailored to different clusters. These unique and innovative designs in our proposed method have been proven effective in terms of both performance enhancement and inference cost saving. </p><h2>publication_ref</h2> <p>['b14', 'b32', 'b36', 'b37', 'b4', 'b29', 'b30', 'b35', 'b32', 'b15',\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}}
