A straightforward example would be the selection step in genetic optimization algorithms [Mitchell, 1998]. At this step, a subset of the current population is chosen to advance to the next generation. Having the chosen subset made up of elements with large fitness values guides the evolution process in the desired direction. At the same time, selecting a subset with the largest variety of genes ensures variability of characteristics and allows faster exploration of the search space.\nThese examples bring us to the problem of generalizedfoot_0 topological sorting with choice maximisation which we also refer to as maximum choice problem. This problem aims to choose a subset of a predefined maximum size, consisting of most preferable items and containing the largest number of equally preferred elementsfoot_1 . To the best of our knowledge, this problems has not yet been studied in the literature. In this text, we propose a theoretical solution to the maximum choice problem and demonstrate how both the problem and its solution can be applied in practice.\nThe contributions of this work are the following:\n1. We formulate the maximum choice problem in a broad sense for arbitrary elements, preference relations R, and measures µ indicating the set sizes, see Section 2.\n2. We propose a solution based on the concept of k-Pareto optimality, whose definition relies on the relation R, see Section 3.\n3. We further investigate the proposed solution from a theoretical point of view and discover interesting characteristics, such as the relationship between k-Pareto optimal elements and the arc of hyperbola, see Section 4.\n4. Finally, we demonstrate the applicability of our approach to real-world problems by considering genetic optimization, see Section 5.<h2>publication_ref</h2>['b1', 'b39']<h2>figure_ref</h2>[]<h2>table_ref</h2>[]<h2>heading</h2>Sorting with Choice Maximization<h2>text</h2>To formally define the problem of maximization of choice, we introduce several definitions in Sections 2.1 and 2.2. The resulting formalization of this problem is abstract and quite general. However, this generality allows discovering novel connections and applying the developed theory to numerous practical problems. We also illustrate the defined concepts with an example in Section 2.3.<h2>publication_ref</h2>[]<h2>figure_ref</h2>[]<h2>table_ref</h2>[]<h2>heading</h2>Definitions<h2>text</h2>We consider a set X with a binary relation R. Intuitively xRy means that x is preferable to y. The case xRy and not yRx means that x is strictly preferable to y. This situation is denoted by xR * y. We also consider a positive and σ-finite measure µ [Halmos, 2013] defined on X. Thus, we have a measure space (X, Σ, µ), where Σ is a set of subsets of X, and µ intuitively indicates the size of these subsets. To ensure measurability, throughout this text the characteristic function 1 R of the relation R is assumed to be sufficiently regular 5 . The µ can be defined in different ways. Important examples are the counting measure and probability measures P . Depending on the definition of µ, it can indicate the following characteristics of the elements in X: how many?, how likely?, how important?, or what volume?\nTo illustrate these definitions, we consider the following example. Let X be a set of possible habitations of which the user has to choose the best according to his preferences encoded by the relation R. In such a situation, the relation R can be multidimensional. Let us assume, for simplicity, that an optimal habitation for the user is close to a given location, for example, his workplace (relation R l ), is situated in a district with a smaller population size (relation R p ), and is close to a river (relation R r ). Thus, the user's preferences can be represented by the preorder relation R = R l &R p &R r . In our example, all available habitations from X can be mapped onto points in a 3dimensional space of Proximity to the location × Population × River. The fact that R is a preorder rela-5 1R is equal to 1 if xRy and is equal to 0 otherwise.\ntion means that some elements of X can be comparable, while others not. For example, the habitation x with coordinates (50, 100, T rue) is strictly preferable to y with coordinates (60, 100, T rue), that is xR * y.\nAt the same time, the habitation z with coordinates (40, 100, F alse) is incomparable with x. Indeed, z is better with respect to R l , it is situated closer to the required location, but x is better with respect to R r , as the latter is situated near a river.\nHaving the task to find a subset of X that is 'best' according to R, a rational solution can be formulated with the following recursive expression: if an element x is selected, then all elements that are strictly preferable to x should be also selected. In our example, this translates into the task of finding a subset of habitations S R that might be suitable for the user. Naturally, if y ∈ S R , then x ∈ S R as the latter corresponds better to the preferences of the user defined by the relation R. We formalize this rationality condition by defining selections as follows.\nDefinition 1. A selection S is a subset of X such that x ∈ S and yR * x implies y ∈ S. The set of all selections in Σ is denoted by\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}}
