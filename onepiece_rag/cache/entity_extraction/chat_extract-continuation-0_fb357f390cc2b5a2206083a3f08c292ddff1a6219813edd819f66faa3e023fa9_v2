The steps to compute Σ cross are elaborated in Algorithm 1. For recursive updates of Σ cross we use follow-the-leader (FTL) strategy which is prominently used in online density estimation and active learning Azoury & Warmuth (2001); Dasgupta & Hsu (2007). Details on the implementation and synthetic data experiments are provided in the Appendix A.8.\nsc-OTGM samples transportation paths (vectors) directly from the OT landscape, rooted in the perturbation distribution Z, within a dimensionally reduced subspace: x path ∼ N (µ kp , Σ kp ), which effectively captures the essence of gene expression dynamics under perturbation. The high-dimensional gene expression profiles corresponding to these paths are reconstructed via inverse PCA, expressed as:\nx ′′ path = x path V T m\n, where V m represents the matrix comprising the top m eigenvectors derived from the covariance matrix of the pre-processed gene expression data. See Appendix A.4 and A.5 for more details. For each gene expression profile within the OT landscape, we derive a parametric representation, as follows:\nµ gene,i = the i th element of (µ kp V T m ) and σ 2 gene,i = the i th diagonal entry of (V m Σ kp V T m ),\nwhere µ gene,i denotes the degree of change in a gene's expression in response to perturbation, indicating potential activation or suppression of the gene. σ gene,i quantifies the confidence in these expression changes, providing insights into the variability of our computations. While biological systems are often complex and nonlinear, under specific conditions or within certain ranges, linear approximations can provide valuable insights and simplify modeling efforts. van Someren et al. (2000) presents a methodology for modeling genetic networks that employs clustering to tackle the dimensionality problem and a linear model to infer the regulatory interactions. By analyzing the covariance matrix Σ kp of the perturbation distribution, we can explore the interconnected behavior between genes, examining how they co-vary or influence each other. Consider the scenario where the expression level of gene i changes, denoted as ∆X i . The covariance matrix Σ kp , upon transformation via V m , becomes\nΣ ′′ kp = V m Σ kp V T m .\nThe expected change in gene j's expression level, ∆X j , resulting from a change in gene i, is linearly approximated as follows:\n∆X j = Σ ′′ kp,ij Σ ′′ kp,ii ∆X i (5)\nAlgorithm 1 Estimation of Cross-Covariance Matrix via Hit-and-Run Markov Chain Monte Carlo 1: Input: Domains D X and D Y with non-zero density for X and Y , number of iterations N , mean vectors µ X , µ Y , covariance matrices Σ X , Σ Y , and confidence interval for the bounds α. 2: Output: Estimated cross-covariance matrix Σ XY .\n3: Initialize (x (0) , y (0) ) uniformly from D X × D Y . 4: Initialize Σ (0)\nXY as a random matrix, ensuring it is symmetric and positive definite. 5: Compute the z-score, z, for the specified confidence interval α using the inverse of the standard normal CDF:\nz = Φ -1 1+α 2 . 6: for i = 1 to N do 7: Calculate non-zero density bounds [a X , b X ] for X: 8: Generate a random unit direction d X in X's space. 9: Normalize d X to unit length: d X,normalized = d X ∥d X ∥ 10: Project x (i-1) onto d X,normalized : p X,projection = x (i-1) • d X,normalized 11: Compute standard deviation σ X,projection = d T X,normalized Σ X d X,normalized 12: Determine [a X , b X ] using p X,projection ± z • σ X,projection 13: Calculate non-zero density bounds [a Y , b Y ] for Y : 14: Generate a random unit direction d Y in Y 's space. 15: Normalize d Y to unit length: d Y,normalized = d Y ∥d Y ∥ 16: Project y (i-1) onto d Y,normalized : p Y,projection = y (i-1) • d Y,normalized 17: Compute standard deviation σ Y,projection = d T Y,normalized Σ Y d Y,normalized 18: Determine [a Y , b Y ] using p Y,projection ± z • σ Y,projection 19: Update Σ XY : 20: Sample x (i) ∼ Uniform(a X , b X ) and Sample y (i) ∼ Uniform(a Y , b Y ) 21: ∆x (i) = x (i) -µ X , ∆y (i) = y (i) -µ Y 22: Σ (i) XY = i i+1 Σ (i-1) XY + i (i+1) 2 ∆x (i) (∆y (i) ) T\n▷ FTL Online Density Estimation 23: end for<h2>publication_ref</h2>['b12', 'b5', 'b7', 'b28', 'b21', 'b8', 'b27']<h2\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>VAN VALKENHOOF & TERVONEN<|>PERSON<|>Researchers who contributed to the study on the uniform distribution over a convex polytope in 2015)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SMITH<|>PERSON<|>Researcher who discussed convergence in distribution to the target distribution in 1996)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>AZOURY & WARMUTH<|>PERSON<|>Researchers who proposed the follow-the-leader strategy used in online density estimation in 2001)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DASGUPTA & HSU<|>PERSON<|>Researchers who contributed to the understanding of active learning in 2007)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ALGORITHM 1<|>EVENT<|>A specific algorithm used for estimating the cross-covariance matrix via Hit-and-Run Markov Chain Monte Carlo)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>APPENDIX A.8<|>EVENT<|>Section of the document providing details on the implementation and synthetic data experiments)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GENE EXPRESSION DYNAMICS<|>EVENT<|>The study of how gene expression levels change in response to perturbations)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CROSS-COVARIANCE MATRIX<|>EVENT<|>A statistical representation used to understand the relationship between two random variables)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>VAN VALKENHOOF & TERVONEN<|>SMITH<|>Both researchers contributed to the understanding of statistical distributions in their respective studies<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>AZOURY & WARMUTH<|>DASGUPTA & HSU<|>Both pairs of researchers worked on methodologies related to online density estimation and active learning<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ALGORITHM 1<|>CROSS-COVARIANCE MATRIX<|>Algorithm 1 is used to estimate the cross-covariance matrix<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>GENE EXPRESSION DYNAMICS<|>CROSS-COVARIANCE MATRIX<|>Gene expression dynamics can be analyzed using the cross-covariance matrix to understand gene interactions<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>APPENDIX A.8<|>ALGORITHM 1<|>Appendix A.8 provides details on the implementation of Algorithm 1<|>6)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
