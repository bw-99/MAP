Random key graphs have received much interest recently, owing in part to their wide applicability in various domains including recommender systems, social networks, secure sensor networks, clustering and classification analysis, and cryptanalysis to name a few. In this paper, we study connectivity properties of random key graphs in the presence of unreliable links. Unreliability of the edges are captured by independent Bernoulli random variables, rendering edges of the graph to be on or off independently from each other. The resulting model is an intersection of a random key graph and an Erdős-Rényi graph, and is expected to be useful in capturing various real-world networks; e.g., with secure WSN applications in mind, link unreliability can be attributed to harsh environmental conditions severely impairing transmissions. We present conditions on how to scale this model's parameters so that i) the minimum node degree in the graph is at least k, and ii) the graph is k-connected, both with high probability as the number of nodes becomes large. The results are given in the form of zeroone laws with critical thresholds identified and shown to coincide for both graph properties. These findings improve the previous results by Rybarczyk on the k-connectivity of random key graphs (with reliable links), as well as the zero-one laws by Yagan on the 1-connectivity of random key graphs with unreliable links.<h1>sections</h1><h2>heading</h2>I. INTRODUCTION<h2>text</h2>Random key graphs have received significant interest recently with applications spanning key predistribution in secure wireless sensor networks (WSNs) [2], [5], [8], [9], [13], social networks [7], [18], [41], recommender systems [27], clustering and classification analysis [4], [19], cryptanalysis of hash functions [3], circuit design [35], and the modeling of epidemics [1] and \"small-world\" networks [38]. They belong to a larger class of random graphs known as random intersection graphs [2]- [7], [10], [14], [28], [34], [35]; in fact, they are referred to as uniform random intersection graphs by some authors [2], [3], [6], [28], [32]- [34], [45], [46].\nTo fix the terminology, we will describe random key graphs in the context of secure WSNs, where they have originated from. Security is expected to be a key challenge in resource constrained sensor networks. A widely accepted solution for securing WSN communications is the random predistribution of cryptographic keys to sensor nodes, and utilization of\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}}
