For example, dim(), dimnames(), colCounts(), rowCounts(), colMeans(), rowMeans(), colSums() and rowSums(). Additionally sample() can be used to sample from users (rows) and image() produces an image plot.\nFor ratingMatrix we provide two concrete implementations realRatingMatrix and binaryRatingMatrix to represent different types of rating matrices R. realRatingMatrix implements a rating matrix with real valued ratings stored in sparse format defined in package Matrix. Sparse matrices in Matrix typically do not store 0s explicitly, however for realRatingMatrix we use these sparse matrices such that instead of 0s, NAs are not explicitly stored.\nbinaryRatingMatrix implements a 0-1 rating matrix using the implementation of itemMatrix defined in package arules. itemMatrix stores only the ones and internally uses a sparse representation from package Matrix. With this class structure recommenderlab can be easily extended to other forms of rating matrices with different concepts for efficient storage in the future.\nClass Recommender implements the data structure to store recommendation models. The creator method\nRecommender(data, method, parameter = NULL)\ntakes data as a ratingMatrix, a method name and some optional parameters for the method and returns a Recommender object. Once we have a recommender object, we can predict top-N recommendations for active users using predict(object, newdata, n=10, type=c(\"topNList\", \"ratings\", \"ratingMatrix\"), ...).\nPredict can return either top-N lists (default setting) or predicted ratings. object is the recommender object, newdata is the data for the active users. For top-N lists n is the maximal number of recommended items in each list and predict() will return an objects of class topNList which contains one top-N list for each active user. For \"ratings\" and \"ratingMatrix\", n is ignored and an object of realRatingMatrix is returned. Each row contains the predicted ratings for one active user. The difference is, that for \"ratings\", the items for which a rating exists in newdata have a NA instead of a predicted/actual ratings.\nThe actual implementations for the recommendation algorithms are managed using the registry mechanism provided by package registry. The registry called recommenderRegistry and stores recommendation method names and a short description. Generally, the registry mechanism is hidden from the user and the creator function Recommender() uses it in the background to map a recommender method name to its implementation. However, the registry can be directly queried by recommenderRegistry$get_entries() and new recommender algorithms can be added by the user. We will give and example for this feature in the examples section of this paper.\nTo evaluate recommender algorithms package recommenderlab provides the infrastructure to create and maintain evaluation schemes stored as an object of class evaluationScheme from rating data. The creator function evaluationScheme(data, method=\"split\", train=0.9, k=10, given=3)\ncreates the evaluation scheme from a data set using a method (e.g., simple split, bootstrap sampling, k-fold cross validation). Testing is perfomed by withholding items (parameter given). Breese et al. (1998) introduced the four experimental witholding protocols called Given 2, Given 5, Given 10 and All-but-1. During testing, the Given x protocol presents the algorithm with only x randomly chosen items for the test user, and the algorithm is evaluated by how well it is able to predict the withheld items. For All-but-x, a generalization of All-but-1, the algorithm sees all but x withheld ratings for the test user. given controls x in the evaluations scheme. Positive integers result in a Given x protocol, while negative values produce a All-but-x protocol.\nThe function evaluate() is then used to evaluate several recommender algorithms using an evaluation scheme resulting in a evaluation result list (class evaluationResultList) with one entry (class evaluationResult) per algorithm. Each object of evaluationResult contains one or several object of confusionMatrix depending on the number of evaluations specified in the evaluationScheme (e.g., k for k-fold cross validation). With this infrastructure several recommender algorithms can be compared on a data set with a single line of code.\nIn the following, we will illustrate the usage of recommenderlab with several examples.<h2>publication_ref</h2>['b2']<h2>figure_ref</h2>['fig_3']<h2>table_ref</h2>[]<h2>heading</h2>Examples<h2>text</h2>This fist few example shows how to manage data in recommender lab and then we create and evaluate recommenders.
