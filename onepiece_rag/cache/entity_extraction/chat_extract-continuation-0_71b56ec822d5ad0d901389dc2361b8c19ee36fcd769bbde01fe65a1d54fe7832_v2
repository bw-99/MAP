A PROOF OF PROPOSITION 4 </p><h2>text</h2> <p>We start by introducing some notation. For any non-empty subset U of nodes, i.e., U ‚äÜ v 1 , . . . , v n , we define the graph G on (U ) (with vertex set U ) as the subgraph of G on restricted to the nodes in U . If all nodes in U are deleted from G on , the remaining graph is given by G on (U c ) on the vertices U c = v 1 , . . . , v n  \\ U . Let N U c denote the collection of all nonempty subsets of v 1 , . . . , v n  \\ U . We say that a subset T in N U c is isolated in G on (U c ) if there are no edges (in G on ) between the nodes in T and the nodes in U c \\ T . This is characterized by\nE ij , v i ‚àà T, v j ‚àà U c \\ T.\nWith each non-empty subset T ‚äÜ U c of nodes, we associate several events of interest: Let C T denote the event that the subgraph G on (T ) is itself connected. The event C T is completely determined by the random variables (rvs) S i , v i ‚àà T  and C ij , v i , v j ‚àà T . We also introduce the event D U,T to capture the fact that T is isolated in G on (U c ), i.e., D U,T :=\nvi‚ààT vj ‚ààU c \\T E ij .\nFinally, we let B U,T denote the event that each node in U has an edge with at least one node in T , i.e., B U,T :=\nvi‚ààU vj ‚ààT E ij .\nWe also set\nA U,T := B U,T ‚à© C T ‚à© D U,T .\nThe proof starts with the following observations: In graph G on , if the connectivity is ‚Ñì (i.e., Œ∫ = ‚Ñì) and yet each node has degree at least ‚Ñì + 1 (i.e., Œ¥ > ‚Ñì), then there must exist subsets U , T of nodes with\nU ‚àà N , |U | = ‚Ñì and T ‚àà N U c , |T | ‚â• 2, such that G on (T ) is connected while T is isolated in G on (U c\n). This ensures that G on can be disconnected by deleting an appropriately selected set of ‚Ñì nodes; i..e, nodes in U . Notice that, this would not be possible for sets T in N U c with |T | = 1, since the degree of a node in T is at least ‚Ñì+1 by virtue of the event Œ¥ > ‚Ñì; this ensures that a single node in T is connected to at least one node in U c \\ T . Moreover, the event Œ∫ = ‚Ñì also enforces G on to remain connected after the deletion of any ‚Ñì -1 nodes. Therefore, if there exists a subset U (with |U | = ‚Ñì) such that some T in N U c is isolated in G on (U c ), then each of the ‚Ñì nodes in U should be connected to at least one node in T and to at least one node in U c \\ T . This can easily be seen by contradiction: Consider subsets U ‚àà N with |U | = ‚Ñì, and T ‚àà N U c with |T | ‚â• 2, such that there exists no edge between the nodes in T and the nodes in U c \\ T . Suppose there exists a node v i in U such that v i is connected to at least one node in U c \\ T but is not connected to any node in T . Then, G on can be disconnected by deleting the nodes in U \\ v i  since there will be no edge between the nodes in T and the nodes in v i  ‚à™ U c \\ T . But, |U \\ v i | = ‚Ñì -1, and this contradicts the fact that Œ∫ = ‚Ñì.\nThe inclusion\n[(Œ∫ = ‚Ñì) ‚à© (Œ¥ > ‚Ñì)] ‚äÜ U‚ààN n,‚Ñì , T ‚ààN U c : |T |‚â•2 A U,T\nis now immediate with N n,r denoting the collection of all subsets of v 1 , . . . , v n  with exactly r elements. It is also easy to check that this union need only be taken over all subsets T of v 1 , . . . , v n  with 2 ‚â§ |T | ‚â§ ‚åä n-‚Ñì 2 ‚åã. We now use a standard union bound argument to obtain\nP (Œ∫ = ‚Ñì) ‚à© (Œ¥ > ‚Ñì) ‚à© E(J ) ‚â§ U‚ààN n,‚Ñì ,T ‚ààN U c : 2‚â§|T |‚â§‚åä n-‚Ñì 2 ‚åã P A U,T ‚à© E(J ) = ‚åä n-‚Ñì 2 ‚åã r=2 U‚ààN n,‚Ñì ,T ‚ààN U c ,r P A U,T ‚à© E(J )(147)\nwith N U c ,r denoting the collection of all subsets of U c with exactly r elements.\nFor each r = 1, . . . , n‚Ñì -1, we simplify the notation by writing A ‚Ñì,r := A v1,...,v ‚Ñì\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>PROPOSITION 4<|>concept<|>Proposition 4 refers to a specific statement or theorem being proved in the context of graph theory, particularly concerning the connectivity and isolation of subsets of nodes in a graph.)\n(\"entity\"<|>GRAPH G<|>concept<|>Graph G is a mathematical structure consisting of nodes and edges, used to model pairwise relationships among entities.)\n(\"entity\"<|>SUBSET U<|>concept<|>Subset U is a non-empty collection of nodes from the graph G, which is used to analyze the properties of the graph when certain nodes are removed.)\n(\"entity\"<|>SUBSET T<|>concept<|>Subset T is a collection of nodes that is isolated in the graph G when certain nodes from subset U are removed, affecting the connectivity of the graph.)\n(\"entity\"<|>ISOLATED SUBSET<|>concept<|>An isolated subset is a group of nodes in a graph that has no edges connecting them to another specified subset of nodes, indicating a lack of connectivity.)\n(\"entity\"<|>CONNECTIVITY<|>concept<|>Connectivity refers to the minimum number of nodes that must be removed to disconnect the remaining nodes in a graph, denoted as Œ∫.)\n(\"entity\"<|>DEGREE<|>concept<|>Degree is the number of edges connected to a node in a graph, denoted as Œ¥, which influences the connectivity of the graph.)\n(\"entity\"<|>EVENTS<|>concept<|>Events are specific occurrences or conditions related to the properties of subsets of nodes in the graph, such as connectivity and isolation.)\n(\"relationship\"<|>PROPOSITION 4<|>GRAPH G<|>Proposition 4 discusses the properties of graph G, particularly in relation to the connectivity and isolation of subsets of nodes<|>9)\n(\"relationship\"<|>SUBSET U<|>GRAPH G<|>Subset U is a part of graph G, used to analyze the effects of removing certain nodes on the graph's connectivity<|>8)\n(\"relationship\"<|>SUBSET T<|>GRAPH G<|>Subset T is defined in relation to graph G, specifically regarding its isolation from other nodes<|>8)\n(\"relationship\"<|>ISOLATED SUBSET<|>SUBSET T<|>An isolated subset is characterized by the absence of edges connecting it to other nodes in the graph, particularly in relation to subset T<|>7)\n(\"relationship\"<|>CONNECTIVITY<|>SUBSET U<|>The connectivity of graph G is influenced by the presence and properties of subset U, as its removal affects the overall structure<|>6)\n(\"relationship\"<|>DEGREE<|>CONNECTIVITY<|>The degree of nodes in the graph is a critical factor in determining the connectivity, as higher degrees can prevent disconnection<|>7)\n(\"relationship\"<|>EVENTS<|>SUBSET T<|>Events are associated with the properties of subset T, particularly regarding its connectivity and isolation in the graph<|>6) \n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
