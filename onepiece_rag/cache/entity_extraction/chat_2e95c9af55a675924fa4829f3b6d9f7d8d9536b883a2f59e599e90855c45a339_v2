During these pretrain epochs, the Bernoulli gates are always deterministically open (no matter what embedding representation it receives). Then, after we've obtained a tentative reliable embedding representation, we initialize the parameters for the Bernoulli gates and start the stochastic selection. Later we adopt the bi-level optimization strategy [12,24] to disjointly update the parameters ùíò in Bernoulli gates and the parameters {ùëΩ, ùúΩ } b in the base recommender model.<h2>publication_ref</h2>['b11', 'b14', 'b23', 'b32', 'b34', 'b14', 'b11', 'b23']<h2>figure_ref</h2>[]<h2>table_ref</h2>[]<h2>heading</h2>Searching Stage. As mentioned in<h2>text</h2><h2>publication_ref</h2>[]<h2>figure_ref</h2>[]<h2>table_ref</h2>[]<h2>heading</h2>Clustering Stage.<h2>text</h2>In the clustering stage, we can obtain the masked embedding representations using the embedding tables and Bernoulli gates which have been trained during the searching stage. Remember we use deterministic selection mode for Bernoulli gates to generate embedding masks in this clustering stage. For each sample, compute its Euclidean distance to the centroid using the masked embedding representations, then assign it to the nearest centroid (group), and later update the centroids.<h2>publication_ref</h2>[]<h2>figure_ref</h2>[]<h2>table_ref</h2>[]<h2>heading</h2>Retraining Stage.<h2>text</h2>As to the retraining stage, we first divide all samples via the trained K-Means cluster. Then we find the majority dimensions for each group from their embedding masks using the deterministic mode. After that, we initialize the deep recommender model 1 and 2 by their corresponding optimal dimensions and train them separately using the samples of each cluster.<h2>publication_ref</h2>[]<h2>figure_ref</h2>[]<h2>table_ref</h2>[]<h2>heading</h2>EXPERIMENT<h2>text</h2>In this section, we conduct extensive experiments to evaluate our proposed framework. Specifically, the main research questions we care about are as follows:\n‚Ä¢ RQ1: How does iHAS perform compared with other mainstream selection methods? ‚Ä¢ RQ2: Can the proposed iHAS be successfully transferred to more powerful recommender models? ‚Ä¢ RQ3: How does each component contribute to the overall performance of the proposed iHAS? ‚Ä¢ RQ4: Does the proposed iHAS demonstrate efficiency when compared to baseline models? ‚Ä¢ RQ5: Does iHAS construct rational recommender model structures?<h2>publication_ref</h2>[]<h2>figure_ref</h2>[]<h2>table_ref</h2>[]<h2>heading</h2>Datasets<h2>text</h2>We conduct our experiments mainly on two commonly used public datasets, Avazu 1 and Criteo 2 , which are both large-scale realworld datasets and serve as benchmarks in click-through rate (CTR) prediction tasks. Table 1 presents the detailed statistics of both datasets. Each dataset has been randomly segmented into training/validation/testing sets based on the proportions of 80%, 10%, and 10%.\n‚Ä¢ Avazu dataset consists of 40 million users' click records on ads over 11 days. Each record contains 22 categorical field features. Following the general preprocessing steps [29,40],\n1 https://www.kaggle.com/c/avazu-ctr-prediction/ 2 https://www.kaggle.com/c/criteo-display-ad-challenge/ we group fields of which frequency is less than ten as a single field \"others\". ‚Ä¢ Criteo dataset consists of 46 million users' click records on display ads. Each record contains 26 categorical fields and 13 numerical fields. we use the preprocessing method as Avazu for the low-frequency fields (less than ten) and transform each numerical field ùë• by ùëôùëúùëî 2 (ùë•) if ùë• > 2.<h2>publication_ref</h2>['b28', 'b39']<h2>figure_ref</h2>[]<h2>table_ref</h2>['tab_1']<h2>heading</h2>Evaluation Metrics<h2>text</h2>Following the previous works [17,25], we evaluate the performance of our method using two common metrics: AUC and Logloss. AUC refers to the area under the ROC curve, which means the probability that a model will rank a randomly selected positive instance higher than a randomly selected negative one. A higher AUC value indicates superior model performance. On the other hand, Logloss, aka binary cross-entropy loss, directly quantifies the model's performance, with a lower score denoting more accurate predictions. Note that a marginal 0.001-level improvement in AUC (increase) or Logloss (decrease) is perceived as a significant enhancement in model performance [19,33,37].<h2>publication_ref</h2>['b16', 'b24', 'b18', 'b32', 'b36']<h2>figure_ref</h2>[]<h2>table_ref</h2>[]<h2>heading</h2>Baseline Methods<h2>text</h2>We compare our proposed\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}}
