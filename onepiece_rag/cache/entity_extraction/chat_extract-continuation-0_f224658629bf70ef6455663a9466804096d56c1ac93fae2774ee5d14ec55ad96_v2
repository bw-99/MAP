The analysis in [31] is limited degree-based aggregation and Euclidean space. The hyperbolic message passing learning paradigm of ùúÖHGCN also shows a similar phenomenon, which causes too much influence loss in long-term propagation. Especially, if the paths consist of numerous connections to other nodes, the node influence is minimal. For clarity, we term the hyperbolic message passing learning paradigm in ùúÖHGCN or original HGNNs [11,45,96] as HMP.
