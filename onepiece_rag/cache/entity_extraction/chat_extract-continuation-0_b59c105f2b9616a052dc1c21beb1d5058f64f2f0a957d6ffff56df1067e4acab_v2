Thus, in the discussion given below, we will establish (73) for each â„“ = 0, 1, . . . under p e n = â„¦(1), and show that this extra condition is not needed if â„“ = 0.\nWe start by finding an upper bound on the left hand side (L.H.S.) of (73). Given the definition of X u in (68), we obtain\nP [A h âˆ© X u ] â‰¤ P [A h âˆ© (|S xy | = u)] .\nThen, we have\nâ„“ h=0 Kn u=1 P [A h âˆ© X u ] â‰¤ â„“ h=0 Kn u=1 P [A h âˆ© (|S xy | = u)] = Kn u=1 P[|S xy | = u] â€¢ â„“ h=0 P [A h | (|S xy | = u)] .

(89\n)\nFrom E xj = C xj âˆ© K xj and E yj = C yj âˆ© K yj , it is clear that E xj and E yj are independent of (|S xy | = u).
