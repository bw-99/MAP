This is extremely helpful to alleviate the overfitting effect in the factor investing case when the number of predictors (F = 56 in our implementation) is comparable to the number of training samples (T = 200). Though we apply a basic linear regression for stock prediction, the sparse models with L 1 and L 2 penalties can be easily extended to support more sophisticated models such as nonlinear models using customized kernel functions.<h2>publication_ref</h2>[]<h2>figure_ref</h2>[]<h2>table_ref</h2>[]<h2>heading</h2>Financial Factors<h2>text</h2>For factor computation, we adopt the result of a latest white paper on the target stock market [Tsi18], which recommends six types of 56 factors with each factor characterizes a key aspect of a stock:\n• Transaction friction: 17 factors delineating overall status of a company (e.g., firm size by its market value, age of a firm) and transaction statistics (e.g., volatility, risks measured by stock returns compared with the market return); • Momentum: 5 factors computing daily stock returns in the recent 6/12 months, the change of momentum, and specially defined momentums; • Value: 8 factors including the famous book-to-market ratio proposed by Fama and French [FF92], the asset-to-market ratio, and other company performance related ratios; • Growth: 11 factors describing the growth of a company's asset, debt, market value, sales, profit, tax, etc; • Profitability: 8 factors quantifying return on equity, return on asset, and other factors related to company profits; • Liquidity: 7 factors characterizing the liquidity performance of a company, including current ratio, quick ratio, cash flow to debt ratio, etc.\nFor the above factors, the ranges of their values differ significantly from each other. Also, their values can change dramatically along with the stock market. Since all the factor values are normalized initially, the relative importance of each factor can be assessed, which can facilitate the factor analysis. The sparse regression model in iQUANT outputs three measures to delineate the importance of each factor in the prediction. Take the jth factor in the ith trading cycle (e.g., daily, monthly or quarterly) as an example, the three measures are as follows:\n• Factor weight learned in the model, denoted by w (i) j ;\n• Factor value changing in a daily basis, denoted by X (i) ; • Contribution of factors to the prediction of daily stock returns, denoted by\n∑ T +iD k=T +(i-1)D+1 w (i) j x k j .\nBy collecting the feedback from traders in our pilot study, we further extracted three metrics that are widely-used in industry to delineate the utilization of each factor. These two metrics are visualized in iQUANT to aid the interactive factor selection and stock portfolio construction process.\n• Sensitivity: a metric that indicates whether the utilization of a factor can be replaced by other factors. The sensitivity is computed by (ξ i jξ i ) + where ξ i j denotes the prediction error by removing the jth factor from sparse regression models, ξ i denotes the prediction error of the original model; • Stability: a good factor for the predictive model should have stable contributions in a long period of time before confidently applied. Quantitatively, it is measured by the number of times the factor's contribution to a stock's prediction flips from negative to positive or from positive to negative.<h2>publication_ref</h2>['b15']<h2>figure_ref</h2>[]<h2>table_ref</h2>[]<h2>heading</h2>Visualization<h2>text</h2><h2>publication_ref</h2>[]<h2>figure_ref</h2>[]<h2>table_ref</h2>[]<h2>heading</h2>Control Panel<h2>text</h2>The control panel in Figure 2(a) allows users to select an initial pool of stocks for analysis (T1). S/he can input the stock code to select an individual stock or choose an entire sector of stocks from a sector list. All the selected stocks will appear in the bottom part of the control panel, aggregated by sectors. Next, users need to specify a time period and a model for factor investing. Finally, users click the \"Draw\" button to visualize factors related to the selected stocks.<h2>publication_ref</h2>[]<h2>figure_ref</h2>['fig_2']<h2>table_ref</h2>[]<h2>heading</h2>Factor View<h2>text</h2>Factor view (Figure 2 To meet the above design requirements, we propose a customized visual design to integrate time-varying factor importance metrics in a single factor view. As shown in Figure 2(b), the x-axis of the view indicates a timeline divided into multiple time units (months by default). Each factor is visualized as a series of filled circles in these time units. On each circle, the color hue encodes factor type, the color opacity encodes the factor sensitivity to the model, and the circle radius represents the aggregated factor importance to all the selected stocks. Three importance metrics can be displayed by the checkboxes in the top row of the factor view: weight, value, and contribution (default). All the circles on the same time unit are vertically aligned by a fixed order of their corresponding factors to facilitate factor tracking and comparison along the timeline. As each factor can have a positive or negative contribution in different time\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>IQUANT<|>ORGANIZATION<|>iQUANT is a platform that utilizes sparse regression models for stock prediction and factor analysis in the financial market.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>FACTOR INVESTING<|>EVENT<|>Factor investing is an investment strategy that involves selecting securities based on attributes that are associated with higher returns.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>FACTOR VIEW<|>EVENT<|>Factor view is a visual representation of the importance metrics of various factors over time in stock analysis.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>TRANSACTION FRICTION<|>EVENT<|>Transaction friction refers to factors that delineate the overall status of a company and its transaction statistics.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MOMENTUM<|>EVENT<|>Momentum is a factor that computes daily stock returns over recent months and assesses changes in momentum.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>VALUE<|>EVENT<|>Value is a factor that includes ratios like book-to-market ratio and asset-to-market ratio to evaluate company performance.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GROWTH<|>EVENT<|>Growth is a factor that describes the increase in a company's assets, debt, market value, sales, profit, and tax.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PROFITABILITY<|>EVENT<|>Profitability is a factor that quantifies returns on equity and assets, reflecting a company's profit performance.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LIQUIDITY<|>EVENT<|>Liquidity is a factor that characterizes a company's liquidity performance through various financial ratios.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>IQUANT<|>FACTOR INVESTING<|>iQUANT utilizes factor investing strategies to enhance stock prediction and analysis<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>FACTOR VIEW<|>IQUANT<|>The factor view is a feature of iQUANT that visualizes factor importance metrics over time<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>FACTOR INVESTING<|>TRANSACTION FRICTION<|>Transaction friction is one of the factors considered in factor investing strategies<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>FACTOR INVESTING<|>MOMENTUM<|>Momentum is a key factor used in factor investing to assess stock performance<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>FACTOR INVESTING<|>VALUE<|>Value factors are integral to factor investing, influencing investment decisions<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>FACTOR INVESTING<|>GROWTH<|>Growth factors are analyzed in factor investing to evaluate potential stock performance<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>FACTOR INVESTING<|>PROFITABILITY<|>Profitability factors are assessed in factor investing to determine company performance<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>FACTOR INVESTING<|>LIQUIDITY<|>Liquidity factors are part of the analysis in factor investing strategies<|>6)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
