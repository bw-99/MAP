Note that for any σ > 0, lim λ↓0 λ e 2 σ λ 1-2λ = 0 so that the condition (134) can always be met by suitably selecting constant λ > 0 small enough. Also, we have lim µ↓0 e µ µ = 1, whence\nlim µ↓0 √ µ e µ µ\n= 0, and (135) can be made to hold for any constant σ > 0 by taking µ > 0 sufficiently small. Finally, we remark that the condition P n ≥ σn for some σ > 0 is equivalent to having P n = Ω(n). Proposition 4. Let ℓ be a non-negative constant integer. If K n ≥ 2 and P n ≥ σn for some σ > 0 for all n sufficiently large, Kn Pn = o(1), and (120) holds with β ℓ,n = o(ln n) and lim n→∞ β ℓ,n = +∞, then\nlim n→∞ P (κ = ℓ) ∩ (δ > ℓ) ∩ E(J ) = 0,\nwhere J = [J 2 , J 3 , . . . , J n ] is as specified in (131) with arbitrary ε in (0, 1), constant µ in (0, 1  2 ) selected small enough to ensure (135) and constant λ ∈ (0, 1  2 ) selected such that it satisfies (134).\nA proof of Proposition 4 is given in Section XI below.\nUsing Proposition 3 and Proposition 4 (with the same constants ε, λ, µ) in (132), we obtain the desired conclusion (126).
