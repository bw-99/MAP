Let p s = o(1), K n ≥ 2 for all n sufficiently large and p e = ln n+(k-1) ln ln n+αn n with lim n→∞ α n = -∞. Then, the following two properties hold.\n(a) If there exist an ǫ > 0 such that p e n > ǫ for all n sufficiently large, then for any non-negative integer constant ℓ, we have\nP[D x,ℓ ∩ D y,ℓ ∩ E xy ] ∼ (ℓ!) -2 (p e n) 2ℓ e -2pen . (58\n) (b) We have P[D x,0 ∩ D y,0 ∩ E xy ] ∼ e -2pen .(59)\nProposition 2. Let p s = o(1), K n ≥ 2 for all n sufficiently large and p e = ln n+(k-1) ln ln n+αn n with lim n→∞ α n = -∞. If there exists an ǫ > 0 such that p e n > ǫ for all n sufficiently large, then for any positive integer constant ℓ, we have\nP[D x,ℓ ∩ D y,ℓ ∩ E xy ] = o P[D x,ℓ ∩ D y,ℓ ∩ E xy ] . (60)\nPropositions 1 and 2 are established in Section VII and Section VIII, respectively. Now, we complete the proof of Lemma 3. Under the condition p e n > ǫ > 0, (55) follows from (58) and (60) in view of (57). For ℓ = 0, we obtain (56) by using (59) in (57) and noting that P[D x,0 ∩D y,0 ∩E xy ] = 0 always holds; it is not possible for nodes v x and v y to have degree zero and yet to have an edge in between.\nWe now complete the proof of ( 51) and ( 53) under ( 45) and (46). First, in view of ( 9) and the condition lim n→∞ α n = -∞, we obtain p e ≤ ln n+(k-1) ln ln n n for all n sufficiently large. Thus, p e = o 1\n√ n , and we use Lemma 2 to get\nnP [D x,ℓ ] ∼ n • (ℓ!) -1 (p e n) ℓ e -pen(61)\nfor each ℓ = 0, 1, . . .. The proof will be given in two steps. First, in the case where there exists an ǫ > 0 such that p e n > ǫ for all n sufficiently large, we will establish (51) and ( 53) for ℓ = k -1. Next, for the case where lim n→∞ p e n = 0, we will show that (51) and (53) hold for ℓ = 0. Assume now that p e n > ǫ > 0 for all n sufficiently large.
