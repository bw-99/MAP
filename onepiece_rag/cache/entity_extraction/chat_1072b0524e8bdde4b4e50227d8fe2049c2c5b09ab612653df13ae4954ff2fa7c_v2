When we consider more general cases, such as the generalized multiframe and multi-mode task models, we have to properly define the values of U i and C i to apply the framework.\nU i , ∀i < k C i , ∀i < k α i , ∀i < k β i , ∀i < k C k t k (for Lemmas 1-\nThe use cases of k 2 Q can be achieved by using the known schedulability tests (that are in the form of pseudo polynomialtime or exponential-time tests) or some simple modifications of the existing results. We will provide the explanations of the correctness of the selection of the parameters, α i , β i , C i , U i for a higher-priority task τ i to support the correctness of the results. Such a flow actually leads to the elegance and the generality of the framework, which works as long as Definition 2 (Definition 3, respectively) can be successfully constructed for the sufficient schedulability test (response time, respectively) of task τ k in a fixed-priority scheduling policy. The procedure is illustrated in Figure 1. With the availability of the k 2 Q framework, the quadratic bounds or utilization bounds can be automatically derived as long as the safe upper bounds α and β can be safely derived, regardless of the task model or the platforms.\nWe are not going to present how to systematically and automatically derive these parameters to be applied for the k 2 Q framework. For most of the typical schedulability tests and response time analyses in real-time systems, such a derivation procedure is similar to the automatic parameter generation for the k 2 U in [21]. </p><h2>publication_ref</h2> <p>['b20'] </p><h2>figure_ref</h2> <p>['fig_0'] </p><h2>table_ref</h2> <p>[] </p><h2>heading</h2> <p>Schedulability Test Framework </p><h2>text</h2> <p>This section provides five important lemmas for deriving the utilization-based schedulability test based on Definition 2. Lemma 1 is the most general test, whereas Lemmas 3, 4, and 5 work for certain special cases when β i C i ≤ βU i t k for any higher-priority task τ i . Lemma 2 gives the worst-case last release time ordering, which can be used when the last release time ordering for testing task τ k is unknown.\nLemma 1. For a given k-point last-release schedulability test, defined in Definition 2, of a scheduling algorithm, in which 0 < α i , and\n0 < β i for any i = 1, 2, . . . , k -1, 0 < t k , k-1 i=1 α i U i ≤ 1, and k-1 i=1 β i C i ≤ t k , task τ k is\nschedulable by the fixed-priority scheduling algorithm if the following condition holds\nC k t k ≤ 1- k-1 i=1 α i U i - k-1 i=1 (β i C i -α i U i ( k-1 =i β C )) t k .(5)\nProof: We prove this lemma by showing that the condition in Eq. ( 5) leads to the satisfactions of the schedulability conditions listed in Eq. ( 2) by using contrapositive. By taking the negation of the schedulability condition in Eq. ( 2), we know that if task τ k is not schedulable by the scheduling policy, then for each j = 1, 2, . . . , k\nC k + k-1 i=1 α i t i U i + j-1 i=1 β i C i > t j .(6)\nTo enforce the condition in Eq. ( 6), we are going to show that C k must have some lower bound, denoted as C * k . Therefore, if C k is no more than this lower bound, then task τ k is schedulable by the scheduling policy. For the rest of the proof, we replace > with ≥ in Eq. ( 6), as the infimum and the minimum are the same when presenting the inequality with ≥. The unschedulability for satisfying Eq. ( 6) implies that\nC k > C * k , where C * k is defined in the optimization problem: min C * k (7a) s.t. C * k + k-1 i=1 α i t * i U i + j-1 i=1 β i C i ≥ t * j , ∀j = 1, 2, . . . , k -1, (7b) t * 1 ≥ 0 (7c) t * j ≥ t * j-1 , ∀j = 2, 3, . . . , k -1,(7d)\nC * k + k-1 i=1 α i t * i U i + k-1 i=1 β i C i ≥ t k ,(7e)\nwhere t * 1 , t * 2 , . . . , t * k-1 and C * k are variables, α i , β i , U i , and C i are constants, and t k is a given positive constant. Moreover, it is obvious that relaxing the constraint t * j ≥ t * j-1 for j = 2,\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}}
