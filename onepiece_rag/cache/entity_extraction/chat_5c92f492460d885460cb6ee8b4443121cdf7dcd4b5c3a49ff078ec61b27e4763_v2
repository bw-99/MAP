Let z 1 be the arrival time of this job of task τ k . For notational brevity, let this job be J 1 , which arrives at time z 1 and has not yet been finished at time z 0 . By definition, we know that z 0 -z 1 is D k . Due to the fixed-priority and workload-conserving scheduling policy and the constraineddeadline setting, removing (1) all the other jobs of task τ k (except the one arriving at time z 1 ), (2) all the jobs arriving no earlier than z 0 , and (3) lower-priority jobs does not change the unschedulability of job J 1 . Therefore, the rest of the proof only considers the jobs from τ 1 , τ 2 , . . . , τ k . Now, we expand the window of interest by using a slightly different algorithm from that proposed in [7], also illustrated with the notation in Figure 3, as in Algorithm 1. The difference is only in the setting \"strictly less than (z -1 -z ) • Û units\", whereas the setting in [7] uses \"strictly less than (z -1 -z ) • s units\" for a certain s. For notationaly brevity, Û is the utilization of the task that generates job J .\nAlgorithm 1 (Revised) Forced-Forward Algorithm 1: for ← 2, 3, ... do 2:\nlet J denote a job that arrives at some time-instant z < z -1 ; -has an absolute deadline after z -1 ; -has not completed execution by z -1 ; and has executed for strictly less than (z -1 -z ) • Û units over the interval [z , z -1 ), where Û is the utilization of the task that generates job J .<h2>publication_ref</h2>['b6', 'b6', 'b6', 'b6', 'b6', 'b6']<h2>figure_ref</h2>['fig_5']<h2>table_ref</h2>[]<h2>heading</h2>3:<h2>text</h2>if there is no such a job then 4:\n← ( -1); break;\nSuppose that the forced-forward algorithm terminates with equals to * . We now examine the schedule in the interval (z * , z 0 ]. Since J 1 , J 2 , . . . , J * belong to τ 1 , τ 2 , . . . , τ k , we know that Û ≤ ∆ max k for = 1, 2, . . . , * . Let σ be the total length of the time interval over (z , z -1 ] during which J is executed. By the choice of J , it follows that\nσ < (z -1 -z ) • Û ≤ (z -1 -z ) • ∆ max k .\nMoreover, all the M processors execute other higher-priority jobs (than J ) at any other time points in the interval (z , z -1 ] at which J is not executed. Therefore, we know that the maximum amount of time from z * to z 0 , in which not all the M processors execute certain jobs, is at most\n* =1 σ < * =1 (z -1 -z ) • ∆ max k = (z 0 -z * ) • ∆ max k .\nUp to here, the treatment is almost identical to that in \"Observation 1\" in [7]. The following analysis becomes different as we do not intend to use the demand bound function. Now, we replace job J 1 with another job J 1 with inflated execution time in the above schedule, where J 1 is released at time z * with absolute deadline z 0 and execution time (z 0 -z * ) • ∆ max k . According to the above analysis, J 1 cannot be finished before z 0 in the above schedule. For each task τ i for i = 1, 2, . . . , k -1, in the above schedule, there may be one carry-in job, denoted as J i , of τ i (under the assumption of the schedulability of a higher-priority task τ i ) that arrives at time r i with r i < z * and r i + T i > z * . Let d i be the next released time of task τ i after z * , i.e., d i = r i + T i .\nAccording to the termination condition in the construction of z * , if J i exists, we know that at least (z * -r i ) • U i amount of execution time has been executed before z * , and the remaining execution time of job J i to be executed after z * is at most (d i -z * ) • U i . If J i does not exist, then d i is set to z * for notational brevity.
