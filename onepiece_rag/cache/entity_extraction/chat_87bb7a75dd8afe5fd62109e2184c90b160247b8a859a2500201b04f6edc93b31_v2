The notion of random key graph results from the seminal Eschenauer-Gligor (EG) random key predistribution scheme [4], which is the most recognized solution to secure communication using cryptographic keys in wireless sensor networks [10]. The definition of a random key graph can also be generalized beyond cryptographic keys. Consider a random key graph G(n, X n , Y n ) that is constructed on a set of n nodes as follows. Each node is independently assigned a set of X n distinct objects, selected uniformly at random from a pool of Y n objects, where X n and Y n are both functions of n. An undirected edge exists between two nodes if and only if they possess at least one common object. An object is a cryptographic key in the application of random key graphs to the Eschenauer-Gligor random key predistribution scheme. In addition to the area of secure sensor networks, random key graphs have also been used in various applications including cryptanalysis [1], social networks [12], and recommender systems [5].\n(k-)Connectivity of a random key graph has received much interest [2], [6], [7], [9], [10], [12], [13]. A graph is said to be k-connected if it remains connected despite the deletion of at most (k -1) nodes or edges 1 ; an equivalent definition of k-connectivity is that for each pair of nodes there exist at least k mutually disjoint paths connecting them [3]. In the case of k being 1, k-connectivity becomes connectivity, meaning that each node in the graph can find at least one path to any other node, either directly or with the help of other relaying nodes. A graph property related to and implied by k-connectivity is that the minimum degree of the the graph is at least k (i.e., each node is directly connected to no less than k other nodes), where the minimum degree refers to the minimum among the numbers of neighbors that nodes have.\nWe investigate k-connectivity of random key graphs. Our contribution is, for a random key graph, to derive the asymptotically exact probabilities for k-connectivity and the property that the minimum degree is at least k.\nThe rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section II presents the results. We elaborate the proof of Theorem 1 in Section III. Section IV provides numerical findings to support the theoretical results. Section V surveys related work; and Section VI concludes the paper.<h2>publication_ref</h2>['b0', 'b1', 'b4', 'b6', 'b8', 'b9', 'b11', 'b12', 'b3', 'b9', 'b0', 'b11', 'b4', 'b1', 'b5', 'b6', 'b8', 'b9', 'b11', 'b12', 'b2']<h2>figure_ref</h2>[]<h2>table_ref</h2>[]<h2>heading</h2>II. THE RESULTS<h2>text</h2>For a random key graph G(n, X n , Y n ), Theorem 1 and Corollary 1 below present the asymptotically exact probabilities for k-connectivity and the property of the minimum degree being at least k, where k is a positive integer and does not scale with n. The term ln stands for the natural logarithm function, and e is its base. We use the standard asymptotic notation O(•), o(•), Ω(•), ω(•), Θ(•), ∼; in particular, for two positive sequences x n and y n , the relation x n ∼ y n means lim n→∞ (x n /y n ) = 1. All asymptotic statements are understood with n → ∞. Also, P[E] denotes the probability that event E occurs.\nTheorem 1. For a random key graph G(n, X n , Y n ), let q n be the probability that there exists an edge between two nodes. With a sequence α n defined by\nq n = ln n + (k -1) ln ln n + α n n ,(1)\nthen under X n ≥ 2, it follows that\nlim n→∞ P G(n, X n , Y n ) is k-connected. = lim n→∞ P [ G(n, X n , Y n ) has a minimum degree at least k. ] =      0, if lim n→∞ α n = -∞, 1, if lim n→∞ α n = ∞, e -e -α * (k-1)! , if lim n→∞ α n = α * ∈ (-∞, ∞).(2)\nWe have the following corollary by replacing the condition (1) on the edge probability q n with a condition on the asymptotics Xn 2  Yn of q n (formally, q n ∼ Xn \nY n = ln n + (k -1) ln ln n + β n n ,(3)\nthen under X n ≥ 2, it follows that\nlim n→∞ P G(n, X n , Y n ) is k-connected. = lim n→∞ P [ G(n, X n , Y n ) has a minimum degree at least k. ] =      0, if lim n→∞ β n = -∞, 1, if lim n→∞ β n = ∞, e -e -β * (k-1)! , if lim n\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}}
