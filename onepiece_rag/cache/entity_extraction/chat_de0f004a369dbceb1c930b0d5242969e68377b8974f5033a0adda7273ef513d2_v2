For example, given D = {0, 1, 3, 6}, we can get the dimension size of 5 by selecting the third region with 2 embedding blocks and the fourth region with 3 blocks. In contrast, previous methods can only select an embedding size that belongs to D because the regions controlled by different operators are overlapping, and the importance of these coupled operators is not independent of each other.\nùëí ! \" ùëí # \" e $ \" ùëí % \" ùëí & \" ùëí ' \" ùëí ( \" ùëí ) \" ùëí !

Specifically, we introduce a soft layer that assigns varying weights\nŒ± i = Œ± i 1 , ‚Ä¢ ‚Ä¢ ‚Ä¢ , Œ± i K to learn the relative contribution of different embedding regions of field f i . Trainable variables w i = w i 1 , ‚Ä¢ ‚Ä¢ ‚Ä¢ , w i\nK are introduced to calculate the value of each Œ± i j :\nŒ± i j = exp(w i j /œÑ ) K j=1 exp(w i j /œÑ ) , for j = 1, 2, . . . , K,(2)\nwhere œÑ > 0 is the temperature hyperparameter. Note that the magnitude of the values in e i can be different and easily coupled with other parameters in DNN, making it difficult for the architecture parameters Œ± i to represent the relative importance of different embedding regions. Following [36],\n[45], we adopt the batch normalization [46] technique before the embedding transformation to eliminate the scale issue. The normalized embedding e\ni ‚Ä≤ = {e i ‚Ä≤ 1 , ‚Ä¢ ‚Ä¢ ‚Ä¢ , e i ‚Ä≤ d K } is calculated as: e i ‚Ä≤ j = e i j -¬µ i j (B) [œÉ i j (B)] 2 + œµ , for j = 1, 2, . . . , d K ,(3)\nwhere ¬µ i j (B) and œÉ i j (B) are the mean and standard deviation of e i j over a mini-batch B, and œµ is a small positive constant to avoid numerical overflow. With this trick, we can force each value in e i ‚Ä≤ to approximately follow the Gaussian distribution N(0, 1), making them comparable with each other. As illustrated in Figure 3, the transformed embedding e i of field f i can be computed as:\ne i = e i ‚Ä≤ ‚äô K j=1 Œ± i j O i j ,(4)\nwhere e i ‚Ä≤ is the output of the batch normalization layer and ‚äô is the element-wise product.\nBy applying Equation (4) to all fields and feeding all output embedding to the target DNN structure, we can obtain the relative importance of different embedding regions in the target model with a training set. Such an end-to-end importance evaluation mechanism allows the DNN model to softly select different embedding regions during model training, and an ideal subset of fields F ‚äÜ F and the corresponding discrete mixed dimension scheme C A can then be derived after training.<h2>publication_ref</h2>['b16', 'b42', 'b35', 'b45']<h2>figure_ref</h2>[]<h2>table_ref</h2>[]<h2>heading</h2>Loss Function<h2>text</h2>In recommendation tasks, it is common for the number of features in different fields to vary greatly. For example, the field Gender usually has two features, while the field Browsed Goods may have millions of features. Therefore, varying even one embedding dimension on fields like Browsed Goods can lead to a significant change in the embedding lookup table size. In order to balance model performance and memory consumption, inspired by [42], we propose a novel regularization term L p to regularize the number of model parameters:\nL p = N i=1 |f i | N j=1 |f j | √ó K m=1 c m Œ± i m ,(5)\nc m = d 1 , m = 1; d m -d m-1 , otherwise,(6)\nwhere |f i | indicates the number of features contained in field f i and c m represents the size of the embedding region that operator O i m controls.
