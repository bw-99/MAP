The predicted rating is then compared with the real rating and the difference (in absolute value) is the prediction error. The mean absolute error (MAE) is adopted as the performance measure.\nTo reduce variability, we perform 5 rounds of the above operations using different partitions for each algorithm, and the prediction results are averaged over the rounds. For the sake of fairness in comparison, we try different α values and then select the optimal value 0.3 for use for iTrace-III and iTrace-IV.\nThe comparison result, in terms of averaged MAE per rating prediction, is presented in Fig. 4. It is shown that trust based methods outperform the traditional CF significantly and that the iTrace-I algorithm beats all the other competitors. It also indicates that Eqn.( 4) is preferable to Eqn. (5) and Eqn.( 7) is preferable to Eqn. (9) for use in implementing iTrace.
