In particular, Erdős and Rényi [12] showed that if p n = ln n+(k-1) ln ln n+αn n , then G(n, p n ) is asymptotically almost surely k-connected (resp., not k-connected) if lim n→∞ α n = +∞ (resp., lim n→∞ α n = -∞). Similarly, Rybarczyk [33] has shown under some extra conditions (i.e.,\nP n = Θ(n ξ ) with ξ > 1) that if p s = ln n+(k-1) ln ln n+αn n , then G(n, K n , P n ) is almost surely k- connected (resp., not k-connected) if lim n→∞ α n = +∞ (resp., lim n→∞ α n = -∞).\nThe analogy between these two results could be exploited to conjecture similar k-connectivity results for our system model G on . To see this, recall from (3) that\nG on = G(n, K n , P n ) ∩ G(n, p n ).(21)\nSince G(n, K n , P n ) and G(n, p s ) have similar k-connectivity properties, it would seem intuitive to replace G(n, K n , P n ) with G(n, p s ) in the above equation (21). Then, using we would automatically obtain Theorem 1 via the aforementioned results of Erdős and Rényi [12]. Unfortunately, such heuristic approaches can not be taken for granted as G(n, K n , P n ) = G(n, p s ) in general. For instance, the two graphs are shown [38], [40] to exhibit quite different characteristics in terms of properties including clustering coefficient, number of triangles, etc. To this end, Theorem 1 formally validates the above intuition for the k-connectivity property, and it is worth mentioning that we establish Theorem 1 with a direct proof that does not rely on coupling arguments between random key graph and ER graph.\nG on ≃ G(n, p s ) ∩ G(n, p n ) = G(n, p n p s ) = G(n, p e ),\nWe now compare our results with those of Rybarczyk [33] for the k-connectivity of random key graph G(n, K n , P n ). As already noted, Rybarczyk [33, Remark 1, p. 5] has established an analog of Corollary 2, but under assumptions much stronger than ours. In particular, her result requires that P n = Θ(n ξ ) where ξ > 1. In comparison, Corollary 2 established here enforces only that P n ≥ Ω(n), which is clearly a much weaker condition than P n = Θ(n ξ ) with ξ > 1. More importantly, our condition P n ≥ Ω(n) requires (from (20)) only that K n = Ω( √ ln n) for the one-law to hold; i.e., for G on to be k-connected. However, the condition P n = Θ(n ξ ) with ξ > 1 enforced in [33] requires the key ring sizes to satisfy K n = Ω( √ n ξ-1 ln n) with ξ -1 > 0. This condition not only constitutes a much stronger requirement than K n = Ω( √ ln n), but it also renders the k-connectivity result given in [33] not applicable in the context of WSNs. This is because K n controls the number of keys kept in each sensor's memory, and should be very small [13] due to limited memory and computational capability of sensor nodes; in general K n = O(ln n) is accepted [9] as a reasonable bound on the key ring sizes.\nFinally, we compare Theorem 1 with the zero-one law given by Yagan [37] for the 1-connectivity of G on . As mentioned in Section II above, he shows that if\np e ∼ c ln n n = ln n + (c -1) ln n n(22)\nthen G on is a.a.s. connected if c > 1, and it is a.a.s. not connected if c < 1. This was done under the additional \nG o n is k-connected p = 0.2 k = 4 k = 6 k = 8 k = 10\nFig. 2. Empirical probability that Gon(n, K, P, p) is k-connected for k = 4, 6, 8, and 10.

Vertical dashed lines stand for the critical threshold of k-connectivity asserted by Theorem 1.\nconditions that P n = Ω(n) (required only for the one-law) and that lim n→∞ p n ln n exists (required only for the zerolaw). On the other hand, Theorem 1 given here establishes (by setting k = 1) that, if\np e = ln n + α n n(23)\nthen G on is a.a.s. connected if lim n→∞ α n = ∞, and it is a.a.s. not connected if lim n→\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}}
