With this objective, we propose a differentiable framework that identifies redundantly assigned embedding dimensions for pruning. Specifically, a feature with its embedding dimension pruned to 0 is considered unimportant. It is worth noting that features are typically grouped into fields for practical reasons in industrial recommender systems, and these fields can 1. Field-level methods assign the same dimension to all features within the same field while feature-level ones can assign diverse dimensions to different features within the same field.\nhave significantly varying cardinalities. For example, the field Gender generally contains two features \"Female\" and \"Male\", while the field Browsed Goods may have millions of features. While individual dimension assignment for each feature (i.e., feature-level methods) might boost performance, field selection and field-level dimension search are often prioritized in large-scale recommender systems to reduce complexity and enhance implementation ease. This paper emphasizes assigning different dimension sizes to fields based on their importance, and discarding less important fields during the retraining stage. Unless otherwise specified, the term \"feature selection\" hereafter refers to the selection of fields.\nTo guide the input configuration towards better optima, we propose a differentiable neural input razor (i-Razor) that is capable of simultaneously pruning unnecessary fields and assigning adaptive embedding dimensions. The training of i-Razor consists of two stages. i) In the pretraining stage, we refine the dimension search space to learn the importance of different fields and different embedding regions. Meanwhile, to control the number of model parameters and avoid overfitting, we introduce a novel regularization term to regularize the model complexity. ii) In the retraining stage, a proposed pruning algorithm is executed to remove redundant fields and preserve the desired embedding dimensions for the remaining fields according to the relative weights of each embedding region. We then reconstruct the DNN model and retrain it with the training dataset based on the derived input configuration. We conduct extensive experiments on two large-scale public datasets for the CTR prediction task. The experimental results show that i-Razor achieves higher prediction accuracy while saving fields than several state-ofthe-art methods.\nThe main contributions of this paper are threefold. ‚Ä¢ Traditionally, feature selection and embedding dimension search were treated as separate processes. Our research presents a pioneering approach that explores their joint optimization. This innovative leap not only bridges the gap between feature selection and dimension search but also hints at a higher level of alignment between the two, which has the potential to discover input configurations that more closely approach optimal solutions. The remainder of this paper is organized as follows: Section 2 discusses the related literature on feature selection and embedding dimension search. We formulate the input configuration optimization problem and present the framework of i-Razor in Section 3. In Section 4, we elaborate on our experimental setup and empirical results. Finally, we conclude our work and discuss its potential future extensions in Section 5. </p><h2>publication_ref</h2> <p>['b0', 'b1', 'b2', 'b3', 'b4', 'b3', 'b5', 'b6', 'b7', 'b8', 'b9', 'b10', 'b11', 'b12', 'b13', 'b14', 'b15', 'b8', 'b6', 'b16', 'b17', 'b18', 'b19', 'b20'] </p><h2>figure_ref</h2> <p>['fig_0'] </p><h2>table_ref</h2> <p>[] </p><h2>heading</h2> <p>RELATED WORK </p><h2>text</h2> <p>In this section, we briefly review the works related to our study, including two branches of the literature: feature selection approaches and dimension search techniques. </p><h2>publication_ref</h2> <p>[] </p><h2>figure_ref</h2> <p>[] </p><h2>table_ref</h2> <p>[] </p><h2>heading</h2> <p>Feature Selection Approaches </p><h2>text</h2> <p>Feature selection refers to the process of finding out a subset from the original feature set without losing useful information [22]. Existing feature selection methods include the following three categories: Filter, Wrapper, and Embedded methods [23]. Filter methods measure the association between the feature and the class label via some specific evaluation criteria [22], such as information gain [24], minimum redundant maximum relevance [25], and spatiotemporal preserving representations [26]. This stream of research also includes feature selection methods based on statistical tests, e.g., Chi-squared [27], Pearson correlation, and ANOVA F-value test [28]. Input features that demonstrate a significant statistical relationship with the output variable are retained and utilized for further analysis, while others are discarded. Filter methods are expected to have the highest computational efficiency and tend to keep more features from the total feature space [9], [10]. By contrast, Wrapper methods adopt specific learning techniques such as KNN [29], Naive Bayes [30], LDA [31], and adaptive semisupervised feature analysis [32] to assess the performance of feature combinations [13]. Though more efficient for feature selection than Filter methods, Wrapper methods require higher computational resources [33]. In these two types of feature selection methods, the feature selection process and the model training process are distinctly separate.\nUnlike Filter and Wrapper methods, Embedded methods such as LASSO [14], GBDT [15], and semi-supervised recurrent convolutional attention models [34] integrate the feature selection process with the model training process, i\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}}
