We consider a plausible patch to be overfitted to the test suite (1) Among the 23(= 44 -21) plausible patches that are generated based on IRFL identified code locations and that are not found to be correct, 6 are found to be caused by fault localization errors: these bugs are plausibly fixed by mutating irrelevantlysuspicious statements that are placed before the actual buggy statements in the fault localization output list. This phenomenon has been recently investigated in the literature as the problem of fault localization bias [48]. Nevertheless, we note that patches generated based on SBFL identified code locations suffer more of fault localization bias: 15 of the 26 (= 50-24) plausible patches are concerned by this issue. (2) Pattern prioritization failures may also lead to plausible patches: while a correct patch could have been generated using a specific pattern at a lower node in the AST, another pattern (leading to an only plausible patch) was first found to be matching the statement during the iterative search of matching nodes (cf. Section 3.3). ( 3) Finally, we note that both configurations yield plausible patches due to the lack of suitable patterns or due to a failed search for the adequate donor code (i.e., fix ingredient [44]).\nExperiments with the Defects4J dataset suggest that code locations provided by IR-based fault localization lead less to overfitted patches than the code locations suggested by Spectrum-based fault localization: cf. \"Localization error\" column in Table 8.<h2>publication_ref</h2>['b47', 'b43']<h2>figure_ref</h2>[]<h2>table_ref</h2>[]<h2>heading</h2>RQ3: [Patch Ordering]<h2>text</h2>While the previous experiment focused on patch generation, our final experiment assesses the complete pipeline of iFixR as it was imagined for meeting the constraints that developers can face in practice: future test cases, i.e., those which encode the functionality requirements that are not met by the buggy programs, may not be available at the time the bug is reported. We thus discard the future test cases of the Defects4J dataset and generate patches that must be recommended to developers. The evaluation protocol thus consists in assessing to what extent correct/plausible patches are placed in the top of the recommendation list.<h2>publication_ref</h2>[]<h2>figure_ref</h2>[]<h2>table_ref</h2>[]<h2>heading</h2>5.<h2>text</h2>3.1 Overall performance. Table 9 details the performance of the patch recommendation by iFixR: we present the number of bugs for which a correct/plausible patch is generated and presented among the top-k of the list of recommended patches. In the absence of future test cases to drive the patch validation process, we use heuristics (cf. Section 4.2) to re-prioritize the patch candidates towards ensuring that patches which are recommended first will eventually be correct (or at least plausible when relevant test cases are implemented). We present results both for the case where we do not re-prioritize and the case where we re-prioritize.\nRecall that, given that the re-organized benchmark separately includes the future test cases, we can leverage them to systematize the assessment of patch plausibility. The correctness (also referred to as correctness [69]) of patches, however, is still decided manually by comparing against the actual bug fix provided by developers and available in the benchmark. Overall, we note that iFixR performance is promising as it manages, for 13 bugs, to present a plausible patch among its top-5 recommended patches per bug. Among those plausible patches, 8 are eventually found to be correct.  [19] which uses sophisticated techniques to improve the fault localization accuracy and search for fix ingredients. It should be noted that in this case, our prioritization strategy is not applied to the generated patches. iFixR opt represents the reference performance for our experiment which assesses the prioritization. Table 10 provides the comparison matrix. Information on stateof-the-art results are excerpted from their respective publications.\niFixR offers a reasonable performance in patch recommendation when we consider the number of Defects4J bugs that are successfully patched among the top-5 (in a scenario where we assume not having relevant test cases to validate the patch candidates). Performance results are even comparable to many state-of-the-art test-based APR tools in the literature.<h2>publication_ref</h2>['b68', 'b18']<h2>figure_ref</h2>[]<h2>table_ref</h2>['tab_11', 'tab_12']<h2>heading</h2>5.3.3<h2>text</h2>Properties of iFixR's patches.
