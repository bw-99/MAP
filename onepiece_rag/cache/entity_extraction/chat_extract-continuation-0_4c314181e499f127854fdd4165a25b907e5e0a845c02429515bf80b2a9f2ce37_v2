Intuitively xRy means that x is preferable to y. The case xRy and not yRx means that x is strictly preferable to y. This situation is denoted by xR * y. We also consider a positive and σ-finite measure µ [Halmos, 2013] defined on X. Thus, we have a measure space (X, Σ, µ), where Σ is a set of subsets of X, and µ intuitively indicates the size of these subsets. To ensure measurability, throughout this text the characteristic function 1 R of the relation R is assumed to be sufficiently regular 5 . The µ can be defined in different ways. Important examples are the counting measure and probability measures P . Depending on the definition of µ, it can indicate the following characteristics of the elements in X: how many?, how likely?, how important?, or what volume?\nTo illustrate these definitions, we consider the following example. Let X be a set of possible habitations of which the user has to choose the best according to his preferences encoded by the relation R. In such a situation, the relation R can be multidimensional. Let us assume, for simplicity, that an optimal habitation for the user is close to a given location, for example, his workplace (relation R l ), is situated in a district with a smaller population size (relation R p ), and is close to a river (relation R r ). Thus, the user's preferences can be represented by the preorder relation R = R l &R p &R r . In our example, all available habitations from X can be mapped onto points in a 3dimensional space of Proximity to the location × Population × River. The fact that R is a preorder rela-5 1R is equal to 1 if xRy and is equal to 0 otherwise.\ntion means that some elements of X can be comparable, while others not. For example, the habitation x with coordinates (50, 100, T rue) is strictly preferable to y with coordinates (60, 100, T rue), that is xR * y.\nAt the same time, the habitation z with coordinates (40, 100, F alse) is incomparable with x. Indeed, z is better with respect to R l , it is situated closer to the required location, but x is better with respect to R r , as the latter is situated near a river.\nHaving the task to find a subset of X that is 'best' according to R, a rational solution can be formulated with the following recursive expression: if an element x is selected, then all elements that are strictly preferable to x should be also selected. In our example, this translates into the task of finding a subset of habitations S R that might be suitable for the user. Naturally, if y ∈ S R , then x ∈ S R as the latter corresponds better to the preferences of the user defined by the relation R. We formalize this rationality condition by defining selections as follows.\nDefinition 1. A selection S is a subset of X such that x ∈ S and yR * x implies y ∈ S. The set of all selections in Σ is denoted by Sfoot_2 . </p><h2>publication_ref</h2> <p>[] </p><h2>figure_ref</h2> <p>[] </p><h2>table_ref</h2> <p>[] </p><h2>heading</h2> <p>The Maximum Choice Problem </p><h2>text</h2> <p>As discussed in Section 1, in practical applications when selecting a subset of X one might want not only to respect the above rationality constraint, but also to maximize the number of incomparable pairs. The latter condition is equivalent to the maximization of the diversity of the selected subset, or the maximization of the provided choice. In our example with habitations, if both x and z are presented to the user, then he can choose an appropriate habitation by himselffoot_3 .\nIn terms of our notations, this will be translated into the condition of selecting as many pairs x, y such that neither x is strictly preferable to y (¬xR * y) nor y is strictly preferable to x (¬yR * x). This means that there is freedom of choice between x and y (xRy = yRx). This motivates the following quantitative definition of choice for measurable subsets of X.\nDefinition 2. Choice offered by a set A is the number\ncho(A) = (µ × µ)({(x, y) ∈ A 2 |xRy = yRx}).\nThe choice offered by a measurable set A essentially measures how many pairs of items offering choice can be extracted from A. Additionally, if one wants to restrict the size of the selected subset, in our example, to present to the user a small set of suitable habitations with µ(S R ) ≤ m, then this leads us to the definition of the maximum choice problem: Maximum Choice Problem. For a given m find all selections T such that cho(T ) = max S∈S,µ(S)≤m cho(S).\nAny such selection T will be said to offer maximum choice for m.\nIn practical applications, it might be more insightful to consider the concept of diversity that is functionally related to the concept of choice. Definition 3. For any measurable set A, the diversity of A is the ratio div(A) = cho(A)/µ(A) 2 .\nThus div(A) is the likelihood that there is choice between the two randomly chosen elements. The main ingredient of our solution to the maximum choice problem is the following concept. Definition 4.
