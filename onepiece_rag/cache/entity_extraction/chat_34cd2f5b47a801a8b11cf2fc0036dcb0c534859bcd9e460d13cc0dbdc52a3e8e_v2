The details are presented in Algorithm 1. The intuition behind this is that embedding regions with higher weights contain more effective information and should be retained in preference during pruning.\nRecall that d fi = 0 means that the corresponding field f i is useless and thus can be removed in the retraining stage. By applying Algorithm 1 to each field separately, we simultaneously complete feature selection and dimension search to obtain the pruned neural architecture of the retraining model. Compared with those selection algorithms based on the argmax operator, the proposed CPT-based pruning algorithm can generate more fine-grained embedding dimension configurations. Meanwhile, our algorithm can cover some common embedding search methods by flexibly adjusting the threshold. For example, the argmax operator in DART-style work [17], [19] becomes a special case with cpt = 0, while cpt = 1 means retaining all regions. </p><h2>publication_ref</h2> <p>['b16', 'b18', 'b16', 'b18'] </p><h2>figure_ref</h2> <p>[] </p><h2>table_ref</h2> <p>[] </p><h2>heading</h2> <p>Model Retraining </p><h2>text</h2> <p>As shown in Figure 2, we discard useless fields and redundant dimensions to redefine the architecture of the retraining model. Specifically, we only allocate embedding dimensions to fields in F according to C A and concatenate all of these dimensions to feed into the subsequent DNN model. Note that as the dimension size of the embedding layer changes, the first layer of the DNN model needs to be adjusted accordingly. In addition, batch normalization is not used during retraining since there are no comparisons between different operators in each field. All parameters in the retraining model will be trained on the training set T by only minimizing the cross-entropy loss. </p><h2>publication_ref</h2> <p>[] </p><h2>figure_ref</h2> <p>['fig_1'] </p><h2>table_ref</h2> <p>[] </p><h2>heading</h2> <p>Complexity Analysis and Discussion </p><h2>text</h2> <p>Similar to FM-style approaches [47], [48], [49], the space complexity of i-Razor is near O(nd K ), where n is the total number of features contained in all N fields and d K is the largest candidate dimension in the search space. In terms of training speed, the continuous relaxation and embedding transformation in i-Razor has a complexity of O(N Kd K ), which slows down the training when setting up candidates of large embedding dimensions. Overall, the proposed i-Razor elegantly converts the joint optimization of feature selection and dimension search into an operator selection process, which improves the flexibility and interpretability of feature engineering, while goes beyond the convention of \"feature selection before dimension search\". Given a suitable search space, i-Razor is efficient and conforms to the demand of recommendation scenarios. </p><h2>publication_ref</h2> <p>['b46', 'b47', 'b48'] </p><h2>figure_ref</h2> <p>[] </p><h2>table_ref</h2> <p>[] </p><h2>heading</h2> <p>EXPERIMENTS </p><h2>text</h2> <p>Extensive experiments were conducted on two well-known public datasets to answer the following research questions:\n• RQ1: How does i-Razor perform when compared to other input search methods? • RQ2: How do key components, i.e., the setting of d 1 = 0 and the CPT-based pruning algorithm, affect the performance? • RQ3: How do different hyperparameters affect i-Razor?\n• RQ4: How does the search space setting affect i-Razor?\n• RQ5: What is the interpretability of i-Razor?\n• RQ6: What is the compatibility of i-Razor with various deep recommendation models, and can the learned configurations from one model serve as a valuable reference for others on the same dataset? </p><h2>publication_ref</h2> <p>[] </p><h2>figure_ref</h2> <p>[] </p><h2>table_ref</h2> <p>[] </p><h2>heading</h2> <p>Datasets </p><h2>text</h2> <p>Experiments were conducted on the following two public datasets:\n• Criteo 2 : Criteo is a benchmark industry dataset, which contains one month of click logs. In our experiments, we use \"data 6-12\" as the training set while selecting \"day 13\" for evaluation. Due to the huge volume of data and the severe label imbalance (only 3% positive samples), negative down-sampling is applied to keep the positive ratio roughly at 50%. • Avazu 3 : Avazu dataset was provided for the CTR prediction challenge on Kaggle. 80% of randomly shuffled data is allotted for training and validation while the rest 20% for testing.\nTo make a fair comparison between different methods, we process the two datasets following the settings 4 in AutoFIS [36] and PIN [45]. Meanwhile, to demonstrate the capability of feature selection from noisy fields, we augment the number of fields in the two datasets by brute-forcing all cross fields, yielding 39 + C 2 39 = 780\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}}
