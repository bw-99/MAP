There are several observations:\n‚Ä¢ Proper feature selection leads to competitive or even superior performance compared with FDE. This indicates that filtering out less informative and predictive features is beneficial for recommendation models. Additionally, we observe that the discarded fields have a small cardinality (i.e., a small number of features per field) on Avazu, which limits the savings in Params. This emphasizes the importance of further exploring dimension search techniques. ‚Ä¢ Comparing all dimension search methods with FDE, we observe that dimension search methods generally achieve more significant parameter savings. However, on Criteo, existing dimension search methods assign dimensions to each field, which fails to eliminate the Feature selection eliminates less informative features without compromising model performance, while dimension search effectively reduces parameter quantities. The findings emphasize the importance of integrating these optimization processes, as evidenced by the superior performance of i-Razor compared to other methods. </p><h2>publication_ref</h2> <p>[] </p><h2>figure_ref</h2> <p>[] </p><h2>table_ref</h2> <p>['tab_6', 'tab_7'] </p><h2>heading</h2> <p>Ablation Study (RQ2) </p><h2>text</h2> <p>In i-Razor, the introduced dimension 0 in the search space plays an important role to filter out the useless fields. Meanwhile, the proposed CPT-based pruning algorithm makes it easy and flexible to derive the desired embedding configuration. To further study the role of these two components, we propose and compare the following four variants:\n1) 'i-Razor w/ 0': using the CPT-based pruning algorithm while introducing dimension 0 into the search space; 2) 'i-Razor w/o 0': only using the CPT-based pruning algorithm; 3) 'argmax w/ 0': using the argmax selector while introducing dimension 0 into the search space; 4) 'argmax w/o 0': only using the argmax selector.\nTo be specific, we consider two kinds of candidate dimension sets, i.e., D 1 = 0, 1, 3, 6, 10 and D 2 = 1, 3, 6, 10.\nThe best results of these variants on Criteo-FG and Avazu-FG are shown in Table 5 and we draw the following conclusions:\n‚Ä¢ By comparing variant (1) with ( 2) and comparing variant (3) with ( 4), we observe that the variants with dimension 0 (w/ 0) consistently outperform those without dimension 0 (w/o 0). The reason is that the introduced dimension 0 can increase the distinction between different fields and avoid assigning dimensions to redundant fields. This observation suggests that the introduction of dimension 0 can benefit recommender systems where noisy and redundant fields exist, especially in the face of thousands of fields in large-scale industrial recommender systems. ‚Ä¢ By comparing variant (1) with (3) and comparing variant\n(2) with ( 4), we observe that the CPT-based pruning algorithm can achieve a performance gain at the expense of preserving more fields and parameters. Recall that the argmax-based pruning algorithm is a special case of the CPT-based pruning algorithm (by setting cpt = 0), we conclude that the CPT-based pruning algorithm is more suitable for real-world recommender systems due to its flexibility to obtain effective coordination between model performance and memory overhead. In summary, both components have their advantages, such as dimension 0 contributes to feature selection and parameter reduction, while the CPT-based pruning algorithm further helps the model to arrive at better input configurations. </p><h2>publication_ref</h2> <p>[] </p><h2>figure_ref</h2> <p>[] </p><h2>table_ref</h2> <p>['tab_8'] </p><h2>heading</h2> <p>Hyperparameter Study (RQ3) </p><h2>text</h2> <p>There are two main hyperparameters involved in i-Razor: the threshold cpt and the weight coefficient Œª of the regularization term L p .

As shown in Figure 4, larger cpt leads to larger value of Params, which is straightforward as more embedding regions and fields would be retained.
