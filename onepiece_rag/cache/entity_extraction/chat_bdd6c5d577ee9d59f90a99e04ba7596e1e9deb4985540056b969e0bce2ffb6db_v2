The detailed optimization strategy in each stage is illustrated in Algorithm 1. [35], the use of Gumbel-Softmax approximation for the discrete random variable suffers from high variance, which can lead to inconsistency in the set of selected dimensions. Inspired by [15], we first pretrain the base recommender model for a few epochs to obtain a tentative reliable embedding representation. During these pretrain epochs, the Bernoulli gates are always deterministically open (no matter what embedding representation it receives). Then, after we've obtained a tentative reliable embedding representation, we initialize the parameters for the Bernoulli gates and start the stochastic selection. Later we adopt the bi-level optimization strategy [12,24] to disjointly update the parameters 𝒘 in Bernoulli gates and the parameters 𝑽, 𝜽  b in the base recommender model. </p><h2>publication_ref</h2> <p>['b11', 'b14', 'b23', 'b32', 'b34', 'b14', 'b11', 'b23'] </p><h2>figure_ref</h2> <p>[] </p><h2>table_ref</h2> <p>[] </p><h2>heading</h2> <p>Searching Stage.
