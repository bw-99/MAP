Blackburn and Gerke [2] prove that if K n ≥ 2 and P n = ⌊n ξ ⌋, where ξ is a positive constant, G(n, K n , P n ) is a.a.s. connected (resp., not connected) if lim inf n→+∞\nK 2 n n Pn ln n > 1 (resp., lim sup n→+∞ K 2 n n\nPn ln n < 1). Yagan and Makowski [39] demonstrate that iffoot_0 K n ≥ 2, P n = Ω(n) and\nK 2 n Pn = ln n+αn n , then G(n, K n , P n ) is a.a.s. connected (resp., not connected) if lim n→∞ α n = +∞ (resp., lim n→∞ α n = -∞).\nRybarczyk [32] obtains a stronger result without requiring P n = Ω(n). In particular, she derives the asymptotically exact probability of connectivity in G(n, K n , P n ) as follows: under K n ≥ 2, if the sequence α n defined through\nK 2 n Pn = ln n+αn n has a limit α * ∈ [-∞, ∞], then the probability of G(n, K n , P n ) being connected approaches to e -e -α *\nas n → ∞. This asymptotically exact probability result is stronger than a zeroone law since the latter can be obtained by setting α * as ∞ and -∞ in the former. Rybarczyk also establishes [33, Remark 1, p. 5] a zero-one law for k-connectivity in G(n, K n , P n ) by showing the similarity between G(n, K n , P n ) and a random intersection graph [5] via a coupling argument. Specifically, she proves that if P n = Θ(n ξ ) for some ξ > 1 and\nK 2 n Pn = ln n+(k-1) ln ln n+αn n , then the G(n, K n , P n ) is a.a.s. k-connected (resp., not k-connected) if lim n→∞ α n = +∞ (resp., lim n→∞ α n = -∞).\nRecently Yagan [37] gives a zero-one law for connectivity (i.e., 1-connectivity) in graph G(n, K n , P n )∩G(n, p n ), which is the intersection of random key graph G(n, K n , P n ) and random graph G(n, p n ), and clearly is equivalent to our key graph G on ; see Section III. Specifically, he proves that if\nK n ≥ 2, P n = Ω(n) and p n • 1 - ( Pn -Kn Kn ) ( Pn Kn )\n∼ c ln n n hold, and lim n→∞ (p n ln n) exists, then graph G(n, K n , P n ) ∩ G(n, p n ) is asymptotically almost surely connected (resp., not connected) if c > 1 (resp., c < 1). A comparison of our results with the related work is given in Section IV-D.\nAfter the submission of this paper, we have derived the asymptotically exact probability of k-connectivity in G(n, K n , P n ) [45] (resp., G on [44]). Based on the proofs in this paper, we show i) that [45] under P n = Ω(n), if the sequence α n defined through\nK 2 n Pn = ln n+(k-1) ln ln n+αn n has a limit α * ∈ [-∞, ∞], then the probability of G(n, K n , P n ) being k-connected converges to e -e -α *\n(k-1)! as n → ∞, and ii) that [44] under P n = Ω(n) and Kn Pn = o(1), if the sequence\nα n defined through p n • 1 - ( Pn -Kn Kn ) ( Pn Kn ) = ln n+(k-1) ln ln n+αn n has a limit α * ∈ [-∞, ∞],\nthen the probability of G on being k-connected converges to e -e -α * (k-1)! as n → ∞. </p><h2>publication_ref</h2> <p>['b10', 'b15', 'b10', 'b11', 'b29', 'b1', 'b31', 'b38', 'b1', 'b38', 'b31', 'b4', 'b36', 'b44', 'b43', 'b44', 'b43'] </p><h2>figure_ref</h2> <p>[] </p><h2>table_ref</h2> <p>[] </p><h2>heading</h2> <p>III.
