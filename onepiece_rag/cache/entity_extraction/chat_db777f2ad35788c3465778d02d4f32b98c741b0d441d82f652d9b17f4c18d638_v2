Converting a bug report to a patch. \"-\" denotes a line to be deleted; \"+\" denotes a line to be added; and \" \" is one space character.\ndevelopers forget to check if the array is long enough to hold the content before the assignment; or was the bug caused by more complex reasons? The developers then need to check out the buggy version, modify the buggy code to fix the bug, and generate the patch that can be applied to the shared source code repository. The result of this challenging and time-consuming process by developers for bug 11975 is the patch in Figure 1(b). The patch deletes the line that writes 5 bytes to buffer state (denoted by -strcpy(state, \"off \");), and adds a new line to write only 4 bytes to state (+ strcpy(state, \"off\");), which fixes the overflow bug.\nDevelopers often need to fix more bugs than their time and resources allow [6]. Although developers spend almost half of their time fixing bugs [21], bugs take years to be fixed on average [9], [19].\nTherefore, support to make it easier and faster for developers to fix bugs is in high demand. The capability to automatically generate patches (e.g., Figure 1(b)) from bug reports (e.g., Figure 1(a)) could: (1) save programmers' time and effort in diagnosing bugs and generating patches, allowing developers to fix more bugs or focus on other development tasks; and (2) shorten the bug-fixing time, thus improve software reliability and security. </p><h2>publication_ref</h2> <p>['b5', 'b20', 'b8', 'b18', 'b0'] </p><h2>figure_ref</h2> <p>['fig_1', 'fig_1', 'fig_1', 'fig_1'] </p><h2>table_ref</h2> <p>[] </p><h2>heading</h2> <p>A. Ideal Goal Versus Realistic Goal </p><h2>text</h2> <p>Ideally, we want to automatically generate patches for all bug reports. Realistically, it is impossible. We found that only 16.7-33.5% of bug reports in the Linux kernel, Mozilla, and Apache bug databases are fixed. This is because, many bug reports are invalid, unreproducible, incomplete, etc. Even among bugs that can be fixed, some are too complex to be fixed automatically because they require redesign of the algorithm, addition of new features, etc.  (1) which explicitly include localization information, (2) where the symptom (e.g., buffer overrun) is explicitly indicated by the reporter, and ( 3) which are about one of the following three simple bug types: Buffer overflow, Null Pointer dereference or memory leak. R2Fix runs a straightforward classification to identify the bug category and uses a match and transform engine (e.g., Coccinelle [66]) to generate patches. As the authors admitted, their target space represents <1% of bug reports in their dataset. Furthermore, it should be noted that, given the limited scope of the changes implemented in its fix patterns, R2Fix does not need to run tests for verifying that the generated patches do not break any functionality.\nThis paper. We propose to investigate the feasibility of a program repair system driven by bug reports, thus we replace classical spectrum-based fault localization with Information Retrieval (IR)-based fault localization. Eventually, we propose iFixR, a new program repair workflow which considers a practical repair setup by imitating the fundamental steps of manual debugging. iFixR works under the following constraint:\nWhen a bug report is submitted to the issue tracking system, a relevant test case reproducing the bug may not be readily available.\nTherefore, iFixR is leveraged in this study to assess to what extent an APR pipeline is feasible under the practical constraint of limited test suites. iFixR uses bug reports written in natural language as the main input. Eventually, we make the following contributions:\n• We present the architecture of a program repair system adapted to the constraints of maintainers dealing with user-reported bugs.\nIn particular, iFixR replaces classical spectrum-based fault localization with Information Retrieval (IR)-based fault localization. • We propose a strategy to prioritize patches for recommendation to developers. Indeed, given that we assume only the presence of regression test cases to validate patch candidates, many of these patches may fail on the future test cases that are relevant to the\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}}
