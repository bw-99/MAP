We specify perturbations and heterogeneous cellular responses as multivariate Gaussiandistributed variables e ∼ N (µ ke , Σ ke ) and h ∼ N (µ km , Σ km ), respectively. We model perturbation as a dynamic system, where the cell outputs an impulse response function h, when presented with a brief perturbation signal e. The convolution of these variables represents the combined effect on the latent state z pi , which is also distributed as a multivariate Gaussian:\nz pi = (e k * h k )(z) = +∞ -∞ e k (τ )h k (z-τ )dτ ∼ N (µ ke +µ km , Σ ke +Σ km ) ∼ N (µ kp , Σ kp ),(1)\nIn the proposed generative mixture model, the joint probability distribution for observed data X, and latent variables Z i , E, and H conditioned on π, µ, Σ is formulated as:\np(X, Z i , E, H | π, µ, Σ) = N i=1 p(z i |π)p(x proj,i |z i , µ, Σ) N i=1 e * h (2) = N i=1 K k=1 π z ik k N (w bi ; µ k b , Σ k b ) z ik N (w pi ; µ kp , Σ kp ) ,(3)\nwhere Z ∈ {0, 1} N ×K denotes latent class indicators for N cells across K cell states, E ∈ R N ×m captures perturbation effects, and H ∈ R N ×m represents the cellular responses to these perturbations. Each datum w bi , w pi ∈ R m is drawn independently and identically distributed (i.i.d.) from their respective marginal PDFs. To prevent numerical instability due to arithmetic underflow or overflow during likelihood calculations in the E-step of the Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm, we use the log-sum-exp trick. This method transforms the product of Gaussian probabilities into a sum, ensuring more stable computations. Let L denote p(X,\nZ i , E, H | π, µ, Σ): log L = N i=1 K k=1 z ik log π k + z ik log N (w bi ; µ k b , Σ k b ) + log N (w pi ; µ kp , Σ kp )(4)\nThe Maximum-a-Posteriori (MAP) parameter updates for the GMM via the EM algorithm are detailed in Algorithm 3. To address numerical instability in Σ's inversion due to its near singularity or nonpositive semi-definiteness, Tikhonov regularization is applied Alberti et al. (2021).

(2023). A breakthrough by Cuturi (2013) introduces entropic regularization into OT, resulting in the Sinkhorn algorithm, which significantly reduces computational complexity, enabling efficient largescale applications. This methodological advancement, detailed in Section A.2.3, represents a pivotal shift towards practical OT computation in machine learning. While OT is conventionally represented by a scalar value indicating the minimum cost required for such transport under specific constraints, sc-OTGM conceptualizes OT as a distribution to focus on the distribution of transportation costs and paths rather than summarizing these costs into a single scalar. A distribution-based approach encapsulates more information about the transport process, such as the variance of transport costs, providing not just the minimum cost but also how costs are distributed across different transport paths. Additionally, it provides a more robust measure of similarity between distributions, as it does not collapse the transport problem into a single metric but rather considers the entire cost landscape, potentially mitigating the influence of outliers.\nWe model the latent states of unperturbed and perturbed cells as Gaussian distributions, with unperturbed cells described by X = N (µ k b , Σ k b ) and perturbed cells by Y = N (µ ky , Σ ky ). MAP estimates for µ k b , Σ k b , µ ky , Σ ky were derived using the EM Algorithm within a GMM framework.\nTo quantify the perturbation effect, we introduce a distribution, Z = N (µ kp , Σ kp ), resulting from the linear displacement between X and Y . Specifically, Z is characterized by\nµ kp = µ ky -µ k b and Σ kp = Σ k b + Σ ky -2Σ cross .\nZ captures the OT cost distribution required to transition between these states. The coupling (joint distribution) of X and Y is unknown, therefore we approximate Σ cross via Hit-and-Run Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC). This generates a Markov chain that, in its stable state, converges to the uniform distribution over a convex polytope van Valkenhoef & Tervonen (2015), and under certain regularity\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}}
