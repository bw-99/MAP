For a random key graph G(n, X n , Y n ) under ( 1) and X n ≥ 2, it follows for integers m ≥ 1 and h ≥ 0 that\nP[Nodes v 1 , v 2 , . . . , v m have degree h] ∼ (h!) -m (nq n ) hm e -mnqn .(5)\nWe detail the proof of Lemma 3 in the next section. </p><h2>publication_ref</h2> <p>['b1', 'b10'] </p><h2>figure_ref</h2> <p>[] </p><h2>table_ref</h2> <p>[] </p><h2>heading</h2> <p>III. THE PROOF OF LEMMA 3 </p><h2>text</h2> <p>In a random key graph G(n, X n , Y n ), recalling that V = {v 1 , v 2 , . . . , v n } is the set of nodes, we let S i be the set of X n distinct objects assigned to node v i ∈ V. We further define V m as {v 1 , v 2 , . . . , v m } and V m as V \\ V m . Among nodes in V m , we denote by N i the set of nodes neighboring to v i for i = 1, 2, . . . , m. We denote N i ∩ N j by N ij , and S i ∩ S j by S ij .\nWe \n(S ij = ∅) happens. ii) If |N i | ≤ h for any i = 1, 2, . . . , m, then 1≤i≤m N i ≤ 1≤i≤m N i ≤ hm,(6)\nwhere the two equal signs in ( 6) both hold if and only if\n1≤i<j≤m (N ij = ∅) ∩ 1≤i≤m (|N i | = h) .(7)\nFrom i) and ii) above, if nodes v 1 , v 2 , . . . , v m have degree h, we have either of the following two cases: (a) Any two of v 1 , v 2 , . . . , v m have no edge in between (namely, 1≤i<j≤m (S ij = ∅)); and event (7) happens. </p><h2>publication_ref</h2> <p>[] </p><h2>figure_ref</h2> <p>[] </p><h2>table_ref</h2> <p>[] </p><h2>heading</h2> <p>(b) </p><h2>text</h2> <p>1≤i≤m N i ≤ hm -1. In addition, if case (a) happens, then nodes v 1 , v 2 , . . . , v m have degree h. However, if case (b) occurs, there is no such conclusion. With P a (resp., P b ) denoting the probability of case (a) (resp., case (b)), we obtain\nP a ≤ P[Nodes v 1 , v 2 , . . . , v m have degree h] ≤ P a + P b ,\nwhere\nP a = P 1≤i<j≤m (S ij = ∅) ∩ 1≤i<j≤m (N ij = ∅) ∩ 1≤i≤m (|N i | = h) ,\nand\nP b = P 1≤i≤m N i ≤ hm -1 .\nHence, (5) holds after we prove the following ( 8) and ( 9):\nP b = o (nq n ) hm e -mnqn .(8)\nand\nP a ∼ (h!) -m (nq n ) hm e -mnqn • [1 + o(1)],(9)\nWe will prove ( 8) and ( 9) below. We let S m denote the tuple (S \n:= S * i ∩ S * j .\nFor two different nodes v and w in the graph G(n, X n , Y n ), we use v ↔ w to denote the event that there is an edge between v and w; i.e., the symbol \"↔\" means \"is directly connected to\".\nA. The Proof of (8) Let w be an arbitrary node in V m . We have\nP 1≤i≤m N i = t|S m = S * m (10) = (n -m)! t!(n -m -t)! × P[w ↔ at least one of nodes in V m |S m = S * m ] t × P[w ↔ none of nodes in V m |S m = S * m ] n-m-t .
