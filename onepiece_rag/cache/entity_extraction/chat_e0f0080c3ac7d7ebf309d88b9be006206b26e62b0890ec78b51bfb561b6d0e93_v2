This highlights the necessity offeature selection.• Concerning hybrid methods, on Avazu-FG, we observea noticeable drop in AUC for 'AutoFIS w/ AutoDim'compared to AutoDim, and even larger differences inAUC between 'AutoFIS w/ i-Razor' and i-Razor. OnCriteo-FG, i-Razor consistently outperforms 'AutoFISw/ i-Razor' in all evaluation metrics, demonstrating theadvantage of joint optimization over separate sequentialoptimization.• Dexterously balancing predictive performance andmodel compression, i-Razor surpasses top baselines. OnAvazu-FG, i-Razor jointly optimizes to retain informativefields. With fewer fields and Dims, it tends to concentratemore dimensions on predictive high-cardinality fieldswhile allocating relatively fewer dimensions to otherretained fields, increasing Params yet notably boostingAUC. On the remaining three datasets compared tostrong baselines, i-Razor aggressively slashes Paramswhile maintaining or even improving AUC. Combiningobservations on Avazu-FG and the remaining datasetsdemonstrates i-Razor's adept negotiation of predictiveperformance and compression with flexibility.In summary, our experiments underscore the significanceand advantages of feature selection and dimension search. </p><h2>figure_label</h2> <p> </p><h2>figure_type</h2> <p>table </p><h2>figure_id</h2> <p>tab_9 </p><h2>figure_caption</h2> <p>According to the complexity analysis in Section 3.4, when constructing the search space by dimension partitioning, the key factors to consider are the number of candidate dimensions K and the maximum dimension d K .

The performance of i-Razoron Avazu under these three schemes is summarized inTable 6, showing no significant differences. This experimentprovides empirical evidence that the model has a relativelylow sensitivity to dimension partitioning configurations. Onecontributing factor is the two-stage training procedure, whichseparates the search for optimal configurations in pretrainingfrom parameter tuning in retraining. The minor performancefluctuations imply the model's capability to reach similarsolutions despite varying partitioning schemes. </p><h2>figure_label</h2> <p>6 </p><h2>figure_type</h2> <p>table </p><h2>figure_id</h2> <p>tab_10 </p><h2>figure_caption</h2> <p>Impact of Candidate Dimension Set on Model Performance on Avazu.

The key idea is to introduce a soft selection layer that estimates the importance of different embedding regions and thus evaluates the field importance. Moreover, we design a CPTbased pruning algorithm to flexibly generate the mixed embedding configuration. While conceptually simple, i-Razor provides us with a concrete framework that is amenable to practicality and can be easily incorporated with various recommendation models.
