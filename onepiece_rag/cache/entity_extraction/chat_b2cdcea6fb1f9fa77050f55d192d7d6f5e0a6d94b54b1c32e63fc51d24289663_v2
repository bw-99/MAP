For visual one, it is usually modeled with naive convolutional networks and also hard to capture high-order relationships between users and items. Moreover, previous works did not collaboratively use both texts and images in a proper way. In this paper, we propose printf, preference modeling based on user reviews with item images and textual information via graph learning, to address the above challenges. Specifically, the dimensionbased attention mechanism directs relations between user reviews and interacted items, allowing each dimension to contribute different importance weights to derive user representations. Extensive experiments are conducted on three publicly available datasets. The experimental results demonstrate that our proposed printf consistently outperforms baseline methods with the relative improvements for NDCG@5 of 26.80%, 48.65%, and 25.74% on Amazon-Grocery, Amazon-Tools, and Amazon-Electronics datasets, respectively. The in-depth analysis also indicates the dimensions of review representations definitely have different topics and aspects, assisting the validity of our model design.<h1>sections</h1><h2>heading</h2>INTRODUCTION<h2>text</h2>In the era of information overload, recommender systems play a crucial role in satisfying users and keeping them engaged by providing personalized recommendations. With the increasing demand for customized contents on modern E-commerce and entertainment platforms, such as Yahoo News, Amazon Shopping, and Yelp, the effectiveness of recommendations is limited by existing user-item interactions and model capacity because of data sparsity. To address the sparsity issues, previous studies leverage higher-order relationships to mitigate the gaps between users and items. For example, as one of the most widely adopted and successful techniques, collaborative filtering (CF) [32] assumes low-rank relations between users and items, thereby establishing their relevance based on past interactions. Specifically, CF assumes that users with similar preferences will also consume similar items, thereby identifying items for recommendation [13,21,29,31,45,48]. In recent years, graph-based models, such as knowledge graph learning [1,39,41,42,47] and graph convolution networks (GCN) [10,12,38,46], are powerful approaches to improve the accuracy and scalability of collaborative filtering in recommendation systems by representing users and items as nodes in a graph with edges of their interactions. In other words, the graph structure enables the capability of capturing highorder relations among users and items beyond direct interactions.\nFor most modern e-commerce applications, besides structured data like product categories and brands, the majority of items are also accompanied by crucial unstructured data, such as product titles and images. Specifically, textual and image contents are the most popular unstructured data formats. However, the potential of those unstructured data has not been fully unleashed. For instance, conventional methods tackle texts and images with large-scale neural language models [7,25] and convolutional neural networks [16] or transformer-based visual models [8], respectively, but different data formats are modeled independently so that their knowledge cannot be aligned with each other. Moreover, to the best of our knowledge, none of the previous studies focus on simultaneously incorporating image and textual contents.\nAmong various textual contents, user reviews can become valuable resources to model their preferences and derive user representations [2,5,11,20,43] because detailed user opinions and item attributes can alleviate the data sparsity [33,49]. However, although some studies like RGCL [34] utilize reviews as edge features in graph-based models, the relations between reviews and item contents are not considered. This represents an unprecedented opportunity to improve the effectiveness of recommendation systems by leveraging both user reviews and item contents to generate more accurate personalized results.\nThe attention mechanism [37] is one of the most popular ways to model user interests from interacted items [51]. Previous studies like AGTM [14] also utilize attention to conquer the semantic gap between users and items, further differentiating the importance of interacted items toward the user. However, the previous attention mechanisms are based on vector similarities, where each latent dimension of item representations shares the same weight in computations. In other words, they lose the flexibility to learn distinct similarities of diversified topics within multiple dimensions of different semantics. Therefore, specifying different attention weights for each latent dimension can be a more suitable approach for assigning importance weights with better explanatory power.\nIn this paper, we present a novel framework, preference model based on user reviews with item images and textual information via graph learning (printf), which considers item images and textual contents as the primary source of item representations and leverages user reviews to determine user representations. Our framework consists of three sub-modules, including (1) Cross-Modality Item Modeling (CMIM), (2) Review-Aware User Modeling (RAUM), and (3) User-Item Embedding Propagation and Interaction Modeling (EPIM). CMIM fine-tunes our cross-modality feature encoder to extract image and text representations for items. RAUM leverages user reviews to distill user interests and preferences. User reviews are treated as an indicator to derive user embeddings. Compared to previous methods, instead of using a vector-wise inner product to compute the attention scores, we propose to compute multiple dimension-wise attention scores to learn diversified topics. EPIM employs the state-of-the-art graph convolutional network to propagate user-item embeddings and model high-order connectivity of user-item interactions.\nTo conclude, the main contributions of this work can be summarized as follows:\n• To the best of our knowledge, we are the first study to innovatively incorporate unstructured contents, such as user reviews, and the images and titles of items, as supplementary sources of multi-modality information.<h2>publication_ref</h2>['b31', 'b12', 'b20', 'b28', 'b30', 'b44', 'b47', 'b0', 'b38', 'b40', 'b41', '\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}}
