On the other hand, it can be shown that div(Ω) = 1/2. This means that in half of the cases the relation R Ω cannot tell which element is preferable out of two elements extracted independently and at random from Ω.\nT max 2 5 (0, 0) (1, 1) (b) y is preferable to x.\nMoreover if X 1 and X 2 are independent, then the condition for uniqueness from Eq. ( 6) holds. In the special case where X 1 and X 2 are uniformly distributed on the interval [0, 1], the joint cumulative probability distribution function takes form of F (x 1 , x 2 ) = x 1 x 2 and the at least k-Pareto optimal elements are situated below a hyperbola x 1 x 2 = k. Combining this fact with Corollary 1 yields a surprising characterization of hyperbola, see Fig. 4 and the statement below. </p><h2>publication_ref</h2> <p>[] </p><h2>figure_ref</h2> <p>['fig_3'] </p><h2>table_ref</h2> <p>[] </p><h2>heading</h2> <p>Characterization of Hyperbolas. </p><h2>text</h2> <p>Out of all descending functions f from [0, 1] to [0, 1] delimiting an area 1 0 f (x)dx = c, the arc of hyperbola is the one offering the highest likelihood the rectangles ((0, 0), (x 1 , 0), x, (0, x 2 )) and ((0, 0), (y 1 , 0), y, (0, y 2 )) are not nested for two points x and y being drawn independently and at random from the delimited area. </p><h2>publication_ref</h2> <p>[] </p><h2>figure_ref</h2> <p>[] </p><h2>table_ref</h2> <p>[] </p><h2>heading</h2> <p>Independence on Marginal Distribution </p><h2>text</h2> <p>Sklar's theorem [Sklar, 1959, Durante et al., 2013] states that the cumulative distribution function F (x 1 , x 2 ) can be represented as C(F 1 (x 1 ), F 2 (x 2 )) for a copula C. Marginas of X 1 and X 2 are fully described by the marginal cumulative probability distributions F 1 and F 2 , whereas the copula describes the dependence structure between X 1 and X 2 . The copula can be considered as a joint cumulative distribution function having two uniform marginal distributions on [0, 1]. Below we show that the introduced concepts do not depend on the marginal distribution of X 1 and X 2 .\nProposition 2. For a continuous random vector (X 1 , X 2 ) and the relation R Ω , k-Pareto optimality, choice, diversity and selections offering maximum choice only depend on the copula C of X 1 , X 2 .\nProof. Let us consider the mapping\nG : Ω → [0, 1] 2 , ω x → (F 1 (x 1 ), F 2 (x 2 )).\nWe consider R Ω and P defined on Ω. At the same time, on [0, 1] 2 we consider R defined by (x 1 , x 2 )R (y 1 , y 2 ) iff x 1 ≤ x 2 and y 1 ≤ y 2 , as well as the image measure G * P defined on [0, 1] 2 by (G * P )(A) = P (G -1 )(A). The map G preserves probabilities in the sense that for any measurable A in Ω we have (G * P )(G(A)) = P (A). Moreover, G preserves the relations in the sense that xR Ω y iff G(x)R G(y). Selections are preserved in the sense that if S is a selection for R Ω , then G(S) is a selection for R . Ignoring negligible subsets, this mapping between selections is one-to-one. Therefore, G also preserves selections, k-Pareto optimality, choice, and diversity.\nThe proposition finally results from the fact that G * P only depends on the copula. This is a consequence of the fact that for any (a 1 , a 2 ) ∈ [0, 1] 2 , we have\n(G * P )([0, a 1 ] × [0, a 2 ]) = C(a 1 , a 2 ).\nThis equality is a result of the following statements: 1) continuity which guarantees that a 1 and a 2 can be written as F 1 (x 1 ) and F 2 (x 2 ) for some appropriate x 1 and x 2 ; 2) the definition of image measure; 3) the fact that G = (F 1 , F 2 ) • (X 1 , X\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}}
