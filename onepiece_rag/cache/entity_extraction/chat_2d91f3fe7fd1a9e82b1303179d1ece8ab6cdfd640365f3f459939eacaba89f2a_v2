However, these solutions only focus on the ranking stage and not the filtering stage which are still impeded by memory bottlenecks due to the huge amount of data transfers.\nIn-memory-computing (IMC) is a computational paradigm that can alleviate the data transfer overhead between the memory and the compute unit by performing logic and arithmetic operations inside the memory unit itself. Different IMC kernels have been proposed, such as content addressable memories (CAMs), crossbars, general purpose computing-inmemory (GPCiM) and configurable memory arrays (CMAs). CAMs [5] can perform parallel content-based searches in the memory itself, crossbar arrays [6] can perform matrix-vector multiplications, and GPCiM [7] performs Boolean logic and arithmetic operations in memory. CMAs combine the functionalities of random access memory (RAM), CAM, GPCiM and crossbar in a single memory array. Ferroelectric fieldeffect transistors (FeFET) based crossbars, CAMS, GPCiM and CMAs have been designed [8], [9] and have shown that FeFET-based circuits are denser and faster than CMOS-based and ReRAM-based circuits. FeFETs can be easily integrated with the CMOS fabrication process and large-scale FeFET memories have also been fabricated in [10].\nIn this paper, we propose iMARS, an IMC architecture for RecSys. iMARS exploits an FeFET-based CMA fabric that combines the functionalities of RAM, ternary CAMs (TCAMs) and GPCiM. The FeFET-based CMA (from [9]) can switch its functionality to implement (i) TCAM-based searches to realize nearest neighbor search (NNS) in the filtering stage; and (ii) GPCiM-based arithmetic logic to implement the additions/accumulations in the filtering and ranking stage. Specific contributions of our work include (1) an integrated IMC fabric to simultaneously accelerate the filtering and ranking stages; (2) an IMC-friendly computation flow to facilitate mapping the RecSys algorithms to iMARS;\n(3) support for all ET related operations in memory by combining TCAM and GPCiM functionality in the CMA fabric; (4) a two-level memory hierarchy and corresponding in-memory adder trees to store the large ETs.\nWe have evaluated the latency and energy benefits of iMARS based on two widely used RecSys models: YoutubeDNN [2] on the MovieLens dataset [11] and Facebook DLRM [1] on the Criteo Kaggle dataset. The results show that for the MovieLens dataset, iMARS achieves a 16.8× (713×) end-to-end speedup (energy improvement) against the GPU implementation. For the Criteo Kaggle dataset which is widely used for the ranking task, the ranking model in Facebook DLRM is accelerated with iMARS, which leads to 13.2× (57.8×) improvement in latency (energy) improvement.  <h2>publication_ref</h2>['b0', 'b1', 'b1', 'b2', 'b3', 'b4', 'b5', 'b6', 'b7', 'b8', 'b9', 'b8', 'b1', 'b10', 'b0']<h2>figure_ref</h2>[]<h2>table_ref</h2>[]<h2>heading</h2>II. BACKGROUND<h2>text</h2>In this section, we review the basics of DNN-based Rec-Sys and related work on hardware accelerators for RecSys. Furthermore, we discuss the IMC circuits (TCAMs, GPCiMs, CMAs and crossbars) and technologies (i.e., CMOS, FeFETs) employed in iMARS.<h2>publication_ref</h2>[]<h2>figure_ref</h2>[]<h2>table_ref</h2>[]<h2>heading</h2>A. Recommendation Systems<h2>text</h2>RecSys are composed of a filtering and a ranking stage [2]. The filtering stage (Fig. 1(a)) aims to reduce the number of computations needed in the ranking stage by determining a set of candidate items (e.g. O(100)) from the entire item database (e.g. O(10 6 )). The ranking stage (Fig. 1(b)) aims to find the item with the highest score for a specific user from the candidate items. The filtering stage uses a DNN to characterize the user behavior as a single embedding vector. Based on this user behavior, the candidate items to recommend can be found by using the NNS on the item ET as shown in Fig. 1(a). The goal of the ranking stage is to evaluate each user-item pair and predict the score of each candidate item for a specific user. The score is defined as the click-through rate (CTR) and indicates the likelihood that an item will be clicked. Based on the scores, the top-k items (O (10)) are returned to the user (Fig. 1(b)).\nBoth DNN models in the filtering and ranking stages follow the configuration depicted in Fig. 1(c). DNNs are employed to generate the embedding vector representing the user behavior or predicting user-item pair scores. The models take advantage of both continuous (dense) and categorical (sparse) features.\nDense features can be directly processed by a DNN while sparse features are captured by large ETs with sparse lookup and pooling operations. These ET operations (lookups, NNS) contribute a significant portion of the run time\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}}
