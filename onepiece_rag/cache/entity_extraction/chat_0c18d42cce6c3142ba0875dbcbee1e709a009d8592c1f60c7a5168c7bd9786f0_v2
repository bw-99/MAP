The tool leverages an end-to-end trainable architecture that couples a BERT-based encoding module with a multi-label classification head to match relevant text passages from sustainability reports to their respective law regulations from the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) standards. We evaluate our model on two novel German sustainability reporting data sets and consistently achieve a significantly higher recommendation performance compared to multiple strong baselines.

Legislators worldwide and particularly in the EU become increasingly aware of the situation and have taken concrete political measures to enforce corporate social responsibility (CSR). In 2014 the EU approved the Non-Financial Reporting Directive (NFRD) which forces large companies to extend their reporting on policies, risks and key performance indicators regarding sustainability and social Figure 1: A screenshot of the sustain.AI recommender tool. After selecting a specific regulatory requirement from one of the categories, the system predicts the most relevant segments of a provided sustainability report. On the right side, the recommended segments are highlighted in the rendered report, fostering an efficient sustainability analysis. matters. Beginning in 2024 the NFRD will be updated with the stricter CSR-Directive, which applies to around 50,000 European companies and includes a wider catalog of reporting requirements covering environmental, social and governance aspects. The majority of these requirements are based on the popular regulatory framework from the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI). Its universal reporting standards provide a detailed set of indicators that address a company's impact on the economy, environment and people.\nIn light of these more comprehensive and rigorous sustainability regulations and the public's growing interest in corporate social responsibility, it is of vital importance to make the disclosed information easily accessible and comparable. However, manually retrieving and analyzing the published reports concerning specific GRI-Indicators is practically infeasible, especially considering that the documents often span around a hundred pages or more. This is particularly true for the auditing domain, where auditors spend hours to assure a report's compliance related to said CSR standards.\nHence, we introduce sustain.AI, a sophisticated, context-aware recommender system that utilizes modern techniques of natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning to process and analyze uploaded sustainability reports. Concretely, interested users like consumers or investors can query the recommender engine for specific GRI-indicators, e.g. the company's emissions (see Figure 1), and the engine returns and renders the most relevant document segments related to the query. Thus, stakeholders are able to quickly assess investment risks and opportunities arising from social and environmental issues and to evaluate the sustainability performance of companies. Similarly, auditors significantly benefit from the automated matching of concrete regulatory requirements to the relevant text passages. In fact, a large part of the sustainability report audit is about ensuring the completeness and correctness of the report according to the specified GRI standards.\nOur recommender system builds on a BERT-based [3] encoding module followed by a non-linear multi-label classification head. Both components are trained jointly in an end-to-end fashion leveraging weighted random sampling (WRS) to counter the significant class label imbalance. We evaluate the model on two novel German sustainability reporting data sets while consistently outperforming a large set of strong baselines by more than 10 percentage points in mean average precision.\nsustain.AI is released to the public as a KI-NRW demonstrator, which is available at https://sustain.ki.nrw/. First user tests have already promised significant efficiency gains for the analysis of sustainability reports in the context of auditing. Moreover, the continuous use in production will further improve the system's recommendation capabilities due to the integration of human feedback, e.g. in the form of correcting wrong predictions. </p><h2>publication_ref</h2> <p>['b2'] </p><h2>figure_ref</h2> <p>[] </p><h2>table_ref</h2> <p>[] </p><h2>heading</h2> <p>RELATED WORK </p><h2>text</h2> <p>Before continuing with the description of the inner workings of sustain.AI, we take a look at prior accomplishments of other researchers related to this work.\nIn terms of facilitating the audit of annual financial statements, [16] presented the Automated List Inspection (ALI) tool, a recommender system that ranks textual elements of financial documents to associated requirements of predefined regulatory frameworks like IFRS (International financial reporting standards) or HGB (Handelsgesetzbuch).
