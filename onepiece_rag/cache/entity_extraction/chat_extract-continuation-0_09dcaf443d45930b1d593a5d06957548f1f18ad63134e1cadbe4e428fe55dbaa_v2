Though more efficient for feature selection than Filter methods, Wrapper methods require higher computational resources [33]. In these two types of feature selection methods, the feature selection process and the model training process are distinctly separate.\nUnlike Filter and Wrapper methods, Embedded methods such as LASSO [14], GBDT [15], and semi-supervised recurrent convolutional attention models [34] integrate the feature selection process with the model training process, i.e., feature selection is performed automatically during the model training process [8]. Recently, the advancement of NAS has spawned a new research hotspot in Embedded methods, the automatic search for useful features with AutoML techniques [10], [35]. For instance, AutoFIS [36] proposes a gating mechanism to identify and mask the intersection of useless features in factorization models. AutoField [37] assigns two operators to each field, one for selecting and the other for ignoring that field. By comparing the relative importance of these two operators, it determines whether to select that field or not. Operators of each field of AutoField [37] and AutoFIS [36] are independent of each other, while AdaFS [38] assigns associated operators to each field through softmax operation, and measures the relative importance of fields corresponding to each operator by comparing the weight of each operator, so as to screen features. Meanwhile, there has been a growing interest in automatic feature selection in deep learning-based sequential recommendation systems. For instance, NASR [35] made significant strides in designing a hybrid sequential recommendation model with the aim to ensemble the capacity of both self-attention and convolutional architectures. The proposed method can automatically select the architecture operation on each layer.\nInspired by these advancements, our approach, i-Razor, also belongs to the Embedded category, but with a unique perspective. i-Razor facilitates model-consistent feature selection by evaluating the importance of each feature concerning its optimal embedding dimension in the target DNN model. Building upon the foundation laid by AutoField, we propose a 0-dimension absorbing operator, which signifies the action of deselecting a specific feature. In addition, we enhance the existing design of the dimension search space, which commonly segments the embedding dimensions, by introducing the concept of the 0-dimension operator into this process. The weight associated with each operator measures the relative importance of these divisions, with 0 dimension indicating that all regions should be masked. By considering combinations of these operators, we derive the final input configuration. This method allows us to perform dimension search and feature selection concurrently, offering a more efficient manner to ensure that the chosen features and embedding dimensions contribute to the target model's performance. </p><h2>publication_ref</h2> <p>['b21', 'b22', 'b21', 'b23', 'b24', 'b25', 'b26', 'b27', 'b8', 'b9', 'b28', 'b29', 'b30', 'b31', 'b12', 'b32', 'b13', 'b14', 'b33', 'b7', 'b9', 'b34', 'b35', 'b36', 'b36', 'b35', 'b37', 'b34'] </p><h2>figure_ref</h2> <p>[] </p><h2>table_ref</h2> <p>[] </p><h2>heading</h2> <p>Dimension Search Techniques </p><h2>text</h2> <p>Since assigning unified embedding dimensions to all features is incompatible with their heterogeneity, the new paradigm of mixed dimensions has gained more and more attention [7], [18], [20], [39]. To be specific, in a mixed dimension scheme, different features can have different embedding dimensions. There are two types of dimension search methods: featurelevel and field-level. Feature-level methods aim to assign different embedding dimensions to different features within the same field. For example, NIS [18] applies reinforcement learning to generate decision sequences on the selection of dimensions for different features. Other heuristic approaches, such as MDE [39], DPG [40], and MGQE [41], attempt to assign higher dimensions to features with higher frequencies. However, these methods suffer from numerous unique values in each field, while the feature frequencies are highly dynamic and not pre-known in real-life situations. Although the frequency of different features can be estimated by sampling, the fine-grained dimension search at feature level introduces a sizeable computational overhead and additional complexity. In this work, we focus on the second group for its efficiency, which aims to allocate different dimensions to different fields, while different features in the same field share a common dimension size. Based on advances in NAS [42], the second type of dimension search method normally adopts an AutoML style to search for the desired embedding dimension from a set of predefined candidate embedding dimensions. Inspired by DARTS [17], [43], AutoDim [19] proposes a differentiable search method to analyze the suitability of different candidate embedding dimensions by calculating the attention coefficients of the corresponding operators. After the search, AutoDim assigns to each field the candidate dimension size whose corresponding operator has maximum attention. DNIS [7] eliminates the dependency on predefined candidate dimensions by directly pruning non-informative embedding blocks whose values are less than a given threshold. Although existing dimension search methods work well in the case of a well-selected subset of fields, their effectiveness in the presence of the original set of fields without feature selection remains understudied.\nSimilar to AutoDim, our objective is to automatically search for the optimal embedding dimension configuration on a given set of embedding dimension candidates. We differ from AutoDim: i) We consider dimension search on the original field set and avoid dimension assignment to useless fields by introducing a novel candidate dimension,
