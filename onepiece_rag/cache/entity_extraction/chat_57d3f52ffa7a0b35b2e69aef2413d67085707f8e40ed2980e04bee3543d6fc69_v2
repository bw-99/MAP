From n ℓ ≤ n ℓ , n-ℓ r ≤ e(n-ℓ) r r and property (b) of Lemma 6, for n ≥ n ⋆ (R) (with n ⋆ (R) as specified in (163)) and for each r = R + 1, . . . , r n , we obtain\nf n,ℓ,r ≤ n ℓ • e(n -ℓ) r r • r r-2 (p e ) r-1 e -perλ(n-r-ℓ)\n≤ n ℓ+r e r (p e ) r-1 e -perλ(n-r-ℓ) .\nNow, observe that on the range r\n= R + 1, R + 2, . . . , ⌊ n-ℓ 2 ⌋, from r ≤ n-ℓ 2 , we have for all n sufficiently large, n-r -ℓ ≥ 1 2 (n -ℓ) ≥ n 3 .\nThis yields e -perλ(n-r-ℓ) ≤ e -perλn/3 .\nSubstituting p e = ln n+ℓ ln ln n+β ℓ,n n into (172), we also get e -perλn/3 = e -rλ(ln n+ℓ ln ln n+β ℓ,n )/3\n= n -rλ/3 (ln n) -rλℓ/3 e -rλβ ℓ,n /3 .\nApplying (172), (173) and p e ≤ 2 ln n n to (171), we get\nf n,ℓ,r ≤ n ℓ+r e r • 2 ln n n r-1 • n -rλ/3 (ln n) -rλℓ/3 e -rλβ ℓ,n /3 ≤ n ℓ+1-rλ/3 • (2e ln n) r = n ℓ+1 • (2en -λ/3 ln n) r .

We need consider only the case where r n ≤ ⌊ n-ℓ 2 ⌋ for infinitely many n, as otherwise (167) would hold trivially. From n ℓ ≤ n ℓ , n-ℓ r ≤ n r and property (b) of Lemma 6, we get for r = r n + 1, . . . , ⌊ n-ℓ 2 ⌋,\nf n,ℓ,r ≤ n ℓ n r e -perλ + e -Knµ n-ℓ2\n.\nWe will establish (167) in two steps. First set rn = 3 λpe . Obviously, the range r = r n + 1, . . . , ⌊ n-ℓ 2 ⌋ is intersecting the range r = rn , . . . , ⌊ n-ℓ 2 ⌋. We first consider the latter range below. For r = rn , . . . , ⌊ n-ℓ 2 ⌋, it follows that e -perλ ≤ e If rn ≤ r n + 1 for all n sufficiently large, then the desired condition (167) is automatically satisfied via (176). On the other hand, if r n + 1 < rn , we should still consider the range r = r n + 1, . . . , rn -1. On that range, we use arguments similar to those leading to (171) and obtain f n,ℓ,r ≤ n ℓ+r e r (p e ) r-1 e -perλ + e -Knµ n-r-ℓ (177) upon using also property (b) of Lemma 6.\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}}
