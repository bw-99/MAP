INTRODUCTION </p><h2>text</h2> <p>Recommendation systems (RecSys) have been used in various applications to suggest items such as movies, music, books, shopping items, websites, etc. based on a user's previous behavior, as well as historical data from other users. The large amount of available data allows RecSys to leverage deep neural networks (DNN). DNN-based RecSys have been widely adopted by companies like Facebook [1] and Google [2] to improve their online services.\nThe typical DNN-based RecSys inference process [2] includes two stages: filtering and ranking. In the filtering stage, the system selects a set of candidate items from a large item database to be recommended based on a user's behavior. The ranking stage then computes the probability of choosing each candidate item. The items with the highest probability are finally returned to the user. Both the filtering and ranking stage use embedding tables (ETs) to capture and store user behaviors and item characteristics. The large ETs make the operations on them memory-bandwidth limited.\nSeveral algorithm and hardware solutions, e.g., ET compression [3], have been proposed to alleviate the memorybandwidth bottleneck. Near-memory computing has also been leveraged to solve the memory-bandwidth problem by bringing the compute units closer to the memory [4]. However, these solutions only focus on the ranking stage and not the filtering stage which are still impeded by memory bottlenecks due to the huge amount of data transfers.\nIn-memory-computing (IMC) is a computational paradigm that can alleviate the data transfer overhead between the memory and the compute unit by performing logic and arithmetic operations inside the memory unit itself. Different IMC kernels have been proposed, such as content addressable memories (CAMs), crossbars, general purpose computing-inmemory (GPCiM) and configurable memory arrays (CMAs). CAMs [5] can perform parallel content-based searches in the memory itself, crossbar arrays [6] can perform matrix-vector multiplications, and GPCiM [7] performs Boolean logic and arithmetic operations in memory. CMAs combine the functionalities of random access memory (RAM), CAM, GPCiM and crossbar in a single memory array. Ferroelectric fieldeffect transistors (FeFET) based crossbars, CAMS, GPCiM and CMAs have been designed [8], [9] and have shown that FeFET-based circuits are denser and faster than CMOS-based and ReRAM-based circuits. FeFETs can be easily integrated with the CMOS fabrication process and large-scale FeFET memories have also been fabricated in [10].\nIn this paper, we propose iMARS, an IMC architecture for RecSys. iMARS exploits an FeFET-based CMA fabric that combines the functionalities of RAM, ternary CAMs (TCAMs) and GPCiM. The FeFET-based CMA (from [9]) can switch its functionality to implement (i) TCAM-based searches to realize nearest neighbor search (NNS) in the filtering stage; and (ii) GPCiM-based arithmetic logic to implement the additions/accumulations in the filtering and ranking stage. Specific contributions of our work include (1) an integrated IMC fabric to simultaneously accelerate the filtering and ranking stages; (2) an IMC-friendly computation flow to facilitate mapping the RecSys algorithms to iMARS;\n(3) support for all ET related operations in memory by combining TCAM and GPCiM functionality in the CMA fabric; (4) a two-level memory hierarchy and corresponding in-memory adder trees to store the large ETs.\nWe have evaluated the latency and energy benefits of iMARS based on two widely used RecSys models: YoutubeDNN [2] on the MovieLens dataset [11] and Facebook DLRM [1] on the Criteo Kaggle dataset. The results show that for the MovieLens dataset, iMARS achieves a 16.8√ó (713√ó) end-to-end speedup (energy improvement) against the GPU implementation. For the Criteo Kaggle dataset which is widely used for the ranking task, the ranking model in Facebook DLRM is accelerated with iMARS, which leads to 13.2√ó (57.8√ó) improvement in latency (energy) improvement.   </p><h2>publication_ref</h2> <p>['b0', 'b1', 'b1', 'b2', 'b3', 'b4', 'b5', 'b6', 'b7', 'b8', 'b9', 'b8', 'b1', 'b10', 'b0'] </p><h2>figure_ref</h2> <p>[] </p><h2>table_ref</h2> <p>[] </p><h2>heading</h2>\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>RECOMMENDATION SYSTEMS<|>concept<|>Recommendation systems (RecSys) suggest items to users by predicting their preferences based on historical data and user behavior.)\n(\"entity\"<|>HISTORICAL DATA<|>concept<|>Historical data is utilized by recommendation systems to predict user preferences and improve item suggestions.)\n(\"entity\"<|>IMC ARCHITECTURE<|>concept<|>In-memory-computing (IMC) architecture (iMARS) is proposed to enhance the performance of recommendation systems by accelerating filtering and ranking stages.)\n(\"entity\"<|>FERROELECTRIC FET<|>concept<|>Ferroelectric FET is a type of transistor used in the IMC fabric to implement embedding tables and improve performance.)\n(\"entity\"<|>MOVIELENS DATASET<|>concept<|>The MovieLens dataset is a widely used dataset for evaluating recommendation systems, particularly in the context of iMARS.)\n(\"entity\"<|>GPU<|>concept<|>GPU is a conventional computing architecture used for comparison with iMARS in terms of latency and energy consumption.)\n(\"entity\"<|>EMBEDDING TABLES<|>concept<|>Embedding tables (ETs) are used in recommendation systems to capture and store user behaviors and item characteristics.)\n(\"entity\"<|>DEEP NEURAL NETWORKS<|>concept<|>Deep neural networks (DNN) are utilized in recommendation systems to process large amounts of data and improve item suggestions.)\n(\"entity\"<|>CIRCUIT-LEVEL EVALUATION<|>concept<|>Circuit-level evaluation assesses the performance of the iMARS architecture in terms of latency and energy efficiency.)\n(\"entity\"<|>CRITEO KAGGLE DATASET<|>concept<|>The Criteo Kaggle dataset is another dataset used for evaluating ranking tasks in recommendation systems, particularly with Facebook DLRM.)\n(\"relationship\"<|>RECOMMENDATION SYSTEMS<|>HISTORICAL DATA<|>Recommendation systems leverage historical data to enhance their predictions and suggestions for users<|>8)\n(\"relationship\"<|>IMC ARCHITECTURE<|>RECOMMENDATION SYSTEMS<|>IMC architecture (iMARS) is designed to improve the performance of recommendation systems by optimizing filtering and ranking stages<|>9)\n(\"relationship\"<|>IMC ARCHITECTURE<|>FERROELECTRIC FET<|>IMC architecture utilizes ferroelectric FET technology to implement efficient embedding tables<|>7)\n(\"relationship\"<|>MOVIELENS DATASET<|>IMC ARCHITECTURE<|>The MovieLens dataset is used to evaluate the performance improvements of the iMARS architecture<|>6)\n(\"relationship\"<|>GPU<|>IMC ARCHITECTURE<|>The performance of the iMARS architecture is compared to that of the GPU in terms of latency and energy consumption<|>5)\n(\"relationship\"<|>EMBEDDING TABLES<|>RECOMMENDATION SYSTEMS<|>Embedding tables are essential components in recommendation systems for storing user and item data<|>8)\n(\"relationship\"<|>DEEP NEURAL NETWORKS<|>RECOMMENDATION SYSTEMS<|>Deep neural networks are employed in recommendation systems to process large datasets and improve item suggestions<|>7)\n(\"relationship\"<|>CIRCUIT-LEVEL EVALUATION<|>IMC ARCHITECTURE<|>Circuit-level evaluation measures the efficiency and performance of the iMARS architecture<|>6)\n(\"relationship\"<|>CRITEO KAGGLE DATASET<|>IMC ARCHITECTURE<|>The Criteo Kaggle dataset is used to assess the ranking capabilities of the iMARS architecture<|>5) \n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
