If X 1 and X 2 are two continuous independent random variables, then for the relation\nR Ω P (T k ) = k -k ln(k), cho(T k ) = (k -k ln(k)) 2 -k 2 1 2 -ln k .\nProof. Let us again consider the map G. The image measure G * P induced by G on [0, 1] 2 is the Lesbegue area measure. Independently of P , we have\nG(T k ) = {(x 1 , x 2 ) ∈ [0, 1] 2 |x 1 x 2 ≤ k}.\nSimple integration for Eq. ( 7) yields\nP (po -1 (] -∞, x])) = P (T x ), = (x1,x2)∈[0,1] 2 (G(T x )) = x -x ln(x).\nTherefore, po * P = -ln(x)dx and Eq. ( 7) results in\ncho(T k ) = (k -k ln(k)) 2 -2 k 0 x(-ln(x))dx, = (k -k ln(k)) 2 -k 2 (1/2 -ln k) .\nNow, it is possible to show that lim k→0 div(T k ) = 1.\nThe fact that diversity slowly tends to the maximum 0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1 0.0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1.0 \nx 1 x 2 min(x 1 , x 2 ) max(x 1 , x 2 ) (x 1 + x 2 )/2 x 1 x 2 (po)\nmin(x 1 , x 2 ) max(x 1 , x 2 ) (x 1 + x 2 )/2 x 1 x 2 (po)\nFigure 6: Fraction of the best elements and diversity.\npossible value of 1 as k tends to zero becomes even more surprising if one looks at the selections\nT min a = {(x 1 , x 2 ) ∈ [0, 1] 2 | min(x 1 , x 2 ) ≤ a}, T max a = {(x 1 , x 2 ) ∈ [0, 1] 2 | max(x 1 , x 2 ) ≤ a}.\nHere, lim a→0 div(T min a ) = 3 4 , and div(T max a ) = 1 2 . To further illustrate this observation, let us consider selections of a fixed measure m, which represent the best m * 100% of elements, defined with different sorting criteria: minimum min(x 1 , x 2 ), maximum max(x 1 , x 2 ), average x1+x2 2 , and Pareto optimality x 1 x 2foot_6 . As we can see in Fig. 6, min(x 1 , x 2 ) delimits selections containing too many large values, that is, extremes are overvalued. On the other hand, all other sorting criteria except po undervalue extremes and include too many elements situated around the diagonal\nx 1 = x 2 .\nFinally, in Fig. 6 we demonstrate how diversity of the selections defined above depends on the fraction of selected elements mfoot_7 . We can see that diversity is the largest when sorting by k-Pareto optimality.

However, the total number of linear extensions exponentially increases with n, and the resulting algorithms are complex and slow [de Loof, 2010, p. 48]. For example, random sampling of linear extensions has an expected running time of O(n 3 log n) [Huber, 2006]. Below we show that sorting by k-Pareto optimality offers an efficient alternative.\nThe basic algorithm for the k-Pareto optimality based sorting is straightforward.
