Noisy features and inappropriate embedding dimension assignments can deteriorate the performance of recommender systems and introduce unnecessary complexity in model training and online serving. Optimizing the input configuration of DNN models, including feature selection and embedding dimension assignment, has become one of the essential topics in feature engineering. However, in existing industrial practices, feature selection and dimension search are optimized sequentially, i.e., feature selection is performed first, followed by dimension search to determine the optimal dimension size for each selected feature. Such a sequential optimization mechanism increases training costs and risks generating suboptimal input configurations. To address this problem, we propose a differentiable neural input razor (i-Razor) that enables joint optimization of feature selection and dimension search. Concretely, we introduce an end-to-end differentiable model to learn the relative importance of different embedding regions of each feature. Furthermore, a flexible pruning algorithm is proposed to achieve feature filtering and dimension derivation simultaneously. Extensive experiments on two large-scale public datasets in the Click-Through-Rate (CTR) prediction task demonstrate the efficacy and superiority of i-Razor in balancing model complexity and performance.<h1>sections</h1><h2>heading</h2>INTRODUCTION<h2>text</h2>I N this era of information overload, recommender systems powered by information technology and deep learning have become an effective way to retrieve potentially useful information for users from a huge range of options [1], [2], [3]. Deep learning recommender systems enhance recommendation performance by capturing complex correlations between features [4]. Experts resort to feature engineering, generating categorical, numerical, statistical, and cross features, to better understand the user's interests. However, due to the universal approximation property [5] of deep neural networks (DNN), feeding noisy features into a DNN model can adversely affect predictive performance [4], [6]. Meanwhile, because the embedding lookup table dominates both the size and inductive bias of DNN-based recommendation models [7], the embedding dimensions of input features are crucial to the performance and complexity of recommender systems. Therefore, it is highly desired to efficiently identify effective features from the original feature set and specify appropriate embedding dimensions. As illustrated in Figure 1, conventional industrial practices typically optimize feature selection and embedding dimension allocation separately. In contrast, this work explores jointly optimizing both in an end-to-end fashion. Feature selection is a crucial task in recommender systems and has been the subject of extensive research. Previous studies have categorized feature selection methods into three main categories: Filter, Wrapper, and Embedded methods [8], [9], [10]. Filter methods measure the discriminant attributes of features through criteria such as information gain [11] and feature consistency [12], so as to extract high-ranked features. Wrapper methods optimize feature subsets by using performance assessments such as the K-nearest neighbor (KNN) algorithm and linear discriminant analysis (LDA) instead of solely relying on evaluation criteria [13].
