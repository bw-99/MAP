If J i does not exist, then d i is set to z * for notational brevity. Therefore, the amount of workload W i (t) of all the released jobs of task τ i for i = 1, 2, . . . , k -1 to be executed in time interval (z * , z * + t) is at most\nW i (t) = (d i -z * ) • U i + t -(d i -z * ) T i C i .(47)\nThe assumption of the unschedulability of job J 1 (due to the unschedulability of job J 1 ) under the global fixed-priority scheduling implies that J 1 cannot finish its computation at any time between z * and z 0 . This leads to the following\n(necessary) condition ∆ max k (z 0 -z * ) + τ i ∈hp(τ k ) W i (t) M > t for all 0 < t ≤ z * -z 0 for the unschedulability of job J 1 .\nTherefore, by the existence of y = z 1 -z * (with y ≥ 0) and ω i = d i -z * (with 0 ≤ ω i ≤ T i ) for i = 1, 2, . . . , k -1 to enforce the above necessary condition, we reach the conclusion of the proof by contrapositive. That is, task τ k is schedulable if, for all y ≥ 0 and any combination of 0 ≤ ω i ≤ T i for i = 1, 2, . . . , k -1, there exists 0\n< t ≤ D k + y with ∆ max k (D k + y) + τ i ∈hp(τ k ) ωi•Ui+ t-ω i T i Ci M ≤ t.\nThe schedulability condition in Lemma 9 may look at the first glance strange. We briefly explain the logical meaning (but informally) here. Suppose we would like to know whether a job of task τ k arrived at time r k can be finished before/at time r k + D k . To better quantify the interference from the higher-priority tasks, we would like to account for the higherpriority jobs arrived prior to r k . The variable y defines the extension of the window of interest from [r k , r k + D k ) to [r k -y, r k +D k ). The variable ω i defines the maximum residual execution time ω i T i of a carry-in job of task τ i that arrives before r k -y and should be executed in the window of interest, i.e., [r k -y, r k + D k ). If the residual workload is at most ω i T i , the next job can be released at time r k -y + ω i , as shown in the proof. Task τ k is schedulable by the global fixedpriority scheduling, if, for any combinations of y ≥ 0 and 0 ≤ ω i ≤ T i , ∀τ i ∈ hp(τ k ), we can always finish the inflated workload ∆ max k • (D k + y) of task τ k and the higher-priority workload in the window of interest. For formal explanations, please refer to the formal proof of Lemma 9.\nNote that the schedulability condition in Lemma 9 requires to test all possible y ≥ 0 and all possible settings of 0 ≤ ω i ≤ T i for the higher-priority tasks τ i with i = 1, 2, . . . , k -1. Therefore, it needs exponential time (for all the possible combinations of ω i ). 7 However, we are not going to directly use the test in Lemma 9 in the paper. We will only use this test to construct the corresponding k-point schedulability test under Definition 2.\nWe present the corresponding polynomial-time schedulability tests for global fixed-priority scheduling. More specifically, we will also analyze the capacity augmentation factors of these tests for global RM and global DM in Corollaries 3 and 4, respectively.\nTheorem 8. Let U max k be max k j=1 U j . Task τ k in a sporadic task system with implicit deadlines is schedulable by global RM on M processors if\nU max k ≤ 1 - 2 M k-1 i=1 U i + 0.5 M 2 ( k-1 i=1 U i ) 2 + ( k-1 i=1 U 2 i ) (48) or k-1 j=1 U j M ≤ k -1 k 2 -2 + 2U max k k k -1 .(49)\nProof: We will show that the schedulability condition in the theorem holds for all possible settings of y and ω i s. Suppose that y and ω i for i = 1, 2, . . . , k -1 are given, in which y ≥ 0 and 0 ≤ ω i ≤ T i . Let t k be T k + y. Now, we set t i to ω i + T k +y-ωi Ti T i for i = 1, 2, . . . , k -1 and reindex the tasks\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>J1<|>EVENT<|>Job J1 is a task that is unschedulable under global fixed-priority scheduling, indicating it cannot finish its computation within a specified time frame.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>TASK τk<|>EVENT<|>Task τk is a sporadic task in a system with implicit deadlines, which is being analyzed for schedulability under global RM on M processors.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GLOBAL FIXED-PRIORITY SCHEDULING<|>EVENT<|>Global fixed-priority scheduling is a scheduling algorithm that prioritizes tasks based on their fixed priorities, affecting the execution of jobs in a system.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LEMMA 9<|>EVENT<|>Lemma 9 presents a necessary condition for the unschedulability of job J1 and discusses the conditions under which task τk is schedulable.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>COROLLARIES 3 AND 4<|>EVENT<|>Corollaries 3 and 4 analyze the capacity augmentation factors for global RM and global DM scheduling tests.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>Umaxk<|>EVENT<|>Umaxk is the maximum utilization of tasks in a sporadic task system, which is a critical factor in determining schedulability.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SPORADIC TASK SYSTEM<|>EVENT<|>A sporadic task system is a type of scheduling model where tasks arrive at unpredictable intervals, requiring specific analysis for schedulability.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>J1<|>TASK τk<|>Job J1's unschedulability affects the analysis of task τk's schedulability under global fixed-priority scheduling<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>TASK τk<|>GLOBAL FIXED-PRIORITY SCHEDULING<|>Task τk is being evaluated for its schedulability under the global fixed-priority scheduling algorithm<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>LEMMA 9<|>TASK τk<|>Lemma 9 provides a necessary condition for the unschedulability of job J1, which is relevant to the analysis of task τk<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>COROLLARIES 3 AND 4<|>GLOBAL FIXED-PRIORITY SCHEDULING<|>Corollaries 3 and 4 provide insights into the performance of global RM and DM scheduling tests, which relate to global fixed-priority scheduling<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>Umaxk<|>TASK τk<|>Umaxk is a critical parameter in determining the schedulability of task τk in a sporadic task system<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SPORADIC TASK SYSTEM<|>TASK τk<|>Task τk is part of a sporadic task system, which influences its scheduling analysis<|>6)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
