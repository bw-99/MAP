Let's consider an empirical optimization procedure with an l 0 regularization on the embedding masks during the searching stage:\nR ( ùëΩ, ùúΩ  ùëè , ùíé ) = E ùëñ E ùíé ùëñ L( ùëì ùúΩ ùëè ( ùëΩ ùëè ‚Ä¢ ùëø ùëñ ‚äô ùíé ùëñ ), ùë¶ ùëñ ) , (3) with regularizer R (ùíé) = E ùëñ E ùíé ùëñ [ ùúÜ ‚à•ùíé ùëñ ‚à• 0 ] ,(4)\nwhere L( ùëó=1 ùëù ùëñ,ùëó . Our experimentation, however, indicates that simply using this l 0 regularizer still experiences the heavy-tailedness and distinction difficulties, as discussed in Section 3.3.2. Inspired from Zhuang et al. [41], we incorporate a polarization regularizer into Equation 4:\nR (ùíé) = ‚àëÔ∏Å ùëñ ùëÅ * ‚àëÔ∏Å ùëó=1 ùúÜ ùëù ùëñ,ùëó -|ùëù ùëñ,ùëó -pùëñ |, with pùëñ = 1 ùëÅ * ùëÅ * ‚àëÔ∏Å ùëó=1 ùëù ùëñ,ùëó .(5)\nThe intuition of the second term (which is the polarization regularizer) is to maximally distance ùëù ùëñ,ùëó from their mean pùëñ . Empirically, we have observed this polarization term effectively separates the probabilities of important and unimportant dimensions into two groups, thereby making them distinguishable (see Figure 3). Despite employing the regularizer as stated in Equation 5, a threshold searcher is still required to identify the threshold for ùëù ùëñ,ùëó . Currently, the histogram of ùëù ùëñ,ùëó trained with the polarization regularizer should have at least two peaks, with one of them located close to 0. Following the strategy from [41], we scan the histogram from left to right to identify the first saddle point, i.e., the bin that contains the local minimum (the red pin in Figure 2). The lower bound of this bin is subsequently set as the threshold. </p><h2>publication_ref</h2> <p>['b40', 'b40'] </p><h2>figure_ref</h2> <p>['fig_2', 'fig_1'] </p><h2>table_ref</h2> <p>[] </p><h2>heading</h2> <p>Clusters </p><h2>text</h2> <p>Once obtaining a sample's unique embedding masks, our aim is to pass this sample through a recommender model tailored to its distinct dimension selection. This implies that, for every sample with its individual selected dimensions, there always exists a customized recommender model capable of handling this distinct input and generating a precise prediction. Nonetheless, training an extensive number of recommender models is impractical due to the constraint of finite data size. For example, with a obviously underestimated dimension, ùëÅ * = 100, the number of possible combinations of dimensions is 100 ùëò=0 100 ùëò = 2 100 , meaning at least 2 100 distinct samples should be collected.\nConsequently, we must strike a balance between using a one-sizefits-all recommender model (inadequate for highly heterogeneous samples) and using a fully-customized recommender model for each sample. Our resolution is to leverage clustering algorithms to segregate samples into separate groups. We anticipate that samples update ùëΩ, ùúΩ  1 according the objective from Eq. 3 20: end while 21: repeat lines 16-20 with D train 2 , D val 2 , and ùëΩ, ùúΩ  2 within the same group display similar patterns, which could be used to explore identical dimension patterns and identical recommender models. Furthermore, partitioning the data into clusters facilitates the training of small and manageable models for each cluster, thus accelerating the inference speed.\nIn this iHAS framework, we opt for the mini-batch K-Means clustering algorithm [28] to partition the samples. We chose this variant due to its computational efficiency in handling large datasets (comprised of tens of millions of samples), and its capacity to avoid getting stuck at local optima. </p><h2>publication_ref</h2> <p>['b27'] </p><h2>figure_ref</h2> <p>[] </p><h2>table_ref</h2> <p>[] </p><h2>heading</h2> <p>Optimization Strategy </p><h2>text</h2> <p>In the iHAS framework, we adopt a hierarchical training strategy to optimize different modules in different stages, inspired by [12,15,24,33], to tackle the encoding issue of jointly optimizing all modules.
