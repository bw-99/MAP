BACKGROUND </p><h2>text</h2> <p>In this section, we review the basics of DNN-based Rec-Sys and related work on hardware accelerators for RecSys. Furthermore, we discuss the IMC circuits (TCAMs, GPCiMs, CMAs and crossbars) and technologies (i.e., CMOS, FeFETs) employed in iMARS. </p><h2>publication_ref</h2> <p>[] </p><h2>figure_ref</h2> <p>[] </p><h2>table_ref</h2> <p>[] </p><h2>heading</h2> <p>A. Recommendation Systems </p><h2>text</h2> <p>RecSys are composed of a filtering and a ranking stage [2]. The filtering stage (Fig. 1(a)) aims to reduce the number of computations needed in the ranking stage by determining a set of candidate items (e.g. O(100)) from the entire item database (e.g. O(10 6 )). The ranking stage (Fig. 1(b)) aims to find the item with the highest score for a specific user from the candidate items. The filtering stage uses a DNN to characterize the user behavior as a single embedding vector. Based on this user behavior, the candidate items to recommend can be found by using the NNS on the item ET as shown in Fig. 1(a). The goal of the ranking stage is to evaluate each user-item pair and predict the score of each candidate item for a specific user. The score is defined as the click-through rate (CTR) and indicates the likelihood that an item will be clicked. Based on the scores, the top-k items (O (10)) are returned to the user (Fig. 1(b)).\nBoth DNN models in the filtering and ranking stages follow the configuration depicted in Fig. 1(c). DNNs are employed to generate the embedding vector representing the user behavior or predicting user-item pair scores. The models take advantage of both continuous (dense) and categorical (sparse) features.\nDense features can be directly processed by a DNN while sparse features are captured by large ETs with sparse lookup and pooling operations. These ET operations (lookups, NNS) contribute a significant portion of the run time in RecSys as shown in the operation breakdown of the MovieLens dataset using the YouTubeDNN RecSys [2] in Fig. 2.\nExisting efforts on accelerating RecSys include field programmable gate array (FPGA)-based accelerators. E.g., Flee-tRec [12] and MicroRec [13] alleviate the memory-bandwidth bottleneck of the ETs in RecSys by using FPGAs with high bandwidth memory. Near-memory computing has also been considered to alleviate the memory bottleneck. RecNMP [4] uses a dual in-line memory module-based near-memory computing that can support sparse embedding models. Most of these existing hardware accelerators only focus on a single aspect of RecSys, i.e., ranking, filtering, DNNs or ETs. Though it is possible to simply cascade these accelerators to implement RecSys, such a simple-minded approach results in higher hardware cost due to duplicated components. </p><h2>publication_ref</h2> <p>['b1', 'b9', 'b1', 'b11', 'b12', 'b3'] </p><h2>figure_ref</h2> <p>['fig_0', 'fig_0', 'fig_0', 'fig_0', 'fig_0', 'fig_1'] </p><h2>table_ref</h2> <p>[] </p><h2>heading</h2> <p>B. In-Memory Computing Circuits </p><h2>text</h2> <p>IMC circuits can alleviate the memory bottleneck and provide parallelism to RecSys operations. This section discusses different types of IMC circuits such as TCAMs, crossbars, GPCiMs and CMA.\nTCAMs enable parallel searches based on the Hamming distance for a query against a large stored database in O(1) time [5]. Using the threshold-match mode of the TCAMs, we can retrieve the row entries in the array nearest to the query under the threshold distance by parallel searches. In a TCAM array with r rows and c columns, the TCAM cells in a row are serially connected through a common matchline. Each TCAM cell, s ij , performs an XOR operation between bit j of query Q and the bit j stored at s ij . Each matchline implements a logic AND of all the cells connected to it.\nCrossbars are an IMC structure where every input is connected to every output through cross-points that consist of memory elements\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>FACEBOOK DLRM<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Facebook DLRM is a ranking model that is accelerated with iMARS for improved performance on the Criteo Kaggle dataset.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>IMARS<|>CONCEPT<|>iMARS is a technology that accelerates the ranking model in Facebook DLRM, leading to significant improvements in latency and energy efficiency.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>RECOMMENDATION SYSTEMS<|>CONCEPT<|>Recommendation Systems (RecSys) are systems designed to filter and rank items for users based on their preferences and behaviors.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DNN<|>CONCEPT<|>DNN (Deep Neural Networks) are used in RecSys for generating embedding vectors that represent user behavior and predicting scores for user-item pairs.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>FPGA<|>CONCEPT<|>Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) are hardware accelerators used to alleviate memory-bandwidth bottlenecks in RecSys.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ET<|>CONCEPT<|>ET (Embedding Tables) are structures used in RecSys to capture sparse features and perform lookups for user-item recommendations.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>TCAMS<|>CONCEPT<|>TCAMs (Ternary Content Addressable Memories) are IMC circuits that enable parallel searches in databases, improving efficiency in RecSys operations.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CMA<|>CONCEPT<|>CMA (Content Addressable Memory) is a type of memory used in IMC circuits to enhance performance in RecSys.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GPCIMS<|>CONCEPT<|>GPCiMs (Generalized Pipelined Content Addressable Memories) are IMC circuits that provide parallelism to RecSys operations.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>FACEBOOK DLRM<|>IMARS<|>iMARS accelerates the ranking model in Facebook DLRM, leading to improvements in performance metrics like latency and energy efficiency.<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>RECOMMENDATION SYSTEMS<|>DNN<|>DNNs are employed in Recommendation Systems to generate embedding vectors and predict scores for user-item pairs.<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>RECOMMENDATION SYSTEMS<|>ET<|>ETs are used in Recommendation Systems to capture sparse features and perform lookups for recommendations.<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>RECOMMENDATION SYSTEMS<|>FPGA<|>FPGAs are utilized in Recommendation Systems to alleviate memory-bandwidth bottlenecks, enhancing overall performance.<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>IMARS<|>FPGA<|>iMARS and FPGAs are both technologies aimed at improving the efficiency of Recommendation Systems, albeit in different ways.<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>IMARS<|>RECOMMENDATION SYSTEMS<|>iMARS contributes to the performance of Recommendation Systems by accelerating the ranking model.<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>TCAMS<|>RECOMMENDATION SYSTEMS<|>TCAMs enable parallel searches in Recommendation Systems, improving the efficiency of item retrieval.<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CMA<|>RECOMMENDATION SYSTEMS<|>CMA is a type of memory used in Recommendation Systems to enhance performance through efficient data retrieval.<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>GPCIMS<|>RECOMMENDATION SYSTEMS<|>GPCiMs provide parallelism in Recommendation Systems, contributing to faster processing of user-item interactions.<|>6)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
