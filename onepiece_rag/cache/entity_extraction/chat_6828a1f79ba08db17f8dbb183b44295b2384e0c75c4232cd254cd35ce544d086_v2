The relation R models preference for small values of x 1 and x 2 . However, instead of assuming X to be a finite subset of R 2 , we now study the unit square [0, 1] × [0, 1] with three continuous measures: the Lebesgue area measure dx 1 dx 2 , as well as 2x 2 dx 1 dx 2 and 4x 1 x 2 dx 1 dx 2 . In each case, the total measure of the unit square equals to one. The Lebesgue area measure represents elements with two uniformly distributed characteristics x 1 and x 2 ; 2x 2 dx 1 dx 2 represents rarefaction of items having small values of x 2 , whereas 4x 1 x 2 dx 1 dx 2 represents rarefaction of items having small values of both x 1 and x 2 .\nFor each of the cases defined above, in Fig. 8a we show the set of at least k-Pareto optimal elements of measure 0.1, which corresponds to selecting the 10 best percent. All three sets demonstrate the qualitative behaviours expected from sets delimited by indifference curves when the corresponding rarefaction occurs. Indeed, the curve corresponding to the uniform distribution and the Lebesgue area measure dx 1 dx 2 is symmetric. Also, in this case, po(x 1 , x 1 ) = x 1 x 2 , and the sets of at least k-Pareto optimal elements are the sets situated below arcs of hyperbola defined by the equation x 1 x 2 = k, see Sections 4.2 and 4.2.1 for more details. Applying rarefaction with respect to x 2 prioritises smaller values of this characteristic. This is represented by shifting upwards the right part of the hyperbola arc, see the curve for 2x 2 dx 1 dx 2 . Indeed, in this case, the small values of x 2 are observed less often. This results in selecting additional elements with large values of x 1 but relatively small values of x 2 to compensate for this rarefaction. Finally, rarefaction with respect to both x 1 and x 2 results in the fact that the small values of both characteristics are observed less often. Thus, elements with larger values of x 1 and x 2 should be selected to generate a selection of the required measure. It results in the shift of the hyperbola upwards following the direction of the main diagonal, see the curve for 4x 1 x 2 dx 1 dx 2 .   </p><h2>publication_ref</h2> <p>[] </p><h2>figure_ref</h2> <p>[] </p><h2>table_ref</h2> <p>[] </p><h1>references</h1><h2>ref_id</h2> <p>b0 </p><h2>title</h2> <p> </p><h2>journal</h2> <p> </p><h2>year</h2> <p>2010 </p><h2>authors</h2> <p> Croft </p><h2>ref_id</h2> <p>b1 </p><h2>title</h2> <p>Search engines: Information retrieval in practice </p><h2>journal</h2> <p>Addison-Wesley Reading </p><h2>year</h2> <p>2010 </p><h2>authors</h2> <p>W B Croft; D Metzler; T Strohman </p><h2>ref_id</h2> <p>b2 </p><h2>title</h2> <p> </p><h2>journal</h2> <p> </p><h2>year</h2> <p>1957 </p><h2>authors</h2> <p> Dantzig </p><h2>ref_id</h2> <p>b3 </p><h2>title</h2> <p>Discretevariable extremum problems </p><h2>journal</h2> <p>Operations research </p><h2>year</h2> <p>1957 </p><h2>authors</h2> <p>G B Dantzig </p><h2>ref_id</h2> <p>b4 </p><h2>title</h2> <p> </p><h2>journal</h2> <p> </p><h2>year</h2> <p>2002 </p><h2>authors</h2> <p>Priestley Davey </p><h2>ref_id</h2> <p>b5 </p><h2>title</h2> <p>Introduction to lattices and order </p><h2>journal</h2> <p>Cambridge university press </p><h2>year</h2> <p>2002 </p><h2>authors</h2> <p>B A Davey; H A Priestley </p><h2>ref_id</h2> <p>b6 </p><h2>title</h2> <p> </p><h2>journal</h2> <p> </p><h2>year</h2> <\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}}
