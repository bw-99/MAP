Useful Notation for Graph G on </p><h2>text</h2> <p>We collect in this section some notation that will be used throughout. For any event A, we let A be the complement of A. Also, for sets S a and S b , the relative complement of S a in S b is given by S a \\ S b .\nIn graph G on , for each node v i ∈ V, we define N i as the set of neighbors of node v i . For any two distinct nodes v x and v y , there are (n-2) nodes other than v x and v y in graph G on . These (n -2) nodes can be split into the four sets N xy , N xy , N xy and N x y as follows. Let N xy be the set of nodes that are neighbors of both v x and v y ; i.e., N xy = N x ∩ N y . Let N xy denote the set of nodes in V \\ {v x , v y } that are neighbors of v x , but are not neighbors of v y . Similarly, N xy is defined as the set of nodes in V \\ {v x , v y } that are not neighbors of v x , but are neighbors of v y . Finally, N x y is the set of nodes in V \\ {v x , v y } that are not connected to either v x or v y .\nFor any three distinct nodes v x , v y and v j , recalling that E xj (resp., E yj ) is the event that there exists a link between nodes v x (resp., v y ) and v j , we define\nE xj∩yj := E xj ∩ E yj , E xj∩yj := E xj ∩ E yj , E xj∩yj := E xj ∩ E yj , and E xj∩yj := E xj ∩ E yj .\nIn graph G on , for any non-negative integer ℓ, let X ℓ be the number of nodes having degree ℓ; let D x,ℓ be the event that node v x has degree ℓ. We define δ as the minimum node degree of graph G on , and define κ as the connectivity of graph G on . The connectivity of a graph is defined as the minimum number of nodes whose deletion renders the graph disconnected; thus, a graph is k-connected if and only if its connectivity is at least k. Finally, a graph is said to be simply connected if its connectivity is at least 1, i.e., if it is 1-connected. </p><h2>publication_ref</h2> <p>[] </p><h2>figure_ref</h2> <p>[] </p><h2>table_ref</h2> <p>[] </p><h2>heading</h2> <p>VI. ESTABLISHING (11) (THE ZERO-LAW FOR THE MINIMUM NODE DEGREE IN G on ) </p><h2>text</h2> <p>Our main goal in this section is to establish (11) under the following conditions: From property (c) of Fact 1, we see that the proof will be completed if we demonstrate the following two results under the conditions ( 45) and ( 46):\nlim n→∞ E X ℓ = +∞,(47)\nand\nE X ℓ 2 ∼ E X ℓ 2 . (48\n)\nfor some ℓ = 0, 1, . . . , k -1.\nThe first step in establishing (47) and ( 48) is to compute the moments E [X ℓ ] and E (X ℓ ) 2 . This step is taken in the next Lemma. Recall that in graph G on , X ℓ stands for the number of nodes with degree ℓ for each ℓ = 0, 1, . . .. Also, D x,ℓ is the event that node v x has degree ℓ for each x = 1, 2, . . . , n.\nLemma 1. In G on , for any non-negative integer ℓ and any two distinct nodes v x and v y , we have\nE X ℓ = nP [D x,ℓ ] ,(49)\nE X ℓ 2 = nP [D x,ℓ ] + n(n -1)P [D x,ℓ D y,ℓ ] . (50\n)\nLemma 1 follows from the exchangeability of the indicator random variables {1[D i,ℓ ]; i = 1, . . . , n} upon writing\nX ℓ = n i=1 1[D i,ℓ ].\nInterested reader is referred to the full version [41] for details.\nIn view of (49), we will obtain (47) once we show that\nlim n→+∞ (nP [D x,ℓ ]) = +∞.(51)\nunder (45) and (46). Also, from (49) and (50), we get\nE X ℓ 2 E X ℓ 2 = 1 nP [D x,ℓ ] + n -1 n • P [D x,ℓ D y,ℓ ] P [D\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>GRAPH G<|>CONCEPT<|>Graph G is a mathematical structure used to model pairwise relations between objects, consisting of nodes and edges that connect them.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>NODE DEGREE<|>CONCEPT<|>Node degree refers to the number of edges connected to a node in a graph, indicating its connectivity and importance within the graph structure.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CONNECTIVITY<|>CONCEPT<|>Connectivity is a property of a graph that describes the minimum number of nodes that need to be removed to disconnect the remaining nodes, indicating the robustness of the graph.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>E X ℓ<|>CONCEPT<|>E X ℓ represents the expected number of nodes in graph G that have a specific degree ℓ, which is a measure of the distribution of node degrees in the graph.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>D x,ℓ<|>CONCEPT<|>D x,ℓ is an event that indicates whether a specific node v x has a degree of ℓ, used in the analysis of node degree distributions in graph theory.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LIMITING BEHAVIOR<|>CONCEPT<|>Limiting behavior refers to the analysis of the behavior of a function or sequence as its argument approaches a particular value or infinity, often used in probability and statistics.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>GRAPH G<|>NODE DEGREE<|>Node degree is a fundamental property of graph G that describes the connectivity of its nodes<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>GRAPH G<|>CONNECTIVITY<|>Connectivity is a key characteristic of graph G that determines its resilience to node removal<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>E X ℓ<|>NODE DEGREE<|>E X ℓ is calculated based on the distribution of node degrees in graph G<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>D x,ℓ<|>NODE DEGREE<|>D x,ℓ is used to determine the degree of a specific node in graph G<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>LIMITING BEHAVIOR<|>E X ℓ<|>Limiting behavior is analyzed to understand the expected number of nodes with degree ℓ as the number of nodes in graph G approaches infinity<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>LIMITING BEHAVIOR<|>CONNECTIVITY<|>Limiting behavior can impact the connectivity of graph G as it grows<|>5)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
