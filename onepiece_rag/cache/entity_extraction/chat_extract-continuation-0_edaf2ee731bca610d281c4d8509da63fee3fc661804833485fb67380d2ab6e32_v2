In the link prediction task, we further have the following observations: (1) Compared with Euclidean 4 The results on Lorentz model are similar. counterparts, Our proposed ùúÖHGCN, and other hyperbolic models have achieved better performance. It is because hyperbolic space owns a larger embedding space, where the structural dependencies could be well preserved by the link prediction loss, providing more space or boundary for nodes to be well arranged; (2) In comparison with the advanced hyperbolic models, our model also obtains remarkable gains and refresh the records. According to the above extensive experiments, we are safe to conclude that equipping ORC with hyperbolic geometry further improves its generalization ability, obtaining high-quality representations for both tree-like and non-tree-like structured data. This confirms our primary motivation that the curvature carries rich information which is beneficial for graph representation learning in the embedding manifold. Specifically, incorporating the structure information featured by ORC helps the models developed in a continuous manifold with negative curvature to perceive the role of each node, accelerating the learning procedure, and reducing the distortion for graph embedding of less hierarchical networks. </p><h2>publication_ref</h2> <p>['b0', 'b77', 'b34', 'b82', 'b27', 'b1'] </p><h2>figure_ref</h2> <p>[] </p><h2>table_ref</h2> <p>['tab_3', 'tab_4', 'tab_3'] </p><h2>heading</h2> <p>Effectiveness of Aggregations </p><h2>text</h2> <p>In Section 4.1, we introduce two tangential aggregation strategies: the curvature-based approach (denoted as Curv) and the featureaugmented method (denoted as CurvAtt). The performance of  these two aggregation strategies is evaluated and reported in Table 5. Our results show that the feature-augmented approach outperforms the curvature-based one in most cases, which can be attributed to the complex nature of real-world systems and the incongruities between node features and topology. The feature-augmented method offers a more flexible and adaptive way to synthesize information from various sources, thus resulting in improved performance. </p><h2>publication_ref</h2> <p>[] </p><h2>figure_ref</h2> <p>[] </p><h2>table_ref</h2> <p>['tab_5'] </p><h2>heading</h2> <p>Effectiveness of ùúÖHC </p><h2>text</h2> <p>Figure 5 displays the results of adding ùúÖHC or not on ùúÖHGCN. As it observed, the performance degenerates substantially on DISEASE when applying ùúÖHC, while there are significant improvements on the three citation networks, i.e., PubMed, and Cora. This phenomenon can be understood as follows. Adding ùúÖHC as in node classification will force linked nodes to obtain more similar representations. For the pure tree-like dataset, i.e., DISEASE (without any triangle and circle), these node pairs belong to different levels, and adding ùúÖHC impairs the learning of asymmetric dependencies, which further affects the establishment of hierarchical awareness. When it comes to the citation networks instead, ùúÖHC helps to reduce the distortion caused by hyperbolic geometry and thus boost the learning. </p><h2>publication_ref</h2> <p>[] </p><h2>figure_ref</h2> <p>['fig_3'] </p><h2>table_ref</h2> <p>[] </p><h2>heading</h2> <p>Case Study of Ricci Curvature Weights </p><h2>text</h2> <p>In this section, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our method through a case study. We extract a subtree centered on a randomly sampled node (node 10, in this case), from the Disease dataset, where node 2 is from a higher level and the remaining nodes (42,43,44,45) belong to a lower level. The edges depict disease propagation paths. As shown in the upper sub-figures of Figure 6, we display the corresponding edge weights assigned by both ùúÖHGCN and HGCN during the node classification task. The comparison between the two reveals that ùúÖHGCN (upper right) effectively distinguishes node levels, as it assigns greater importance to the parent node (node 2) and equally emphasizes the child nodes from the same level, whereas HGCN (upper left) fails to make such distinctions. This substantiates the importance of ORC in facilitating hierarchical learning.\nFurthermore, we illustrate a subgraph with triangles selected from the citation network, Cora, as depicted in the lower two sub-figures of Figure 6. This subgraph comprises nodes ùëú, ùëí, ùëë that form a triangle. We examine the edge weights around node ùëú and present the results in the lower two sub-figures of Figure 6. Observing these results, it is evident that ùúÖHGCN (as shown in the lower right) effectively identifies the local triangle structure and assigns larger weights to promote inter-node message exchange. In contrast, HGCN (as depicted in the lower left) fails to grasp the intricate topology in this area. These observations further attest to the efficacy of our proposed method in uncovering local clusters and mitigating the distortions imposed by hyperbolic geometry. </p><h2>publication_ref</h2> <p>['b41\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>ùúÖHGCN<|>CONCEPT<|>ùúÖHGCN is a proposed hyperbolic model that achieves better performance in link prediction tasks by utilizing a larger embedding space to preserve structural dependencies.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>HGCN<|>CONCEPT<HGCN is a hyperbolic graph convolutional network that serves as a baseline for comparison with ùúÖHGCN in terms of performance in graph representation learning.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DISEASE<|>CONCEPT<|>DISEASE is a pure tree-like dataset used in node classification tasks, which presents challenges for learning asymmetric dependencies when applying ùúÖHC.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CITATION NETWORKS<|>CONCEPT<|>Citation networks, such as PubMed and Cora, are used to evaluate the performance of ùúÖHGCN and demonstrate significant improvements when applying ùúÖHC.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ORC<|>CONCEPT<|>ORC refers to the curvature-based approach that enhances the generalization ability of models in graph representation learning.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CURV<|>CONCEPT<|>CURV is a curvature-based aggregation strategy evaluated in the context of graph representation learning.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CURVATT<|>CONCEPT<|>CURVATT is a feature-augmented aggregation strategy that outperforms CURV in most cases due to its flexibility in synthesizing information.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SUBGRAPH<|>CONCEPT<|>A subgraph is a smaller graph extracted from a larger graph, used to analyze local structures and relationships among nodes.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>TRIANGLE STRUCTURE<|>CONCEPT<|>Triangle structure refers to a specific local topology in a graph where three nodes are interconnected, which is important for message exchange in graph learning.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ùúÖHGCN<|>HGCN<|>ùúÖHGCN is compared to HGCN to demonstrate improvements in performance for graph representation learning<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ùúÖHGCN<|>DISEASE<|>The performance of ùúÖHGCN degenerates on the DISEASE dataset due to its tree-like structure, affecting learning<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ùúÖHGCN<|>CITATION NETWORKS<|>ùúÖHGCN shows significant improvements on citation networks like PubMed and Cora<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ORC<|>ùúÖHGCN<|>ORC enhances the generalization ability of ùúÖHGCN in graph representation learning<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CURV<|>CURVATT<|>CURVATT outperforms CURV in most cases due to its adaptive synthesis of information<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SUBGRAPH<|>TRIANGLE STRUCTURE<|>The subgraph analysis includes examining triangle structures to understand local topology<|>5)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
