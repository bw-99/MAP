Comparing (30) with (9), we get lim n→∞ α n ± o(1) = -∞ and the zero law\nlim n→∞ P [G(n, K n , P n ) is k-connected ] = 0 follows from (10) of Theorem 1.\nWe now establish the one-law. Pick K n , P n such that (20) holds with lim n→∞ α n = +∞, P n = Ω(n) and K n ≥ 2 for all n sufficiently large. In view of [39, Lemma 6.1], there exists Kn , Pn such that Kn ≥ 2 for all n sufficiently large,\nKn ≤ K n and Pn = P n , n = 1, 2, . . . ,and\nK2 n Pn = ln n + (k -1) ln ln n + αn n , n = 1, 2, . . . ,(31)\nwith αn = O(ln n) and lim n→∞ αn = ∞. By an easy coupling argument, it is easy to check that\nP G(n, Kn , Pn ) is k-connected ≤ P [G(n, K n , P n ) is k-connected ] .\nTherefore, the one-law proof will be completed upon showing\nlim n→∞ P G(n, Kn , Pn ) is k-connected = 1.\nUnder (31) we have V.

Therefore, we have\n[G is k-connected ] ⊆\nMinimum node degree of G is no less than k and the inequality\nP [G is k-connected ] ≤ P Minimum node degree of G is no less than k follows immediately.\nIt is now clear that ( 11) implies ( 10) and ( 12) implies ( 13). Thus, in order to prove Theorem 1, we only need to show (11) under the conditions of case (a), and ( 12) under the conditions of case (b). </p><h2>publication_ref</h2> <p>['b28', 'b10'] </p><h2>figure_ref</h2> <p>[] </p><h2>table_ref</h2> <p>[] </p><h2>heading</h2> <p>B. Confining α n </p><h2>text</h2> <p>As seen in Section V-A, Theorem 1 will follow if we show (11) and (12) under the appropriate conditions. In this subsection, we show that the extra condition α n = o(ln n) can be introduced in the proof of (12). Namely, we will show that part (b) of Theorem 1 under\nα n = o(ln n) ⇒ part (b) of Theorem 1(32)\nWe write G on as G on (n, K n , P n , p n ) and remember that given K n , P n and p n , one can determine α n from (9); just use (7).\nAssume that part (b) of Theorem 1 holds under the extra condition α n = o(ln n). The desired result (32) will follow if we establish \nlim n→∞ P G(n, Kn , Pn , pn ) is k-connected = 1(33\nand that we have\nP[G on (n, Kn , Pn , pn ) is k-connected ] ≥ P[G on (n, Kn , Pn , pn ) is k-connected ].(38)\nNotice that Kn , Pn and pn satisfy all the conditions enforced by part (b) of Theorem 1 together with the extra condition αn = o(ln n). Thus, we get\nlim n→∞ P[G on (n, Kn , Pn , pn ) is k-connected ] = 1(39)\nby the initial assumption, and (33) follows immediately from (38) and (39). Therefore, given any Kn , Pn and pn as stated above, if we can show the existence of Kn , Pn and pn that satisfy ( 35)-( 38), then the desired conclusion (32) will follow. We now establish the existence of Kn , Pn and pn that satisfy ( 35)- (38). Let Pn = Pn and Kn = Kn so that ( 35) is satisfied automatically. Let αn = min { αn , ln ln n}. Hence, we have αn ≤ αn , αn = o(ln n) and lim n→∞ αn = +∞ so that ( 37) is also satisfied.
