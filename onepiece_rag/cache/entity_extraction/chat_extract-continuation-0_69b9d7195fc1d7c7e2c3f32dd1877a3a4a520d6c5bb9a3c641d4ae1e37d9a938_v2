Let m 1 , m 2 and m 3 be non-negative integer constants. We define event F as follows.\nF := [|N xy | = m 1 ] [|N xy | = m 2 ] [|N xy | = m 3 ] . (76\n)\nThen given u in {0, 1, . . . , K n } and p e = ln n+(k-1) ln ln n+αn n with lim n→∞ α n = -∞, we have\nP [F | (|S xy | = u)] ∼ n m1+m2+m3 m 1 !m 2 !m 3 ! • e -2pen+ pepn u Kn n × {P[E xj∩yj | (|S xy | = u)]} m1 × {P[E xj∩yj | (|S xy | = u)]} m2 × {P[E xj∩yj | (|S xy | = u)]} m3 (77)\nwith j distinct from x and y.\nA proof of Lemma 4 is given in Appendix C-B.\nGiven the definition of A h in (63) and K xy ⇔ (|S xy | = 0), we let m 1 = h, m 2 = m 3 = ℓh and u = 0 in Lemma 4 in order to compute P A h | K xy . We get\nP A h | K xy ∼ n 2ℓ-h h![(ℓ -h)!] 2 • e -2pen • P[E xj∩yj | K xy ] h × {P[E xj∩yj | K xy ]} ℓ-h {P[E xj∩yj | K xy ]} ℓ-h . (78)\nIn order to compute the R.H.S. of (78), we evaluate the following three terms in turn:\nP[E xj∩yj | K xy ], P[E xj∩yj | K xy ], and P[E xj∩yj | K xy ].\nFor the first term\nP[E xj∩yj | K xy ], we use E xj = K xj ∩ C xj and E yj = K yj ∩ C yj to obtain P[E xj∩yj | K xy ] = P[(C xj ∩ C yj ) ∩ (K xj ∩ K yj ) | K xy ]. = p n 2 • P[K xj ∩ K yj | K xy ](79)\nApplying Lemma 9 (Appendix A-B) to (79) and using the definition p e = p n p s , we get\nP[E xj∩yj | K xy ] ≤ p e 2 . (80\n)\nWe now evaluate the second term\nP[E xj∩yj | K xy ]. It is clear that E xj is independent of K xy . Hence, P[E xj | K xy ] = p e .(81)\nSince p e = ln n+(k-1) ln ln n+αn n with lim n→∞ α n = -∞, we have p e = o 1 √ n . Together with (80), (81) this yields\nP[E xj∩yj | K xy ] = P[E xj | K xy ] -P[E xj∩yj | K xy ] = p e -O p e 2 ∼ p e .(82)\nSimilarly, for the third term P[E xj∩yj | K xy ], we have\nP[E xj∩yj | K xy ] ∼ p e .(83)\nNow we compute the R.H.S. of (78). Substituting (82) and (83) into R.H.S. of (78), given constant ℓ, we obtain\nP A h | K xy ∼ n 2ℓ-h h![(ℓ -h)!] 2 • e -2pen • P[E xj∩yj | K xy ] h • p 2(ℓ-h) e . (84\n)\nfor each h = 0, 1, . . . , ℓ.
