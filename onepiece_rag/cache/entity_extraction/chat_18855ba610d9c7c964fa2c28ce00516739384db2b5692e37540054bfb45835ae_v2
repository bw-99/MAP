We can observe that the performance of paper2repo gradually increases as ∆ rises from 0.1 to 0.4, and then gradually drops as ∆ increases from 0.4 to 0.7. This is to say, when ∆ = 0.4, it performs best among them. The main reason is that as margin ∆ is too small, it is hard to separate the positive and negative examples. At the same time, a larger ∆ may result in higher loss during training. Effect of Number of Bridge Papers. Finally, we explore how the number of bridge papers and repositories affect the recommendation performance of paper2repo. Table6illustrates the comparison results under different ratios of 1, 386 bridge papers in the small data set. We can observe from it that the evaluation metrics, HR, MAP and HRR, gradually rise as the number of bridge papers increases. This is because more bridge papers and repositories can make the embeddings of the similar nodes closer to each other in the graph.<h2>figure_data</h2><h2>figure_label</h2>6<h2>figure_type</h2>table<h2>figure_id</h2>tab_7<h2>figure_caption</h2>Performance comparison for different number of bridge papers when K = 10.<h2>figure_data</h2>Ratio0.40.60.81.0MAP 0.298 0.314 0.341 0.399MRR 0.325 0.364 0.391 0.460HR0.339 0.369 0.379 0.4664.6 Discussion of paper2repo<h1>formulas</h1><h2>formula_id</h2>formula_0<h2>formula_text</h2>H (l +1) = σ D-1 2 Ã D-1 2 H (l ) W (l ) ,(1)<h2>formula_coordinates</h2>[3.0, 113.86, 631.02, 180.19, 12.92]<h2>formula_id</h2>formula_1<h2>formula_text</h2>x 1:n = x 1 ⊕ x 2 ⊕ . . . ⊕ x n ,(2)<h2>formula_coordinates</h2>[4.0, 390.29, 120.67, 167.92, 9.89]<h2>formula_id</h2>formula_2<h2>formula_text</h2>c i = f (w.x i:i+h-1 + b),(3)<h2>formula_coordinates</h2>[4.0, 395.55, 205.41, 162.65, 10.4]<h2>formula_id</h2>formula_3<h2>formula_text</h2>c = [c 1 , c 2 , . . . , c n-h+1 ].(4)<h2>formula_coordinates</h2>[4.\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}}
