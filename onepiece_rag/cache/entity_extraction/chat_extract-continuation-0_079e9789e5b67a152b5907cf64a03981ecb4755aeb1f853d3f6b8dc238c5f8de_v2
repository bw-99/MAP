The (i, j)th cell of R is filled with user i's rating on item j if it exists; otherwise it is empty. A total number of 35416 ratings are included in R, whose values are between 0.5 and 4; and the empty cells of R are missing values to be predicted. The matrix T e is sparse in that only 1642 cells of it are filled with value 1 associated with a set of trust statements and the other cells are empty, corresponding to missing values to be predicted. </p><h2>publication_ref</h2> <p>[] </p><h2>figure_ref</h2> <p>[] </p><h2>table_ref</h2> <p>[] </p><h2>heading</h2> <p>Experiment setting </p><h2>text</h2> <p>The comparison methods include the traditional CF algorithm, which uses the Pearson correlation as the similarity measure, an explicit trust based TaCF (called E-TaCF for short in what follows) and a Dijkstra's algorithm based TaCF (termed D-TaCF for short in what follows) proposed in [26]. The traditional CF is included here as a baseline for performance comparison. The E-TaCF algorithm can be regarded as a simplified version of iTrace that discards the whole implicit trust inference procedure, namely, it sets T straightforward to be T e prior to the calculation of Eqn. (3). We consider two types of E-TaCF, E-TaCF-I and E-TaCF-II, corresponding to the usage of Eqn.(4) and of Eqn. (5), respectively, for fusion of similarity and trust. The missing values in T e are filled with 0 when performing E-TaCF. This E-TaCF algorithm is included here in order to demonstrate the value of the proposed implicit trust procedure. The D-TaCF is involved here as it is the most similar method in the literature to our iTrace algorithm. For iTrace and E-TaCF, we consider the IW and LW weighting mechanisms both, corresponding to Eqns.( 4) and ( 5), respectively, and the aim is to investigate which one is better for use. Apart from Eqn. (7), we also considered another way to calculate t(u, v) by\nt(u, v) = 1/L(SP r (u, v)). (9\n)\nThe purpose is to demonstrate that taking account of the attenuation feature of trust via Eqn.( 7) is beneficial for improving accuracy in recommendations. To summarize, we considered in total 4 types of iTrace as shown in Table 1.  </p><h2>publication_ref</h2> <p>['b25', 'b2', 'b4', 'b6'] </p><h2>figure_ref</h2> <p>[] </p><h2>table_ref</h2> <p>['tab_1'] </p><h2>heading</h2> <p>Experiment results </p><h2>text</h2> <p>In our experiment, the number of voting users K takes values in 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45, and for every K value, a cross validation type test for every comparison method is performed. We partition the sample of rating data into two complementary subsets, perform the user similarity analysis on one subset, which occupies 80% of the whole dataset, hiding the other 20% ratings and trying to predict them. The predicted rating is then compared with the real rating and the difference (in absolute value) is the prediction error. The mean absolute error (MAE) is adopted as the performance measure.\nTo reduce variability, we perform 5 rounds of the above operations using different partitions for each algorithm, and the prediction results are averaged over the rounds.
