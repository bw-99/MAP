(123\n)\nSince α n = o(ln n) and lim n→∞ α n = +∞, we have for each ℓ = 0, 1, . . . , k -1 that\nlim n→∞ β ℓ,n = +∞ and β ℓ,n = o(ln n).(124)\nGiven (124), we use Lemma 5 and obtain\nlim n→∞ P [κ = ℓ] = 0, ℓ = 0, 1, . . . , k -1.\nFor any constant k, this implies lim n→∞ P [κ ≥ k] = 1, or equivalently\nlim n→∞ P [G on is k-connected ] = 1.\nThis completes the proof of the one-law (12). The remaining part of this section is devoted to the proof of Lemma 5. Proof. We present the steps of proving Lemma 5 below. First, by a crude bounding argument, we get\nP [κ = ℓ] ≤ P [(κ = ℓ) ∩ (δ > ℓ)] + P [δ ≤ ℓ] ,\nwhere δ is the minimum node degree of graph G on , as defined in Section V-D. We will prove Lemma 5 by establishing the following two results under the enforced assumptions:\nlim n→∞ P [δ ≤ ℓ] = 0 if lim n→∞ β ℓ,n = +∞,(125)\nand\nlim n→∞ P [κ = ℓ ∩ δ > ℓ] = 0 if lim n→∞ β ℓ,n = +∞.(126)\nWe first establish (125). First, from ℓ ln ln n = o(ln n), β ℓ,n = o(ln n) and p e = ln n+ℓ ln ln n+β ℓ,n n\n, it is clear that p e ∼ ln n n . Then p e = o 1 √ n . Thus, from Lemmas 1 and 2, we get\nE X ℓ = nP [D x,ℓ ] ∼ n • (ℓ!) -1 (p e n) ℓ e -pen .(127)\nSubstituting p e ∼ ln n n and (120) into (127), we get\nE X ℓ ∼ n (ℓ!) -1 (ln n) ℓ e -ln n-ℓ ln ln n-β ℓ,n = (ℓ!) -1 e -β ℓ,n .\nIn view of the fact that lim n→∞ β ℓ,n = +∞, we thus obtain E X ℓ = o(1). Then from property (a) of Fact 1 (Section V-C), we get\nlim n→∞ P[δ = ℓ] = 0.(128)\nAs seen from ( 121), β ℓ,n is decreasing in ℓ. Thus, we have\nlim n→∞ β ℓ ⋆ ,n = +∞ for each ℓ ⋆ = 0, 1, . . . , ℓ. It is also im- mediate from (121) that β ℓ ⋆ ,n = o(ln n) since β ℓ,n = o(ln n).\nTherefore, using the same arguments that lead to (128), we obtain\nlim n→∞ P[δ = ℓ ⋆ ] = 0, ℓ ⋆ = 0, 1, . . . , ℓ,\nand (125) follows immediately. As ( 125) is established, it remains to prove (126) in order to complete the proof of Lemma 5. The basic idea in establishing ( 126) is to find a sufficiently tight upper bound on the probability P [κ = ℓ ∩ δ > ℓ] and then to show that this bound tends to zero as n goes to +∞. This approach is similar to the one used for proving the one-law for k-connectivity in Erdős-Rényi graphs [12], as well as to the approach used by Yagan [37] to establish the one-law for connectivity in the graph G on .\nWe start by obtaining the needed upper bound. Let N denote the collection of all non-empty subsets of {v 1 , . . . , v n }. We define\nN * = {T | T ∈ N , |T | ≥ 2} and K T = ∪ vi∈T S i .\nFor the reasons that will later become apparent we find it useful to introduce the event E(J ) in the following manner:\nE(J ) = T ∈N * |K T | ≤ J |T | ,(129)\nwhere J = [J 2 , J 3 , . . . , J n ] is an (n -1)-dimensional integer valued array. Let\nr n := min P n K n , n 2 . (130\n)\nWe define J i as follows:\nJ i = max{⌊(1 + ε)K n ⌋ , ⌊λK n i⌋} i = 2, . . . , r n , ⌊µP n ⌋ i = r n + 1, . . . , n.(131)\nfor some arbitrary constant 0 < ε < 1 and constants λ, µ in (0, 1 2 ) that will be specified later; see (134)-(135) below. By a crude bounding argument we now get\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}}
