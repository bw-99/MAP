That is, if\n∃t with 0 < t ≤ D k and C k + τi∈hp(τ k ) t T i C i ≤ t,(44)\nthen task τ k is schedulable under the fixed-priority scheduling algorithm, where hp(τ k ) is the set of tasks with higher priority than τ k , D k , C k , and T i represent τ k 's relative deadline, worst-case execution time, and period, respectively. For a constrained-deadline task τ k , the schedulability test in Eq. ( 44) is equivalent to the verification of the existence of 0 < t ≤ D k such that\nC k + τi∈hp2(τ k ) C i + τi∈hp1(τ k ) t T i C i ≤ t.(45)\nWe can then create a virtual sporadic task τ k with execution time\nC k = C k + τi∈hp2(τ k ) C i , relative deadline D k = D k , and period T k = D k .\nIt is clear that the schedulability test to verify the schedulability of task τ k under the interference of the higher-priority tasks hp 1 (τ k ) is the same as that of task τ k under the interference of the higher-priority tasks hp(τ k ).\nFor notational brevity, suppose that there are k * -1 tasks in hp 1 (τ k ).\nTheorem 7.

Task τ k in a sporadic task system with implicit deadlines is schedulable by the RM scheduling algorithm if Lemmas 1, 3, 4, or 5 holds by setting C k t k as U k , α = 1, and β = 1.\nThe above result in Corollary 2 leads to the utilization bound 2 -√ 2 (by using Lemma 5 with α = 1 and β = 1) for RM scheduling, which is worse than the existing Liu and Layland bound ln 2 [39]. </p><h2>publication_ref</h2> <p>['b18', 'b39', 'b37', 'b39', 'b37', 'b34', 'b38'] </p><h2>figure_ref</h2> <p>[] </p><h2>table_ref</h2> <p>[] </p><h2>heading</h2> <p>Appendix C: Multiprocessor DM/RM Scheduling </p><h2>text</h2> <p>This part demonstrates how to use the k 2 Q framework for multiprocessor global fixed-priority scheduling. We consider that the system has M identical processors. For global fixedpriority scheduling, there is a global queue and a global scheduler to dispatch jobs. We demonstrate the applicability for constrained-deadline and implicit-deadline sporadic systems under global fixed-priority scheduling. Specifically, we will present how to apply the framework to obtain speed-up and capacity augmentation factors for global DM and global RM.\nThe success of the scheme depends on a corresponding exponential-time test. Here we will use the property to be presented in Lemma 9, based on the forced-forward algorithm proposed by Baruah et al. [7] to characterize the workload of higher-priority tasks. The method in [7] to analyze fixedpriority scheduling is completely different from ours, as they rely on the demand bound functions of the tasks.\nThe following lemma provides a sufficient test based on the observations by Baruah et al. [7]. The construction of the following lemma is based on a minor change of the forcedforward algorithm.\nLemma 9.
