A key novelty of k 2 Q that allows a rather general analysis framework is that we do not specifically seek for the total utilization bound. Instead, we look for the critical value in the specified sufficient schedulability test while verifying the schedulability of task τ k . This critical value of task τ k gives the difficulty of task τ k to be schedulable under the scheduling policy. We present several properties of k 2 Q, which provide a series of closed-form solutions to be adopted for sufficient tests and worst-case response time analyses for real-time task models, as long as a corresponding k-point last-release schedulability test (Definition 2) or a k-point last-release responsetime analysis (Definition 3) can be constructed. The generality of k 2 Q is supported by demonstrating that either new or better results compared to the state-of-the-art can be easily obtained using k 2 Q. Examples include:\n• Several utilization-based schedulability and response analyses for uniprocessor sporadic task systems are provided in Section 5 The utilization-based worst-case response-time analysis in Theorem 4 in Section 5 is identical to the response-time analysis by Bini et al. [15] developed in parallel. ≈ 2.823 for implicit-deadline sporadic task systems, which improves upon the existing best speed-up factor 3 presented in [10].\n• We provide, to the best of our knowledge, the first polynomial-time worst-case response time analysis for sporadic real-time tasks with jitters [3], [9] in Appendix D.\n• We also demonstrate how to convert exponential-time schedulability tests of generalized multi-frame task models [8], [46] to polynomial-time tests by using the k 2 Q framework in Appendix E. • The above results are for task-level fixed-priority scheduling policies. We further explore mode-level fixed-priority scheduling policies by studying the acyclic task model [1] and the multi-mode task model [24]. 1 We conclude a quadratic bound and a utilization bound 2 -√ 2 for RM scheduling policy. The utilization bound is the same as the result in [1]. They can be further generalized to handle more generalized task models, including the digraph task model [44], the recurring real-time task model [6]. This is presented in Appendix F.\nThe emphasis of this paper is to show the generality of the k 2 Q framework by demonstrating via several task models. The tests and analytical results in the framework are with low complexity, but can still be shown to provide good results through speed-up factor or utilization bound analyses. We also note a somehow surprising finding through developing this framework: in the past, exponential-time schedulability tests were typically not recommended and most of time ignored, as this requires very high complexity. We have successfully shown in this paper that exponential-time schedulability tests may lead to good polynomial-time tests (almost automatically) by using the k 2 Q framework. Therefore, this framework may also open the possibility to re-examine some tests with exponentialtime complexity to improve their applicability. </p><h2>publication_ref</h2> <p>['b14', 'b9', 'b2', 'b8', 'b7', 'b45', 'b0', 'b23', 'b0', 'b43', 'b5'] </p><h2>figure_ref</h2> <p>[] </p><h2>table_ref</h2> <p>[] </p><h2>heading</h2> <p>Basic Task and Scheduling Models </p><h2>text</h2> <p>This section presents the sporadic real-time task model, as the basis for our presentations.

A sporadic task τ i is released repeatedly, with each such invocation called a job. The j th job of τ i , denoted τ i,j , is released at time r i,j and has an absolute deadline at time d i,j . Each job of any task τ i is assumed to have execution time C i .
