Indeed, the curve corresponding to the uniform distribution and the Lebesgue area measure dx 1 dx 2 is symmetric. Also, in this case, po(x 1 , x 1 ) = x 1 x 2 , and the sets of at least k-Pareto optimal elements are the sets situated below arcs of hyperbola defined by the equation x 1 x 2 = k, see Sections 4.2 and 4.2.1 for more details. Applying rarefaction with respect to x 2 prioritises smaller values of this characteristic. This is represented by shifting upwards the right part of the hyperbola arc, see the curve for 2x 2 dx 1 dx 2 . Indeed, in this case, the small values of x 2 are observed less often. This results in selecting additional elements with large values of x 1 but relatively small values of x 2 to compensate for this rarefaction. Finally, rarefaction with respect to both x 1 and x 2 results in the fact that the small values of both characteristics are observed less often. Thus, elements with larger values of x 1 and x 2 should be selected to generate a selection of the required measure. It results in the shift of the hyperbola upwards following the direction of the main diagonal, see the curve for 4x 1 x 2 dx 1 dx 2 .  <h2>publication_ref</h2>[]<h2>figure_ref</h2>[]<h2>table_ref</h2>[]<h1>references</h1><h2>ref_id</h2>b0<h2>title</h2><h2>journal</h2><h2>year</h2>2010<h2>authors</h2> Croft<h2>ref_id</h2>b1<h2>title</h2>Search engines: Information retrieval in practice<h2>journal</h2>Addison-Wesley Reading<h2>year</h2>2010<h2>authors</h2>W B Croft; D Metzler; T Strohman<h2>ref_id</h2>b2<h2>title</h2><h2>journal</h2><h2>year</h2>1957<h2>authors</h2> Dantzig<h2>ref_id</h2>b3<h2>title</h2>Discretevariable extremum problems<h2>journal</h2>Operations research<h2>year</h2>1957<h2>authors</h2>G B Dantzig<h2>ref_id</h2>b4<h2>title</h2><h2>journal</h2><h2>year</h2>2002<h2>authors</h2>Priestley Davey<h2>ref_id</h2>b5<h2>title</h2>Introduction to lattices and order<h2>journal</h2>Cambridge university press<h2>year</h2>2002<h2>authors</h2>B A Davey; H A Priestley<h2>ref_id</h2>b6<h2>title</h2><h2>journal</h2><h2>year</h2>2010<h2>authors</h2> De Loof<h2>ref_id</h2>b7<h2>title</h2>Efficient computation of rank probabilities in posets<h2>journal</h2><h2>year</h2>2010<h2>authors</h2>K De Loof<h2>ref_id</h2>b8<h2>title</h2><h2>journal</h2><h2>year</h2>2013<h2>authors</h2>Deb ; Jain <h2>ref_id</h2>b9<h2>title</h2>An evolutionary many-objective optimization algorithm using reference-point-based nondominated sorting approach, part i: solving problems with box constraints<h2>journal</h2>IEEE transactions on evolutionary computation<h2>year</h2>2013<h2>authors</h2>K Deb; H Jain<h2>ref_id</h2>b10<h2>title</h2><h2>journal</h2><h2>year</h2>2002<h2>authors</h2>Deb <h2>ref_id</h2>b11<h2>title</h2>A fast and elitist multiobjective genetic algorithm: Nsga-ii<h2>journal</h2>IEEE transactions on evolutionary computation<h2>year</h2>2002<h2>authors</h2>K Deb; A Pratap; S Agarwal; T Meyarivan<h2>ref_id</h2>b12<h2>title</h2><h2>journal</h2><h2>year</h2>2013<h2>authors</h2>Durante <h2>ref_id</h2>b13<h2>title</h2>A topological proof of sklar's theorem<h2>journal</h2>Applied Mathematics Letters<h2>year</h2>2013<h2>authors</h2>F Durante; J Fernandez-Sanchez; C Sempi<h2>ref_id</h2>b14<h2>title</h2><h2>journal</h2><h2>year</h2>1997<h2>authors</h2>E Knuth<h2>ref_id</h2\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}}
