A significant weakness of this greedy selection is that, by its nature, ANN search will return items that are similar not only to the user embedding, but also to each other; this drastically reduces the diversity of the returned items. This reduction in diversity is a side-effect of the way embeddings are trained -typically, the goal of training embeddings is to put users and relevant items close in Euclidean space; however, this also places similar users close in space, as well as similar items. We will repeatedly exploit this \"locality implies similarity\" property of embeddings in this paper to resolve this diversity issue.\nClustering Items: Since neighboring items are similar in the embedding space, if we apply a distance-based clustering to items, we can arrive at groupings that represent individual user preferences well. As such, we first cluster items using spherical k-means [6] where cluster centroids are placed on a high-dimensional sphere with radius one. Given these item clusters, instead of immediately collapsing the distribution p(i k |u j ) to a few items as ANN search does, we can write the full distribution p(i k |u j ) as a mixture over item clusters:\np(i k |u j ) = c p(c|u j ) • p(i k |u j , c)\nwhere in each cluster, we learn a separate distribution over the items in the cluster p(i k |u j , c). Thus, we are modeling each user's higher level interests p(c|u), and then within each interest c, we can apply an efficient ANN-search strategy as before. In effect, we are interpolating between sampling the full preference distribution p(i k |u j ) and greedily selecting a few items in an ANN. </p><h2>publication_ref</h2> <p>['b5'] </p><h2>figure_ref</h2> <p>[] </p><h2>table_ref</h2> <p>[] </p><h2>heading</h2> <p>Mixture of Embeddings via Cluster Engagements: </p><h2>text</h2> <p>After clustering target entities, we learn p(c|u j ) through its maximum likelihood estimator (MLE):\np mle (c|u j ) = count(u i , c)/ c ′ ∈Mj count(u j , c ′ )(3)\nwhere, count(u j , c) is the number of times u j has a relevant item in cluster c. For computational efficiency, we take M j to be u j 's top m most relevant clusters. We normalize these counts to obtain a proper cluster-relevance distribution.\nNearest Neighbor Smoothing: Unfortunately, we typically have few user-item engagements on a per-user basis; thus, while the MLE is unbiased and asymptotically efficient, it can also be high variance. To this end, we introduce a smoothing technique that once again exploits locality in the ANN search, this time for users. Figure 1 illustrates identifying k nearest-neighbors (K j ) to the query user u j 's, and leveraging the information from the neighbors' cluster engagements to augment the user's cluster relevance. We compute this distribution over item clusters by averaging the MLE probability for each nearest neighbor (item clusters that are not engaged with by a retrieved neighbor have zero probability).\np k N N (c|u j ) = 1 |K j | u ′ ∈Kj p mle (c|u ′ )(4)\nWe apply Jelinik-Mercer smoothing to interpolate between a user's MLE distribution with the aggregated nearest neighbor distribution [12].\np smoothed (c|u j ) = (1 -λ)p mle (c|u j ) + λp k N N (c|u j ),(5)\nwhere λ ∈ [0, 1] represents how much smoothing is applied. It can be manually set or tuned on a downstream extrinsic task. Fig. 1: Example of retrieving two candidates. In an ANN, items 4 and 5 would be deterministically returned for user 1. In our proposed kNN-Embed, even though the distances to cluster 2 are larger, smoothing means that we will sometimes return items from that cluster, yielding more diverse items. Note in this case, we don't even require that user 1 has previously relevant items in cluster 2.\nSampling within Clusters Within each cluster there are many ways to retrieve items on a per user basis. A simple, but appealing, strategy is to represent each user as a normalized centroid of their relevant items in that cluster:\ncentroid(c, u j ) = m∈R(c,uj ) i m ∥ m∈R(c,uj ) i m ∥ ,(6)\nwhere R(c, u j ) is the set of relevant items for user u j in cluster c. However, since we are applying smoothing to the cluster probabilities p(c|u j ), it may be case that u j has zero relevant items in a given cluster. Hence, we smooth the user centroid using neighbor infomation to obtain the final user representation u c j :\nu c j = (1 -λ) centroid(c, u j ) + λ |K j | u ′ ∈Kj p mle (c|u ′ ) centroid(c, u ′ )(7)\nEquation 7 shows the kNN-smoothed user-specific embedding for cluster c. This embedding takes the user-specific cluster representations from Equation 6, and performs a weighted averaging proportionate to each user's contribution to p smoothed (c|u j ). The final vector is once again normalized to unit norm. </p><h2>publication_ref</h2> <\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>ANN SEARCH<|>CONCEPT<|>ANN search is a method used to find the top relevant items based on user embeddings, but it has a weakness in reducing diversity among returned items due to similarity in the embedding space.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>USER EMBEDDING<|>CONCEPT<|>User embedding is a representation of user preferences in a high-dimensional space, used to find relevant items through similarity.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SPHERICAL K-MEANS<|>CONCEPT<|>Spherical k-means is a clustering algorithm that groups items based on their positions on a high-dimensional sphere, helping to represent user preferences effectively.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DIVERSITY ISSUE<|>CONCEPT<|>The diversity issue refers to the problem where ANN search returns similar items, reducing the variety of options available to users.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MIXTURE OF EMBEDDINGS<|>CONCEPT<|>Mixture of embeddings is a method that combines user preferences and item clusters to improve the selection of relevant items while maintaining diversity.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MAXIMUM LIKELIHOOD ESTIMATOR<|>CONCEPT<|>The maximum likelihood estimator (MLE) is a statistical method used to estimate the probability distribution of user preferences based on item engagement counts.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>JELINIK-MERCER SMOOTHING<|>CONCEPT<|>Jelinik-Mercer smoothing is a technique used to adjust probability distributions to reduce variance in user-item engagement data.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>KNN-EMBED<|>CONCEPT<|>KNN-Embed is a proposed method that enhances item retrieval by leveraging information from nearest neighbors to improve diversity in recommendations.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>USER<|>CONCEPT<|>A user is an individual whose preferences are represented in the embedding space and who engages with items in the system.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>USER EMBEDDING<|>ANN SEARCH<|>User embedding is utilized in ANN search to find relevant items based on user preferences<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>DIVERSITY ISSUE<|>ANN SEARCH<|>The diversity issue arises from the nature of ANN search, which tends to return similar items, reducing the variety<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SPHERICAL K-MEANS<|>MIXTURE OF EMBEDDINGS<|>Spherical k-means is used in the mixture of embeddings to cluster items based on user preferences<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MAXIMUM LIKELIHOOD ESTIMATOR<|>MIXTURE OF EMBEDDINGS<|>The maximum likelihood estimator is used to learn user preferences in the context of the mixture of embeddings<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>JELINIK-MERCER SMOOTHING<|>MAXIMUM LIKELIHOOD ESTIMATOR<|>Jelinik-Mercer smoothing is applied to the maximum likelihood estimator to reduce variance in user-item engagement<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>KNN-EMBED<|>DIVERSITY ISSUE<|>KNN-Embed addresses the diversity issue by incorporating information from nearest neighbors to enhance item retrieval<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>USER<|>USER EMBEDDING<|>Users are represented in the embedding space through user embeddings, which capture their preferences<|>9)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
