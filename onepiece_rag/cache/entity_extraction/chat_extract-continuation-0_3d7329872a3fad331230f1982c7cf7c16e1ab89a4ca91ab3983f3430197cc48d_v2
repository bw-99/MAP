Although AdaFS-hard attempts to mask unimportant fields by uniformly keeping the top ùêæ features, the trained feature weights may still exhibit a high variance pattern (remember the non-distinguishable probabilities in Figure 3, left panel). Therefore, this top ùêæ selection manner may lead to selecting unimportant features or omitting the important feature in their final model, further compromising the model performance. Our polarization regularizer and threshold searcher can help with this issue, as detailed in Section 3.3.3 and evidenced by the empirical ablation study in Section 4.7.\nLastly, other baselines apply global feature/dimension selection across all samples, which fails to account for inherent variations among heterogeneous individuals, and consequently leads to suboptimal performance. Additionally, PEP mainly emphasizes on the model size, i.e., it stops searching once the embedding table reaches a predefined parameter size. This approach may result in a suboptimal embedding table due to overlooking the model performance. AutoFieldfoot_1 also employs the top ùêæ selection manner, again leading to feature misselection and inferior model performance. </p><h2>publication_ref</h2> <p>['b14', 'b32', 'b15', 'b7', 'b12'] </p><h2>figure_ref</h2> <p>['fig_2'] </p><h2>table_ref</h2> <p>[] </p><h2>heading</h2> <p>Transferability Analysis (RQ2) </p><h2>text</h2> <p>In this subsection, we explore the transferability of iHAS. Specifically, we freeze the parameters of the well-trained Bernoulli gates and utilize them to help train other popular deep recommendation models, including FM [26], W&D [4], and DeepFM [8].\nTable 3 shows the experimental results on Avazu, where \"original\" refers to the corresponding model without any selection. We can observe that: (i) all the recommendation models have great improvement by adopting iHAS, which again demonstrates the importance of performing selection in the recommendations; (ii) The transferability of iHAS is better than the best baseline (by comparing the iHAS and AdaFS-soft in Table 3), which validates the effectiveness of our Bernoulli gates.\nIn summary, we conclude that iHAS has outstanding transferability across different recommendation models, which enables it to be leveraged in complicated real-world recommender systems. </p><h2>publication_ref</h2> <p>['b25', 'b3', 'b7'] </p><h2>figure_ref</h2> <p>[] </p><h2>table_ref</h2> <p>['tab_4', 'tab_4'] </p><h2>heading</h2> <p>Ablation Study (RQ3) </p><h2>text</h2> <p>In this subsection, we conduct the ablation study of key components in iHAS, as shown in Table 4. The Base model keeps all fields and the uniform embedding dimensions without any selections, and we derive four variants from iHAS: (i) iHAS-1: This variant is the model directly obtained in the searching stage, i.e., we remove the clustering and retraining stages; (ii) iHAS-2: This variant consists of a searching stage and a retraining stage. After we have the welltrained Bernoulli gates, we select dimensions across all samples to retrain one recommender model instead of separating samples into different clusters for retraining cluster-customized recommender models; (iii) iHAS-3: This variant is the standard iHAS without using the polarization regularizer described in Section 3. initialized vector of the dimension length, making every sample share the same probability for every dimension.\nBased on the results in Table 4, we can find: (i) iHAS and its variants can increase the AUC and decrease the Logloss compared with the Base model, which indicates the necessity of performing selection on embedding dimensions for boosting model performance; (ii) iHAS performs better than iHAS-1, which indicates the necessity of the subsequent clustering and retraining stages; (iii) iHAS-1 outperforms iHAS-2, therefore, separating instances into different groups, i.e., the clustering stage, is beneficial for boosting the performance; (iv) Polarization is vital for acquiring better Bernoulli gates by comparing iHAS with iHAS-3; (v) Respecting the difference between instances can further boost the performance by comparing iHAS with iHAS-4. </p><h2>publication_ref</h2> <p>[] </p><h2>figure_ref</h2> <p>[] </p><h2>table_ref</h2> <p>['tab_5', 'tab_5'] </p><h2>heading</h2> <p>Efficiency Analysis (RQ4) </p><h2>text</h2> <p>In addition to model performance, efficiency is vital when deploying the recommendation model into online systems, especially inference efficiency. We report the inference time on the whole test set of iHAS and other baselines in Figure 4. We can find that iHAS achieves the least inference time. This is because iHAS feed different test data into its preferred recommender model of smaller size instead of feeding all test data into a single model which may lead to additional inference cost on some data. On the contrary, PEP requires the longest inference time because its embedding table is usually sparse and hardware-unfriendly. </p><h2>publication_ref</h2> <p>[] </p><h\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>ADAFS-HARD<|>CONCEPT<|>AdaFS-hard is a method that attempts to mask unimportant fields by uniformly keeping the top K features, but may still exhibit high variance in feature weights.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>POLARIZATION REGULARIZER<|>CONCEPT<|>The polarization regularizer is a technique designed to improve model performance by addressing issues related to feature selection.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>THRESHOLD SEARCHER<|>CONCEPT<|>The threshold searcher is a tool that aids in selecting important features to enhance model performance.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PEP<|>CONCEPT<|>PEP is a method that emphasizes model size and stops searching once a predefined parameter size is reached, potentially leading to suboptimal performance.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>AUTOFIELD<|>CONCEPT<|>AutoField is a method that employs top K selection for feature selection, which may result in feature misselection.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>IHAS<|>CONCEPT<|>iHAS is a model that demonstrates outstanding transferability across different recommendation models, enhancing performance in real-world recommender systems.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>FM<|>CONCEPT<|>FM refers to Factorization Machines, a popular deep recommendation model that can benefit from the transferability of iHAS.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>W&D<|>CONCEPT<|>W&D is a deep recommendation model that can utilize the well-trained Bernoulli gates from iHAS for improved performance.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DEEPFM<|>CONCEPT<|>DeepFM is another deep recommendation model that can leverage the transferability of iHAS to enhance its performance.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ABLACTION STUDY<|>EVENT<|>The ablation study is an experimental analysis conducted to evaluate the key components of iHAS and their impact on model performance.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>TRANSFERABILITY ANALYSIS<|>EVENT<|>The transferability analysis explores how well iHAS can be applied to other recommendation models, demonstrating its effectiveness.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>EFFICIENCY ANALYSIS<|>EVENT<|>The efficiency analysis assesses the inference time and performance of iHAS compared to other baseline models.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ADAFS-HARD<|>POLARIZATION REGULARIZER<|>The polarization regularizer addresses the high variance issues that may arise from the AdaFS-hard method<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>POLARIZATION REGULARIZER<|>THRESHOLD SEARCHER<|>Both the polarization regularizer and threshold searcher are tools designed to improve feature selection and model performance<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PEP<|>AUTOFIELD<|>PEP and AutoField both utilize a top K selection method, which can lead to suboptimal model performance<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>IHAS<|>FM<|>iHAS can enhance the performance of the FM model by providing well-trained Bernoulli gates<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>IHAS<|>W&D<|>iHAS improves the W&D model's performance through the application of its transferability<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>IHAS<|>DEEPFM<|>iHAS can be leveraged to enhance the performance of the DeepFM model<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ABLACTION STUDY<|>IHAS<|>The ablation study evaluates the key components of iHAS and their impact on its performance<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>TRANSFERABILITY ANALYSIS<|>IHAS<|>The transferability analysis demonstrates the effectiveness of iHAS across different recommendation models<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>EFFICIENCY ANALYSIS<|>IHAS<|>The efficiency analysis compares the inference time of iHAS with other baseline models<|>7)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
