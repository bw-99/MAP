CONCLUSION<h2>text</h2>In this paper, for a random key graph, we derive the asymptotically exact probabilities for two properties with an arbitrary k: (i) the graph is k-connected; and (ii) each node has at least k neighboring nodes. Numerical experiments are in accordance with our analytical results.<h2>publication_ref</h2>[]<h2>figure_ref</h2>[]<h2>table_ref</h2>[]<h2>heading</h2>APPENDIX<h2>text</h2><h2>publication_ref</h2>[]<h2>figure_ref</h2>[]<h2>table_ref</h2>[]<h2>heading</h2>A.

For a random key graph G(n, X n , Y n ) under X n ≥ 2 and q n = ln n+(k-1) ln ln n+ αn n , the following results hold: (i) If lim n→∞ α n = -∞, there exists graph G(n, X n , Y n ) under X n ≥ 2 and q n = ln n+(k-1) ln ln n+ αn n with lim n→∞ α n = -∞ and α n = -O(ln ln n) ( q n is the edge probability of G(n, X n , Y n )), such that there exists a graph\n(ii) If lim n→∞ α n = ∞, there exists graph G(n, X n , Y n ) under X n ≥ 2 and q n = ln n+(k-1) ln ln n+ αn n with lim n→∞ α n = ∞ and α n = O(ln ln n) ( q n is the edge probability of G(n, X n , Y n )), such that there exists a graph coupling under which  \n2 As used by Rybarczyk [7], [8], a coupling of two random graphs G 1 and G 2 means a probability space on which random graphs G ′ 1 and G ′ 2 are defined such that G ′ 1 and G ′ 2 have the same distributions as G 1 and G 2 , respectively. If G ′ 1 is a spanning subgraph (resp., spanning supergraph) of G ′ 2 , we say that under the coupling, G 1 is a spanning subgraph (resp., spanning supergraph) of G 2 , which yields that for any monotone increasing property I, the probability of G 1 having I is at most (reap., at least) the probability of G 2 having I.<h2>publication_ref</h2>['b6', 'b7']<h2>figure_ref</h2>[]<h2>table_ref</h2>[]<h1>references</h1><h2>ref_id</h2>b0<h2>title</h2>On the complexity of the herding attack and some related attacks on hash functions<h2>journal</h2>Designs, Codes and Cryptography<h2>year</h2>2012<h2>authors</h2>S Blackburn; D Stinson; J Upadhyay<h2>ref_id</h2>b1<h2>title</h2>Connectivity of the uniform random intersection graph<h2>journal</h2>Discrete Mathematics<h2>year</h2>2009-08<h2>authors</h2>S R Blackburn; S Gerke<h2>ref_id</h2>b2<h2>title</h2>On the strength of connectedness of random graphs<h2>journal</h2>Acta Math.
