The searching stage aims to identify the optimal embedding dimensions for each sample across different fields. Subsequent stages of clustering and retraining provide a mechanism for gathering similar samples as clusters and training cluster-customized DLRMs based on the individual optimal dimensions, thereby enhancing recommendation predictions. We conduct extensive experiments on two large-scale datasets to authenticate the efficacy of the proposed framework. The results demonstrate that iHAS could boost the performance of deep recommendations while reducing inference costs. Additionally, iHAS exhibits outstanding transferability to popular DLRMs.<h2>publication_ref</h2>[]<h2>figure_ref</h2>[]<h2>table_ref</h2>[]<h1>references</h1><h2>ref_id</h2>b0<h2>title</h2>Deep learning using rectified linear units (relu)<h2>journal</h2><h2>year</h2>2018<h2>authors</h2>Abien Fred; Agarap <h2>ref_id</h2>b1<h2>title</h2>Estimating or propagating gradients through stochastic neurons for conditional computation<h2>journal</h2><h2>year</h2>2013<h2>authors</h2>Yoshua Bengio; Nicholas Léonard; Aaron Courville<h2>ref_id</h2>b2<h2>title</h2>Simple and scalable response prediction for display advertising<h2>journal</h2>ACM Transactions on Intelligent Systems and Technology (TIST)<h2>year</h2>2014<h2>authors</h2>Olivier Chapelle; Eren Manavoglu; Romer Rosales<h2>ref_id</h2>b3<h2>title</h2>Wide & deep learning for recommender systems<h2>journal</h2><h2>year</h2>2016<h2>authors</h2>Heng-Tze Cheng; Levent Koc; Jeremiah Harmsen; Tal Shaked; Tushar Chandra; Hrishi Aradhye; Glen Anderson; Greg Corrado; Wei Chai; Mustafa Ispir<h2>ref_id</h2>b4<h2>title</h2>Towards Automatic Discovering of Deep Hybrid Network Architecture for Sequential Recommendation<h2>journal</h2><h2>year</h2>2022<h2>authors</h2>Mingyue Cheng; Zhiding Liu; Qi Liu; Shenyang Ge; Enhong Chen<h2>ref_id</h2>b5<h2>title</h2>Deep neural networks for youtube recommendations<h2>journal</h2><h2>year</h2>2016<h2>authors</h2>Paul Covington; Jay Adams; Emre Sargin<h2>ref_id</h2>b6<h2>title</h2>Statistical theory of extreme values and some practical applications: a series of lectures<h2>journal</h2>US Government Printing Office<h2>year</h2>1954<h2>authors</h2>Emil Julius; Gumbel <h2>ref_id</h2>b7<h2>title</h2>DeepFM: a factorization-machine based neural network for CTR prediction<h2>journal</h2><h2>year</h2>2017<h2>authors</h2>Huifeng Guo; Ruiming Tang; Yunming Ye; Zhenguo Li; Xiuqiang He<h2>ref_id</h2>b8<h2>title</h2>Social media recommendation based on people and tags<h2>journal</h2><h2>year</h2>2010<h2>authors</h2>Ido Guy; Naama Zwerdling; Inbal Ronen; David Carmel; Erel Uziel<h2>ref_id</h2>b9<h2>title</h2>Neural factorization machines for sparse predictive analytics<h2>journal</h2><h2>year</h2>2017<h2>authors</h2>Xiangnan He; Tat-Seng Chua<h2>ref_id</h2>b10<h2>title</h2>Categorical Reparameterization with Gumbel-Softmax<h2>journal</h2><h2>year</h2><h2>authors</h2>Eric Jang; Shixiang Gu; Ben Poole<h2>ref_id</h2>b11<h2>title</h2>Have We Learned to Explain?: How Interpretability Methods Can Learn to Encode Predictions in their Interpretations<h2>journal</h2>PMLR<h2>year</h2>2021<h2>authors</h2>Neil Jethani; Mukund Sudarshan; Yindalon Aphinyanaphongs; Rajesh Ranganath<h2>ref_id</h2>b12<h2>title</h2>Adam: A method for stochastic optimization<h2>journal</h2><h2>year</h2>2014<h2>authors</h2>P Diederik; Jimmy Kingma;  Ba<h2>ref_id</h2>b13<h2>title</h2>xdeepfm: Combining explicit and implicit feature interactions for recommender systems<h2>journal</h2><h2>year</h2>2018<h2>authors</h2>Jianxun Lian; Xiaohuan Zhou; Fuzheng Zhang; Zhongxia Chen; Xing\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}}
