If G ′ 1 is a spanning subgraph (resp., spanning supergraph) of G ′ 2 , we say that under the coupling, G 1 is a spanning subgraph (resp., spanning supergraph) of G 2 , which yields that for any monotone increasing property I, the probability of G 1 having I is at most (reap., at least) the probability of G 2 having I. </p><h2>publication_ref</h2> <p>['b6', 'b7'] </p><h2>figure_ref</h2> <p>[] </p><h2>table_ref</h2> <p>[] </p><h1>references</h1><h2>ref_id</h2> <p>b0 </p><h2>title</h2> <p>On the complexity of the herding attack and some related attacks on hash functions </p><h2>journal</h2> <p>Designs, Codes and Cryptography </p><h2>year</h2> <p>2012 </p><h2>authors</h2> <p>S Blackburn; D Stinson; J Upadhyay </p><h2>ref_id</h2> <p>b1 </p><h2>title</h2> <p>Connectivity of the uniform random intersection graph </p><h2>journal</h2> <p>Discrete Mathematics </p><h2>year</h2> <p>2009-08 </p><h2>authors</h2> <p>S R Blackburn; S Gerke </p><h2>ref_id</h2> <p>b2 </p><h2>title</h2> <p>On the strength of connectedness of random graphs </p><h2>journal</h2> <p>Acta Math.
