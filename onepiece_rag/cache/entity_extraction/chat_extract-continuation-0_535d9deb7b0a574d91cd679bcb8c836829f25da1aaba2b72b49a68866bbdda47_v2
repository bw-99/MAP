All of the user-item interactions are thoroughly collected in the dataset file, it also contains review comments, which can be perfectly employed in the scenario of our work. Furthermore, we take images and titles from the metadata file as input features of items. In our task scenario, we sample the interactions user by user, and split the datasets 75% for train, 5% for validation, and 20% for testing. By adopting the approach that samples the interactions user by user, we can ensure that all users receive training during the training process, eliminating the possibility of a user being included in the testing set without being part of the training set. The detailed data statistics are summarized in Table 1. Cumulative Gain (NDCG). We set all the metric rankings at the top-{5, 10} to evaluate and prove efficiency. For those items that have no interaction with the user are treated as negative ones, and the interacted items in the test set which is not seen in the train set are treated as positive ones. In this paper, we abbreviate R for Recall, and N for NDCG, respectively.<h2>publication_ref</h2>[]<h2>figure_ref</h2>[]<h2>table_ref</h2>['tab_0']<h2>heading</h2>Dataset<h2>text</h2><h2>publication_ref</h2>[]<h2>figure_ref</h2>[]<h2>table_ref</h2>[]<h2>heading</h2>4.2.2<h2>text</h2>Baseline Methods. We consider five baseline models for comparisons in the experiments, including (1) BPRMF [29] as a pure CF model, (2) LightGCN [12] as the state-of-the-art GCNbased recommendation model, (3) RGCL [34] as the state-of-the-art review-based rating prediction model, (4) TPR [6] incorporating item titles and descriptions at the token-level with a knowledge graph learning, and (5) AGTM [14] leveraging LightGCN and models both item textual contents at the sentence level and high-order connectivity in the user-item graph for the top-N recommendation.\nFor TPR 2 and RGCL 3 , we directly use their official codes which are publicly accessible on GitHub. Here, we would like to explain the reasons why we tend not to showcase the review-based baselines for model comparison. If we directly transform the rating prediction tasks, such as DeepCoNN [50] and NARRE [2], into top-N recommendation tasks, it empirically leads to terrible performance. Even though we perform the top-N task on the state-of-the-art review-based rating prediction model, i.e., RGCL [34], the Recall and NDCG metric are less than 0.015, which are still incredibly low. Therefore, we neglect the review-based recommendation part except for RGCL.<h2>publication_ref</h2>['b28', 'b11', 'b33', 'b5', 'b13', 'b49', 'b1', 'b33']<h2>figure_ref</h2>[]<h2>table_ref</h2>[]<h2>heading</h2>Implementation Details.<h2>text</h2>The printf is mainly implemented in PyTorch.
