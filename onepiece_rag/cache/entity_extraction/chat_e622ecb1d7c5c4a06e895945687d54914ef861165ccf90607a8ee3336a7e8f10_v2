There is a growing demand for machine learning models that can describe and explain the price change of an individual or a portfolio of stocks in the market. Factor investing is one of the most widely used strategies in quantitative investment. In a factor investing paradigm [Tsi18, FF92, FF04], a selective collection of financial variables called factors (e.g., a company's fundamental data and its growth measures) are used as input predictors and stock returns are set as target outcomes to build predictive models. With these models, traders forecast future stock returns regularly in order to construct time-sensitive portfolios composed of a small set of high-return securities. The returns of these securities are expected to beat the average market return, which is known as the excess return. Recent global surveys show that the factor investing paradigm is employed by 90% of institutional investors to manage at least part of their portfolio [MAHG16]. The percentage of assets traded with factor investing is over 30% in size and still fast-growing.\nDespite the prevalence of factor investing, selecting an effective set of factors for market investment is a difficult task. There can be hundreds of candidate factors or more available for predictive mod-els. Currently, most quantitative traders manually select factors by comparing their corresponding portfolio returns in a standard backtesting. Such a trial-and-error approach is indirect, less intuitive, and often requires an exhaustive search in the vast combinatorial factor space. To compute returns from a set of factors, a predictive model and stock portfolio need to be constructed, whose interactions with the selected factors are not fully understood and utilized in the current approach. Traders must also speculate an initial factor selection for evaluation. On the other hand, feature selection methods in machine learning research [GE03] have been applied to this domain, but not as an end-to-end approach like many other fields. Algorithm-selected factors are mostly used as a reference or starting point of the manual selection process, as these factors (especially in black-box models) are not trusted by traders until they can be explained and evaluated. There are currently few tools that can combine human intelligence (e.g., prior knowledge of a factor's utility) and computational power (e.g., assessing stability and sensitivity of a factor) for factor selection in stock markets. This work is committed to three essential requirements of interactive factor investing. First, traders need an intuitive and comprehensive way to assess the performance of numerous factors with respect to excess returns. Second, high-performance factors need to be selected and refined together with high-return stocks in the construction of an investment portfolio. Third, portfolios need to be evaluated and compared in the industry-standard backtesting for their returns in both past and future outlook. To meet these requirements, we present iQUANT (interactive Quantitative investment Using spArse regressioN facTors), a visual analytics system that seamlessly integrates human and algorithmic factor selection for effective factor investing in stock markets. iQUANT enjoys the best of both worlds from human intelligence by a heuristic search in the combinatorial factor space and from computational power by summarizing and presenting key performance metrics of factors and stocks in close interactions. The contributions of this work can be summarized as follows.\n• We explore the use of sparse regression models as the initial feature selection method for factor investing. Sparse regression models are preferred as they optimize the procedure between factor selection and stock prediction in the same process. Performance metrics of factors are computed, including not only their feature weights, but also the factor contribution that describes its importance to the prediction. • We introduce elaborate visualization designs that comprehensively illustrate the performance of factors in the regression model to predict the prices of candidate stocks. Our designs are based on expert studies about empirical characteristics of valuable factors, including stability and sensitivity. • On top of the visualization interface, we propose an interaction framework for factor investing that allows traders to jointly select high-performance factors and high-return stocks in an integrated model-building and portfolio-construction process. By our framework, traders can iteratively refine the factor selection and stock portfolio based on visual evidence shown in the interface. The industry-standard backtesting is also supported. • We evaluate iQUANT in a formal user study comparing with baseline alternatives. Case studies with domain experts on targeted user tasks are conducted using a real stock market dataset.\nExpert feedback about iQUANT is also reported and discussed.<h2>publication_ref</h2>[]<h2>figure_ref</h2>[]<h2>table_ref</h2>[]<h2>heading</h2>Related Work<h2>text</h2><h2>publication_ref</h2>[]<h2>figure_ref</h2>[]<h2>table_ref</h2>[]<h2>heading</h2>Financial Data Visualization<h2>text</h2>Financial data, such as stock/fund prices and economic indicators, has been widely used by traders and investors to guide their investment decisions. Currently, few studies have been done in integrating visualization into the factor investing process. Some existing studies [CHL * 03,RSE09,SLFE11] apply visualizations to help manage investment portfolios. FundExplorer [CHL * 03] introduces a distorted treemap to visualize both the composition of a fund's portfolio and the remaining stocks. Their design facilitates the convenient retrieval of complementary funds to achieve portfolio diversification.
