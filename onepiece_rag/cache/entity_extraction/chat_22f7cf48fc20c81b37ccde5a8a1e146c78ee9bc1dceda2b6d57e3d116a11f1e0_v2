Another threat to external validity relates to the diversity of the fix patterns used in this study. iFixR currently may not implement a reasonable number of relevant fix patterns. We minimize this threat by surveying the literature and considering patterns from several pattern-based APR. Threats to internal validity: Our implementation of fine-grained IRFL carries some threats: during the search of buggy statements, we considered top-50 suspicious buggy files from the file-level IRFL tool, to limit the search space. Different threshold values may lead to different results. We also considered only 5 statement types as more bug-prone. This second threat is minimized by the empirical evidence provided by Liu et al. [47].\nAdditionally, another internal threat is in our patch generation steps: iFixR only searches for donor code from the local code files, which contain the buggy statement. The adequate fix ingredient may however be located elsewhere. Threats to construct validity: In this study, we assumed that patch construction and test case creation are two separated tasks for developers. This may not be the case in practice. The threat is however mitigated given that, in any case, we have shown that the test cases are often unavailable when the bug is reported.<h2>publication_ref</h2>['b82', 'b0', 'b70', 'b99', 'b16', 'b46']<h2>figure_ref</h2>['fig_8', 'fig_9']<h2>table_ref</h2>['tab_16']<h2>heading</h2>RELATED WORK<h2>text</h2>Fault Localization. As stated in a recent study [48], fault localization is a critical task affecting the effectiveness of automated program repair. Several techniques have been proposed [67,80,88] and they use different information such as spectrum [4], text [85], slice [58], and statistics [42]. The first two types of techniques are widely studies in the community. SBFL techniques [3,20] are widely adopted in APR pipelines since they identify bug positions at a fine-grained level (i.e., statements). However, they have limitations on localizing buggy locations since it highly relies on the test suite [48]. Information retrieval based fault localization (IRFL) [41] leverages textual information in a bug report. It is mainly used to help developers narrow down suspected buggy files in the absence of relevant test cases. For the purpose of our study, we have proposed an algorithm for further localizing the faulty code entities at the statement level. Patch Generation. Patch generation is another key process of APR pipeline, which is, in other words, a task searching for another shape of a program (i.e., a patch) in the space of all possible programs [37,54]. To improve repair performance, many APR systems have been explored to address the search space problem by using different information and approaches: stochastic mutation [38,83], synthesis [53,92,93], pattern [14,18,19,26,32,36,49,51,52,73], contract [12,82], symbolic execution [65], learning [8,16,55,70,77,86], and donor code searching [25,62]. In this paper, patch generation is implemented with fix patterns presented in the literature since it may make the generated patches more robust [74]. Patch Validation. The ultimate goal of APR systems is to automatically generate a correct patch that can actually resolve the program defects rather than satisfying minimal functional constraints. At the beginning, patch correctness is evaluated by passing all test cases [26,36,83]. However, these patches could be overfitting [34,69] and even worse than the bug [76]. Since then, APR systems are evaluated with the precision of generating correct patches [19,49,84,92]. Recently, researchers explore automated frameworks that can identify patch correctness for APR systems automatically [35,91]. In this paper, our approach validates generated patches with regression test suites since fail-inducing test cases are readily available for most of bugs as described in Section 2.<h2>publication_ref</h2>['b47', 'b66', 'b79', 'b87', 'b3', 'b84', 'b57', 'b41', 'b2', 'b19', 'b47', 'b40', 'b36', 'b53', 'b37', 'b82', 'b52', 'b91', 'b92', 'b13', 'b17', 'b18', 'b25', 'b31', 'b35', 'b48', 'b50', 'b51', 'b72', 'b11', 'b81', 'b64', 'b7', 'b15', 'b54', 'b69', 'b76', 'b85', 'b24', 'b61', 'b73', 'b25', 'b35', 'b82', 'b33', 'b68', 'b75', 'b18', 'b48', 'b83', 'b91', 'b34', 'b90']<h2>figure_ref</h2>[]<h2>table_ref</h2>[]<h2>heading</h2>CONCLUSION<h2>text</h2>In this study, we have investigated the feasibility of automating patch generation from bug reports.
