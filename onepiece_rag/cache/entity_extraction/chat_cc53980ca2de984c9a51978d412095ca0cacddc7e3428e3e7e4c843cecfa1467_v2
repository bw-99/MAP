For example, Figure 3b gives the ratio of number of songs in a concert is janya or melakartha ragam, and Figure 3d gives the ratio of types of ragams in concerts(audava,sampoorna,vakra, and other ragams). Due to space constraints, we neglected the distribution of rarely occurring type of ragam(shadava ragam) from this figure. Our data also consists of metadata of all 280 ragams. We use concert structure(organization of ragams in each concert) to build the raaga network and we populate metadata as node features in the network. We further use this network of ragam patterns in experiments for the proposed model to recommend ragams. TABLE I: Features of ragams in the RagaNetwork. Each node in the raga network depicts a ragam and thus each node holds the below features. Although position of ragams in a concert is important, it can be identified by traversing before and after nodes matching the concert id. <h2>publication_ref</h2>[]<h2>figure_ref</h2>['fig_2', 'fig_2', 'fig_2', 'fig_2', 'fig_2', 'fig_2']<h2>table_ref</h2>[]<h2>heading</h2>B. Baseline Models<h2>text</h2>Below are some of the popular baseline models that we used to compare our methods\n• Item-kNN [24]: Item-kNN is similar to extracting the nearby recommendations. In this method, we find cooccurring items normalized by popularity of all items in the list.\n• FPMC [25]: Factorized Personalized Markov Chain is one of the popular models to recommend sequential item in a list. FPMC models the user preference on a list and the preference transitions to recommend next set of items.\n• SWIWO [17]: Session-based Wide In Wide Out(SWIWO) is a deep learning based recommender model that uses a both user and item based feature set to predict the next item. To adapt to our problem, we eliminate the user feature section and add a softmax layer to predict the score of items for a given sequence.\nWe compare proposed model against existing methods in producing recommendations for south Indian classical music concerts. To make fair comparison, we use offline evaluation methods for all algorithms, similar to comparisons made in existing works. In particular, we use following evaluation methods:\n• Precision@k: We evaluate on number of recommendations (k) to make (i.e.) We evaluate from k = 1 (Recommending just one item) to k = 15 (Recommending 15 items). • Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain(nDCG): It is a measure to evaluate the rank of relevant recommendations, calculated using the formula given in Equation 6nDCG\n= n i=1 1 log2(i) DCG id(6)\n, where n is the number of items in the list to predicted correctly, i is the position of the relevant item in the recommendation, DCG id is an ideal score for the given test sample. Similar to Precision@k, we give results of nDCG@k, where k is the number of items to recommend.  <h2>publication_ref</h2>['b23', 'b24', 'b16']<h2>figure_ref</h2>[]<h2>table_ref</h2>[]<h2>heading</h2>C. Results<h2>text</h2>For all our experiments we split the available concerts into training (80%) and test (20%) data, where the training data is used as historical data and the test data is considered as new concerts. Since the goal is to recommend ragams for incomplete concert list and number of ragams in a concert is inconsistent, we conduct our experiments with an assumption Fig. 5: nDCG@k evaluation for different models that the user starts with one ragam (first ragam from the test concert), the system gives prediction and evaluate obtain results, then it considers first two ragams, and the cycle continues. For training the model, we split each concert into multiple sequences in such a way that all instances have at least one user input ragam and one prediction. All results that we report here is an average score of all measures. Figure 4 gives precision@k scores and the Figure 5 gives nDCG@k scores for all baseline and proposed models, where k is the required number of recommendations. We use the average number of songs in overall concerts as the upper bound(15 recommendations), while maintaining a simple lower bound(1 recommendation). From these plots, we can evidence that the baseline models give poor performance in giving recommendations for south Indian classical music concerts. Importantly, we can study from Figure 5 that primarily the proposed ragamAI model give more relevant predictions with even shorter list of recommendations. It is also evident from these plots that structural organization of ragams in Indian classical music concerts play a vital role in building recommendations.\nTable II gives the ablation study with multiple combinations in the proposed model. It is evident from these results that each model gives only average performance compared to the proposed model when used alone for the recommendation task. When both features combined as given in the proposed model, we get improved performance.<h2>publication_ref</h2>[]<h2>figure_ref</h2>['fig_3']<h2>table_ref</h2>['tab_1']<h2>heading</h2>VI.
