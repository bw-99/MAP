The CTR buffer is a CMA that stores the CTR for each candidate item and the item index which are used for selecting the final top-k items. (2e) The CTR buffer then performs a topk operation using the threshold match mode of the CMA by searching a vector of all 1's (the maximum allowable CMA input).<h2>publication_ref</h2>[]<h2>figure_ref</h2>['fig_0', 'fig_2', 'fig_2', 'fig_2', 'fig_2', 'fig_2']<h2>table_ref</h2>[]<h2>heading</h2>IV. EVALUATION<h2>text</h2>We evaluated the RecSys implementations with two RecSys instances: (1) YoutubeDNN model [2] on the MovieLens 1M dataset, which includes both the filtering and ranking stage; (2) DLRM model [1] targeting at the ranking stage on the Criteo Kaggle dataset. The configurations of the two RecSys shown in Table I were implemented on Nvidia RTX 1080 GPU. We used the tools Nvidia-smi and lineprofiler to obtain energy and latency, respectively. We only compared with the GPU evaluation as other accelerators use older RecSys models and datasets.\nWe dimension B, M and C based on the largest dataset used in our evaluation (i.e., the Criteo Kaggle) with the configuration shown in Table . I. Each ET have different number of entries. In this configuration, the maximum size of the ETs in the Criteo Kaggle is 30,000 entries. Since each CMA has 256 rows, 118 CMAs are required to store the embedding table. The number of arrays is rounded up to the nearest power-oftwo value, i.e., 128. We choose C=32, which corresponds to 4 mats (M =4) working in parallel inside each bank, to have a balance between storing small and large ETs. The outputs from the 4 mats are accumulated at the bank level. Finally, the Criteo Kaggle dataset has 26 sparse features for ranking. Hence, we dimension iMARS with 32 banks (B=32) to accomodate all these features. The other features are also mapped accordingly,  with some mats and CMAs deactivated in a bank according to the size of the ET. We use 26 activated banks, 104 activated mats and 2860 activated CMAs for the Criteo Kaggle dataset.\nFor the MovieLens dataset (also used in our evaluation), due to the much smaller number of rows per ET, we are still able to use the same architecture while keeping idle arrays deactivated. The MovieLens dataset uses 5 UIET for the filtering stage and 6 UIET for the ranking stage (Table I), 5 of which are shared between the filtering and ranking stages. ETs have a maximum of 6040 entries and a minimum of 3 entries. We use 7 active banks, 8 active mat and 54 active CMA in the MovieLens dataset.<h2>publication_ref</h2>['b1', 'b0']<h2>figure_ref</h2>[]<h2>table_ref</h2>['tab_0', 'tab_0']<h2>heading</h2>A. Array-level Evaluation<h2>text</h2>We have designed the complete circuit of a 256×256 FeFET-based CMA, and simulated it in HSPICE by employing a Preisach based model for FeFETs [19] along with the CMOS Predictive Technology Model (PTM) from [20] with a 45nm technology node. In our evaluation, besides the memory cells inside each CMA, we also consider all the peripherals depicted in Fig. 3(c). The adder trees and communication network are implemented in Verilog and synthesized with Cadence Encounter RTL Compiler v14.10, with the NanGate 45nm open-cell library [21]. The crossbars are evaluated by the Neurosim tool [22] using a 45nm FeFET model. Table II summarizes the array-level figures-of-merit (FoM) for the different types of accesses supported by the CMA. Table II also includes the FoM for a 256×128 crossbar. These values are used for higher-level evaluations.<h2>publication_ref</h2>['b18', 'b19', 'b20', 'b21']<h2>figure_ref</h2>['fig_2']<h2>table_ref</h2>['tab_1']<h2>heading</h2>B. Accuracy Evaluation<h2>text</h2>We examined the algorithm-level performance (i.e., accuracy) of RecSys when using quantized data representation and when using different distance functions. We implemented a YoutubeDNN filtering model [2] on the MovieLens 1M dataset [11], where a FAISS-based distance search is used. We use the hit rate (HR), the # of hits (i.e., correct predictions) divided by the # of test users, as the accuracy metric.
