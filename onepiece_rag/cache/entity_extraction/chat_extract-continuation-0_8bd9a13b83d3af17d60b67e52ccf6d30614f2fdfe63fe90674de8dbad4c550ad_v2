Results support the first hypothesis that unimodal embeddings may miss relevant items if they don't lie close to the user in the shared embedding space. Mixture of embeddings with no smoothing, yields a 14% relative improvement in R@10 for for HEP-TH, and 16% relative improvement for DBLP. Our second hypothesis (2) posits that data sparsity can lead to sub-optimal mixtures of embeddings, and that nearest-neighbor smoothing can mitigate this. Our experiments support this hypothesis, as we see a 25% relative improvement for HEP-TH in R@10, and 35% for DBLP and when using kNN-Embed. We see similar significant improvements over baselines in R@20 and R@50. For Twitter-Follow, the improvements in recall are dramatic -534% in relative terms going from unimodal embeddings to a mixture of embeddings in R@10. We suspect this significant improvement is because Twitter-Follow simultaneously has a much higher average degree than HEP-TH and DBLP and the number of unique nodes is much larger. It is a more difficult task to embed so many items, from many different interest clusters, in close proximity to a user. As such, we see a massive improvement by explicitly querying from each user's interest clusters. Applying smoothing provides an additional 74% in relative terms, and similar behaviours are observed in R@20 and R@50. </p><h2>publication_ref</h2> <p>['b1'] </p><h2>figure_ref</h2> <p>[] </p><h2>table_ref</h2> <p>['tab_2'] </p><h2>heading</h2> <p>Diversity: </p><h2>text</h2> <p>We apply Equation 8 to retrieved candidates and measure the spread of retrieved candidates' embedding vectors. As seen in Table 2, the candidates from unimodal retrieval are less diverse than candidates retrieved via multiple queries from mixture representations. This verifies our first research hypothesis that unimodal embeddings may retrieve many items that are clustered closely together as a by-product of ANN retrieval (i.e., diversity and recall is low). However, multiple queries from mixtures of embeddings broadens the search spatially; retrieved items are from different clusters, which are more spread out from each other. kNN-Embed (i.e., smooth mixture retrieval) results in slightly less diverse candidates than unsmoothed mixture retrieval. We posit that this is due to the high-variance of the maximum likelihood estimator of the p mle (c|u j ) multinomial (Equation 3). While this high-variance may yield more diverse candidates, this yields less relevant candidates as seen in Table 1 where kNN-Embed consistently yields better recall than unsmoothed mixture retrieval. While high diversity is necessary for high recall, it is insufficient on its own.  </p><h2>publication_ref</h2> <p>[] </p><h2>figure_ref</h2> <p>[] </p><h2>table_ref</h2> <p>['tab_4', 'tab_2'] </p><h2>heading</h2> <p>Goodness of Fit: </p><h2>text</h2> <p>We evaluate how well unimodal, mixture, and smoothed mixture embeddings model a user's interests. The main idea is that the better fit a user representation is, the closer it will be to the distribution of held out relevant items for that user. As seen in Table 3, the results validate the idea that unimodal user embeddings do not model user interests as well as mixtures over multiple embeddings. Multiple embeddings yield a significant EMD improvement over a single embedding vector when evaluated on held-out items. Smoothing further decreases the EMD which we posit is due to the smoothed embedding mixtures being lower-variance estimates as they leverage engagement data from similar users in constructing the representations. These results suggest that the higher recall of smoothed mixtures is due to better user preferences modeling.  </p><h2>publication_ref</h2> <p>[] </p><h2>figure_ref</h2> <p>[] </p><h2>table_ref</h2> <p>['tab_5'] </p><h2>heading</h2> <p>Hyper-parameter Sensitivity Analysis: </p><h2>text</h2> <p>We focus on recall as the sine qua non of candidate retrieval problems and analyze hyper-parameters on HEP-TH. In Figure 3a, we vary the smoothing parameter λ (same parameter for both the mixture probabilities and the cluster centroids) and see heavy smoothing improves performance significantly. This likely stems from the sparsity of HEP-TH where most papers have only a few citations. In Figure 3b, we vary the number of embeddings (i.e., the mixture size) and notice improved performance saturating at six mixture components. Out of all the hyperparameters, this seems to be the critical one in achieving high recall. In practice, latency constraints can be considered when selecting the number of embeddings per user, explicitly making the trade-off between diversity and latency.    </p><h2>publication_ref</h2> <p>[] </p><h2>figure_ref</h2> <p>['fig_3', 'fig_3'] </p><h\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>HEP-TH<|>CONCEPT<|>HEP-TH is a citation prediction task dataset used for evaluating recall in embedding models.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DBLP<|>CONCEPT<|>DBLP is a digital library for computer science and a dataset used for citation prediction tasks.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>KNN-EMBED<|>CONCEPT<|>KNN-Embed is a method that applies nearest-neighbor smoothing to improve the performance of embedding models in retrieval tasks.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CANDIDATE RETRIEVAL<|>EVENT<|>Candidate retrieval is the process of selecting relevant items based on user preferences and embeddings.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MIXTURE OF EMBEDDINGS<|>CONCEPT<|>A mixture of embeddings refers to combining multiple embedding representations to improve recall and diversity in retrieval tasks.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>USER INTERESTS<|>CONCEPT<|>User interests are the preferences and behaviors of users that can be modeled using embeddings for better retrieval performance.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>HEP-TH<|>DBLP<|>HEP-TH and DBLP are both datasets used in citation prediction tasks, indicating a relationship in their application<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>KNN-EMBED<|>MIXTURE OF EMBEDDINGS<|>KNN-Embed is a specific method that utilizes a mixture of embeddings to enhance retrieval performance<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CANDIDATE RETRIEVAL<|>USER INTERESTS<|>Candidate retrieval aims to match items with user interests, highlighting their interdependence<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MIXTURE OF EMBEDDINGS<|>USER INTERESTS<|>Using a mixture of embeddings helps in better modeling user interests for retrieval tasks<|>8)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
