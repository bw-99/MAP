Specifically, iMARS uses in-memory addition to sum, in a single memory array, embeddings comprised of 32 dimensions with int-8 quantization. To accumulate (sum up) the outputs of the CMAs for each mat, iMARS sums up C 256-bit (i.e., 32×8)-bit numbers leveraging a near-memory, 256-bit intramat adder tree placed in each mat. Different mats can perform intra-mat additions in parallel. Once the intra-mat additions are completed, their results are accumulated across the K mats to produce a single 256-bit result (one output per memory bank). iMARS supports the addition of four 256-bit inputs inside a near-memory \"Intra-bank Adder Tree\" in one shot (bottom right of Fig. 3(b)). In other words, we design an \"Intra-bank Adder Tree\" with a fan-in of 4, a design choice made as a compromise between area footprint of the iMARS banks and performance of the intra-bank addition. In cases where more inputs need to be accumulated (i.e., when K > 4), multiple rounds of addition are needed using the same \"Intra-bank Adder Tree\".\nThe aforementioned design parameters B, M and C largely impact the area, capacity and the performance of iMARS. First, area footprint increases proportionally to B, M and C. Larger B, M and C increase the capacity of iMARS for storing embeddings. High capacity enables iMARS to accomodate big workloads. However, a large C implies a large fan-in for the \"Intra-mat Adder Tree\" inside each mat, which leads to parasitic effects that increases the delay for aggregating the outputs of multiple CMAs. A large K, in turn, implies that more mats are connected to (and sharing) the same communication bus, which increases the overall latency of the RecSys (to be discussed in Sec. III-A3).\n2) DNN Stack: The DNN stack requires matrix-vector multiplications which can be implemented using crossbar arrays in iMARS (Fig. 3(a)). Two dedicated crossbar banks are employed to execute the ranking and the filtering DNN stack composed of fully connected layers. Each crossbar bank contains multiple crossbar arrays (Fig. 3(d)) in order to accomodate the respective DNN model. These crossbar banks both hold the DNN Stack to obtain dense features and the DNN stack that returns a user embedding during the filtering stage or a user item-score for the ranking stage. Crossbar arrays can leverage the FeFET technology [18].\n3) Communication inside iMARS: Data among the different hardware components of iMARS need to be communicated. To ensure such communication does not incur too much overhead, we carefully design communication channels inside iMARS. There are two types of communication in iMARS: (1) communication among the different functional blocks and (2) communication between the mats in each CMA bank. While (1) leverages the RecSys communication (RSC) bus, (2) occurs through the intra-bank communication (IBC) network. The RSC bus and the IBC network are depicted in Fig. 3(a) and (b), respectively.\nThe RSC bus enables the exchange of inputs/outputs through the different hardware blocks in iMARS. While data traffic between the different hardware blocks is essential to the system's overall functionality, the data traffic through the RSC bus is not as intense as the traffic inside the memory banks that store the ETs. Data communication on the IBC network and the RSC bus is serialized to minimize the wiring overhead (thus, reducing the area of iMARS). iMARS is designed for a RSC bus with 256-bit capacity. The IBC, on the other hand, supports the transmission of 128 bytes of data (i.e., four 256bit inputs) to be added up inside the intra-bank adder tree (bottom right of Fig. 3(b)) in one shot. Data communication on the IBC network is serialized when K >4 (the fan-in of the \"Intra-bank Adder Tree\"). The IBC network capacity and the number of \"Intra-bank Adder Tree\" fan-ins are design choices that must take into consideration the impact on area footprint, delay and energy. For instance, extremely wide buses may be impractical as they require too much area to be implemented. On the other hand, a narrow IBC would require many data fetches through the bus across K mats. The overhead of communication with the RSC bus/IBC network is accounted for in the results reported in Sec. IV.\nData traffic inside the RSC and the IBC is orchestrated by a controller circuit (indicated by the box labeled CTRL in Fig. 3(a)). The controller circuit consists of a clock generator and two counters that keep track of (i) the activated bank, and (ii) the mats inside the bank that are sending outputs for accumulation with the \"Intra-bank Adder Tree\" circuit. Data packets always travel through the IBC in a predetermined order, as defined by the counters (i.e., in Bank B, from Mat-1, Mat-2, ..., Mat-M in groups of four outputs, i.e., 128 bytes). The pre-defined communication pattern reduces conflicting accesses and eliminates the need for routers.<h2>publication_ref</h2>['b8', 'b8', 'b8', 'b7', 'b17']<h2>figure_ref</h2>['fig_2', 'fig_2', 'fig_2', 'fig_2', 'fig_2', 'fig_2', 'fig_2', 'fig_2', 'fig\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}}
