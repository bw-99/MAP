Such a factor b has been recently named as a capacity augmentation factor [36]. Note that the capacity augmentation bound was defined without taking this simple condition\nC k + τ i ∈hp(τ k ) Ci M D k ≤ 1\nb in [36], as they focus on implicit-deadline systems. For constrained-deadline systems, adding such a new constraint is a natural extension.\nAn algorithm A is with speed-up factor b: If there exists a feasible schedule for the task system, it is schedulable by algorithm A by speeding up (each processor) to b times as fast as in the original platform (speed). A sufficient schedulability test for scheduling algorithm A is with speed-up factor b: If the task system cannot pass the sufficient schedulability test, the task set is not schedulable by any scheduling algorithm if (each processor) is slowed down to 1 b times of the original platform speed. Note that if the capacity augmentation factor is b, the speed-up factor is also upper-bounded by b.<h2>publication_ref</h2>['b42', 'b35', 'b25', 'b3', 'b9', 'b35', 'b35']<h2>figure_ref</h2>[]<h2>table_ref</h2>[]<h2>heading</h2>Analysis Flow<h2>text</h2>The framework focuses on testing the schedulability and the response time for a task τ k , under the assumption that the required properties (i.e., worst-case response time or the schedulability) of the higher-priority tasks are already verified and provided. We will implicitly assume that all the higherpriority tasks are already verified and the required properties are already obtained. Therefore, this framework has to be applied for each of the given tasks. To ensure whether a task system is schedulable by the given scheduling policy, the test has to be applied for all the tasks. Of course, the results can be extended to test the schedulability of a task system in linear time complexity or to allow on-line admission control in constant time complexity if the schedulability condition (or with some more pessimistic simplifications) is monotonic. Such extensions are presented only for trivial cases.\nWe will only present the schedulability test of a certain task τ k , that is analyzed, under the above assumption. For notational brevity, in the framework presentation, we will implicitly assume that there are k-1 tasks, say τ 1 , τ 2 , . . . , τ k-1 with higher-priority than task τ k . We will use hp(τ k ) to denote the set of these k-1 higher-priority tasks, when their orderings do not matter. Moreover, we only consider the cases when k ≥ 2, since k = 1 is pretty trivial.<h2>publication_ref</h2>[]<h2>figure_ref</h2>[]<h2>table_ref</h2>[]<h2>heading</h2>k 2 Q<h2>text</h2>This section presents the basic properties of the k 2 Q framework for testing the schedulability of task τ k in a given set of real-time tasks (depending on the specific models given in each application). Before presenting the framework, we first give a simple example to explain the underlying concepts by using an implicit-deadline sporadic task system τ , in which D i = T i for every τ i ∈ τ . The exact schedulability test to verify whether task τ k can meet its deadline under fixedpriority scheduling on uniprocessor systems is to check\n∃t with 0 < t ≤ T k and C k + τi∈hp(τ k ) t T i C i ≤ t,(1)\nwhere hp(τ k ) is the set of tasks with higher priority than τ k . Instead of testing all the time points t in the range of 0 and T k , for a sufficient schedulability test, we can greedily only consider to test the time points\n( T k Ti -1)T i for τ i ∈ hp(τ k ) and t = T k . If C k + τi∈hp(τ k )\nt Ti C i ≤ t holds in one of those k tested time points, then we can conclude that τ k can be feasibly scheduled under this scheduling policy.\nTo implement to above testing concept, we need two definitions: 1) Definition 1 defines the last release time ordering so that we can formulate the problem with linear algebra, 2) Definition 2 defines an abstracted schedulability test that can be used to model general schedulability tests regardless of the task and platform model. Definition 1 (Last Release Time Ordering). Let π be the last release time ordering assignment as a bijective function π : hp(τ k ) → {1, 2, . . . , k -1} to define the last release time ordering of task τ j ∈ hp(τ k ) in the window of interest. Last release time orderings are numbered from 1 to k -1, i.e., |hp(τ k )|, where 1 is the earliest and k -1 the latest.\nThe last release time ordering is a very important property in the whole framework. When testing the schedulability or analyzing the worst-case response time of task τ k , we do not need the priority ordering of the higher-priority tasks in hp(τ k ). But, we need to know how to order the k -1 higherpriority tasks so that we can formulate the test with simple and linear arithmetics based on the total order. For the rest of this paper, the ordering\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}}
