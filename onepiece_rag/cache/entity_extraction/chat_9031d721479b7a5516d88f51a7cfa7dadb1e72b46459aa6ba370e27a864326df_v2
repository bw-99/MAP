A sub-factor-matrix is used as the design matrix (predictors), denoted by X (i) = (x (i-1)D+1 , ‚Ä¢ ‚Ä¢ ‚Ä¢ , x (i-1)D+T ). We fit a sparse regression model:\ny (i) = w (i) X (i) + b (i) + Œµ (i) (1)\nSubject to the objective function:\nMinimize Lasso NLL = NLL + 1 2 Œª [Œ±||w (n) || 1 + (1 -Œ±)||w (n) || 2 2 ]\n(2) where w (i) = (w\n(i) 1 , ‚Ä¢ ‚Ä¢ ‚Ä¢ , w (i) F ) denotes the weight vector of financial factors in the fitted model, b (i) is the bias, Œµ (i) is the error term, ||‚Ä¢|| 1 (|| ‚Ä¢ || 2 ) is L 1 (L 2\n) norm of the vector. D is set to 21 (average number of monthly trading days). The best weight vector is computed by minimizing the negative log likelihood (NLL) of a linear regression term plus L 1 and L 2 penalty terms of the weight vector. The penalty terms shrink the weight of unimportant factors to zero. On each trading cycle, the model is applied to predict daily stock returns.\nNote that Œª and Œ± in Eq. (2) control the degree of model sparsity and weights between L 1 and L 2 terms. In this work, we provide three choices of modeling: Œ± = 1 (without the L 2 term), the famous Lasso model [Tib96] with a fixed Œª ; LassoCV model using 10fold cross-validation to determine Œª of the Lasso model The sparse regression model achieves feature selection (L 1 and L 2 penalty terms) and model optimization (regression term) simultaneously. This is extremely helpful to alleviate the overfitting effect in the factor investing case when the number of predictors (F = 56 in our implementation) is comparable to the number of training samples (T = 200). Though we apply a basic linear regression for stock prediction, the sparse models with L 1 and L 2 penalties can be easily extended to support more sophisticated models such as nonlinear models using customized kernel functions. </p><h2>publication_ref</h2> <p>[] </p><h2>figure_ref</h2> <p>[] </p><h2>table_ref</h2> <p>[] </p><h2>heading</h2> <p>Financial Factors </p><h2>text</h2> <p>For factor computation, we adopt the result of a latest white paper on the target stock market [Tsi18], which recommends six types of 56 factors with each factor characterizes a key aspect of a stock:\n‚Ä¢ Transaction friction: 17 factors delineating overall status of a company (e.g., firm size by its market value, age of a firm) and transaction statistics (e.g., volatility, risks measured by stock returns compared with the market return); ‚Ä¢ Momentum: 5 factors computing daily stock returns in the recent 6/12 months, the change of momentum, and specially defined momentums; ‚Ä¢ Value: 8 factors including the famous book-to-market ratio proposed by Fama and French [FF92], the asset-to-market ratio, and other company performance related ratios; ‚Ä¢ Growth: 11 factors describing the growth of a company's asset, debt, market value, sales, profit, tax, etc; ‚Ä¢ Profitability: 8 factors quantifying return on equity, return on asset, and other factors related to company profits; ‚Ä¢ Liquidity: 7 factors characterizing the liquidity performance of a company, including current ratio, quick ratio, cash flow to debt ratio, etc.\nFor the above factors, the ranges of their values differ significantly from each other. Also, their values can change dramatically along with the stock market. Since all the factor values are normalized initially, the relative importance of each factor can be assessed, which can facilitate the factor analysis. The sparse regression model in iQUANT outputs three measures to delineate the importance of each factor in the prediction. Take the jth factor in the ith trading cycle (e.g., daily, monthly or quarterly) as an example, the three measures are as follows:\n‚Ä¢ Factor weight learned in the model, denoted by w (i) j ;\n‚Ä¢ Factor value changing in a daily basis, denoted by X (i) ; ‚Ä¢ Contribution of factors to the prediction of daily stock returns, denoted by\n‚àë T +iD k=T +(i-1)D+1 w (i) j x k j .\nBy collecting the feedback from traders in our pilot study, we further extracted three metrics that are widely-used in industry to delineate the utilization of each factor. These two metrics are visualized in iQUANT to aid the interactive factor selection and stock portfolio construction process.\n‚Ä¢ Sensitivity: a metric that indicates whether the utilization of a factor can be replaced by other factors. The sensitivity is computed by (Œæ i jŒæ i ) + where Œæ i j denotes the prediction error by removing the jth factor from sparse regression models, Œæ i denotes the prediction error of the original model; ‚Ä¢ Stability: a good factor for the predictive model should have stable contributions in a long period of time before confidently applied. Quantitatively, it is measured by the number of times the factor's contribution to a stock's prediction flips from\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}}
