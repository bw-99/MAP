We will repeatedly exploit this \"locality implies similarity\" property of embeddings in this paper to resolve this diversity issue.\nClustering Items: Since neighboring items are similar in the embedding space, if we apply a distance-based clustering to items, we can arrive at groupings that represent individual user preferences well. As such, we first cluster items using spherical k-means [6] where cluster centroids are placed on a high-dimensional sphere with radius one. Given these item clusters, instead of immediately collapsing the distribution p(i k |u j ) to a few items as ANN search does, we can write the full distribution p(i k |u j ) as a mixture over item clusters:\np(i k |u j ) = c p(c|u j ) • p(i k |u j , c)\nwhere in each cluster, we learn a separate distribution over the items in the cluster p(i k |u j , c). Thus, we are modeling each user's higher level interests p(c|u), and then within each interest c, we can apply an efficient ANN-search strategy as before. In effect, we are interpolating between sampling the full preference distribution p(i k |u j ) and greedily selecting a few items in an ANN. </p><h2>publication_ref</h2> <p>['b5'] </p><h2>figure_ref</h2> <p>[] </p><h2>table_ref</h2> <p>[] </p><h2>heading</h2> <p>Mixture of Embeddings via Cluster Engagements: </p><h2>text</h2> <p>After clustering target entities, we learn p(c|u j ) through its maximum likelihood estimator (MLE):\np mle (c|u j ) = count(u i , c)/ c ′ ∈Mj count(u j , c ′ )(3)\nwhere, count(u j , c) is the number of times u j has a relevant item in cluster c. For computational efficiency, we take M j to be u j 's top m most relevant clusters. We normalize these counts to obtain a proper cluster-relevance distribution.\nNearest Neighbor Smoothing: Unfortunately, we typically have few user-item engagements on a per-user basis; thus, while the MLE is unbiased and asymptotically efficient, it can also be high variance. To this end, we introduce a smoothing technique that once again exploits locality in the ANN search, this time for users. Figure 1 illustrates identifying k nearest-neighbors (K j ) to the query user u j 's, and leveraging the information from the neighbors' cluster engagements to augment the user's cluster relevance. We compute this distribution over item clusters by averaging the MLE probability for each nearest neighbor (item clusters that are not engaged with by a retrieved neighbor have zero probability).\np k N N (c|u j ) = 1 |K j | u ′ ∈Kj p mle (c|u ′ )(4)\nWe apply Jelinik-Mercer smoothing to interpolate between a user's MLE distribution with the aggregated nearest neighbor distribution [12].\np smoothed (c|u j ) = (1 -λ)p mle (c|u j ) + λp k N N (c|u j ),(5)\nwhere λ ∈ [0, 1] represents how much smoothing is applied. It can be manually set or tuned on a downstream extrinsic task. Fig. 1: Example of retrieving two candidates. In an ANN, items 4 and 5 would be deterministically returned for user 1. In our proposed kNN-Embed, even though the distances to cluster 2 are larger, smoothing means that we will sometimes return items from that cluster, yielding more diverse items. Note in this case, we don't even require that user 1 has previously relevant items in cluster 2.\nSampling within Clusters Within each cluster there are many ways to retrieve items on a per user basis. A simple, but appealing, strategy is to represent each user as a normalized centroid of their relevant items in that cluster:\ncentroid(c, u j ) = m∈R(c,uj ) i m ∥ m∈R(c,uj ) i m ∥ ,(6)\nwhere R(c, u j ) is the set of relevant items for user u j in cluster c. However, since we are applying smoothing to the cluster probabilities p(c|u j ), it may be case that u j has zero relevant items in a given cluster. Hence, we smooth the user centroid using neighbor infomation to obtain the final user representation u c j :\nu c j = (1 -λ) centroid(c, u j ) + λ |K j | u ′ ∈Kj p mle (c|u ′ ) centroid(c, u ′ )(7)\nEquation 7 shows the kNN-smoothed user-specific embedding for cluster c. This embedding takes the user-specific cluster representations from Equation 6, and performs a weighted averaging proportionate to each user's contribution to p smoothed (c|u j ). The final vector is once again normalized to unit norm. </p><h2>publication_ref</h2> <p>['b11'] </p><h2>figure_ref</h2> <p>[] </p><h2>table_ref</h2> <p>[] </p><h2>heading</h2> <p>Evaluation Datasets and Metrics </p><h2>text</h2> <p>We evaluate on three datasets which we describe below: </p><h2>publication_ref</h2> <p>[] </p><h2>figure_ref</h2> <p>[] </p\r\n######################\r\noutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}}
