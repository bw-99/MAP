Consider a positive integer k, and scalings K, P : N 0 → N 0 such that K n ≥ 2 for all n sufficiently large. With α : N 0 → R given by\nK 2 n P n = ln n + (k -1) ln ln n + α n n , n = 1, 2, . . . ,(20)\nthe following two properties hold. (a) If either there exists an ǫ > 0 such that n\nK 2 n\nPn > ǫ for all n sufficiently large, or lim n→∞ n K 2 n Pn = 0, then we have\nlim n→∞ P [G(n, K n , P n ) is k-connected ] = 0 if lim n→∞ α n = -∞. (b) If P n = Ω(n), then we have lim n→∞ P [G(n, K n , P n ) is k-connected ] = 1 if lim n→∞ α n = ∞.\nA proof of Corollary 2 can be found in Section IV-G.<h2>publication_ref</h2>['b32']<h2>figure_ref</h2>[]<h2>table_ref</h2>[]<h2>heading</h2>D. Discussion and Comparison with Related Results<h2>text</h2>As already noted in the literature [2], [11], [12], [32], [33], [39], Erdős-Rényi graph G(n, p n ) and random key graph G(n, K n , P n ) have similar k-connectivity properties when they are matched through their link probabilities; i.e. when p n = p s with p s as defined in (5). In particular, Erdős and Rényi [12] showed that if p n = ln n+(k-1) ln ln n+αn n , then G(n, p n ) is asymptotically almost surely k-connected (resp., not k-connected) if lim n→∞ α n = +∞ (resp., lim n→∞ α n = -∞). Similarly, Rybarczyk [33] has shown under some extra conditions (i.e.,\nP n = Θ(n ξ ) with ξ > 1) that if p s = ln n+(k-1) ln ln n+αn n , then G(n, K n , P n ) is almost surely k- connected (resp., not k-connected) if lim n→∞ α n = +∞ (resp., lim n→∞ α n = -∞).\nThe analogy between these two results could be exploited to conjecture similar k-connectivity results for our system model G on . To see this, recall from (3) that\nG on = G(n, K n , P n ) ∩ G(n, p n ).(21)\nSince G(n, K n , P n ) and G(n, p s ) have similar k-connectivity properties, it would seem intuitive to replace G(n, K n , P n ) with G(n, p s ) in the above equation (21). Then, using we would automatically obtain Theorem 1 via the aforementioned results of Erdős and Rényi [12]. Unfortunately, such heuristic approaches can not be taken for granted as G(n, K n , P n ) = G(n, p s ) in general. For instance, the two graphs are shown [38], [40] to exhibit quite different characteristics in terms of properties including clustering coefficient, number of triangles, etc. To this end, Theorem 1 formally validates the above intuition for the k-connectivity property, and it is worth mentioning that we establish Theorem 1 with a direct proof that does not rely on coupling arguments between random key graph and ER graph.\nG on ≃ G(n, p s ) ∩ G(n, p n ) = G(n, p n p s ) = G(n, p e ),\nWe now compare our results with those of Rybarczyk [33] for the k-connectivity of random key graph G(n, K n , P n ). As already noted, Rybarczyk [33, Remark 1, p. 5] has established an analog of Corollary 2, but under assumptions much stronger than ours. In particular, her result requires that P n = Θ(n ξ ) where ξ > 1. In comparison, Corollary 2 established here enforces only that P n ≥ Ω(n), which is clearly a much weaker condition than P n = Θ(n ξ ) with ξ > 1. More importantly, our condition P n ≥ Ω(n) requires (from (20)) only that K n = Ω( √ ln n) for the one-law to hold; i.e., for G on to be k-connected. However, the condition P n = Θ(n ξ ) with ξ > 1 enforced in [33] requires the key ring sizes to satisfy K n = Ω( √ n ξ-1 ln n) with ξ -1 > 0. This condition not only constitutes a much stronger requirement than K n = Ω( √ ln n), but it also renders the k-connectivity result given in [33] not applicable in the context of WSNs. This is because K n controls the number of keys kept in each sensor's memory, and should be very small [13] due to limited memory and computational capability of sensor nodes; in general K n = O(ln n) is accepted [9] as a\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}}
