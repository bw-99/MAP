Sorting the points from Fig. 2 \nk that µ(T k ) = m.\nWe prove the above stated theorem in several steps. First, we show that for selections the computation of choice can be simplified. It only requires to compute a simple integral instead of a double integral.\nIntegral Formula. If S is a measurable selection and µ(S) < +∞, then\ncho(S) = S (µ(S) -2 po(x))dµ(x).(1)\nProof. The fact that set S is a selection means that ∀y ∈ S : {x ∈ S|xR * y} = {x ∈ X|xR * y}. That is, any element x from X strictly preferable to any element y in S, also belong to S (x ∈ S). Using the definition of choice from Def. 2 and µ(S) < +∞ we obtain\ncho(S) = µ(S) 2 -2(µ × µ)({(x, y) ∈ S 2 |xR * y}) = µ(S) 2 -2(µ × µ)({(x, y) ∈ S × X|yR * x}).\nFubini's theorem [Halmos, 2013] indicates that\n(µ×µ)({(x, y) ∈ S × X|yR * x} = = S X 1 R * d(µ(y)) dµ(x) = S po(x)dµ(x),\nwhere 1 R * is the characteristic function of R *foot_5 .\nFinally, the integral formula results from the fact that µ(S) 2 -2 S po(x)dµ(x) = S (µ(S) -2 po(x))dµ(x).\nLet's now consider the function c defined on Σ for any A of finite measure by\nc(A) = A (µ(A) -2 po(x))dµ(x).\nThe integral formula defined in Eq. ( 1) means that for any selection S, we have c(S) = cho(S). The second step of our proof of Theorem 1 is to show that T k is the largest measurable set that maximizes c for its respective measure. More precisely, we will prove the following lemma. Lemma 1. For any k such as µ(T k ) < +∞ we have\nc(T k ) = max A∈Σ,µ(A)≤µ(T k ) c(A). Moreover, if µ(A) ≤ µ(T k ) and c(A) = c(T k ), then A ⊆ T k almost-everywhere.\nThe context of this lemma is very similar to the knapsack problem [Martello, 1990]. In this problem, one needs to find a subset A of a finite set of items {x 1 , ..., x n } maximizing the total value Σ xi∈A v(x i ) under the constraint that the total weight Σ xi∈A w(x i ) of A does not exceed a predefined maximum weight w * .\nIn Lemma 1, the total value is c(A), the ratio of an element's value to its weight becomes µ(A)-2 po(x), and the weight constraint is expressed as µ(A) ≤ µ(T k ).\nThe solutions given by the lemma correspond to those yielded for the knapsack problem by George Dantzig's greedy approximation algorithm [Dantzig, 1957]. This algorithm consists of ordering elements by decreasing value-to-weight ratio and then taking the N first elements. N is chosen in such a way, that taking one more element would cause excessive weight. The process of proving Lemma 1 is similar to proving that George Dantzig's solutions are optimal for their respective weights.\nProof of Lemma 1. Let's consider T k such that µ(T k ) < +∞. To prove c(T k ) is the maximum, we need to show for any\nA ∈ Σ, that c(A) ≤ c(T k ) if µ(A) ≤ µ(T k ). As A = (A ∩ T k ) ∪ (A \\ T k ) and T k = (A ∩ T k ) ∪ (T k \\ A), requiring c(A) ≤ c(T k ) is equivalent to requiring A\\T k (µ(A)-2 po(x))dµ(x) ≤ T k \\A (µ(T k )-2 po(x))dµ(x).\n(2) By definition of T k , we have that po\n(x) > k for x ∈ A \\ T k , while po(x) ≤ k for x ∈ T k \\ A. Therefore, A\\T k (µ(A) -2 po(x))dµ(x) ≤ µ(A \\ T k )(µ(A) -2k),\n(3) and\nT k \\A (µ(T k ) -2 po(x))dµ(x) ≥ µ(T k \\ A)(µ(T k ) -2k). (4) The constraint µ(A) ≤ µ(T k ) means that µ(A \\ T k ) ≤ µ(T k \\ A). Thus, we have µ(A \\ T k )(µ(A) -2k) ≤ µ(T k \\ A)(µ(T k ) -2k). (5)\nFinally, combining Eq. ( 5) with Eq. (3) and Eq. ( 4) guarantees the inequality in Eq. ( 2) under the constraint µ(A) ≤ µ(T k ).\nLet us now consider A ∈ Σ such that µ(A) ≤ µ(T k ) and c(A) = c(T k ). We now proceed to show that A ⊆ T k\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}}
