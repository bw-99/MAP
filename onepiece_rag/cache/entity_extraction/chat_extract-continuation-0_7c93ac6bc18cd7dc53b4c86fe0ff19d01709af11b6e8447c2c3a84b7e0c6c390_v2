These candidate items are then ranked and pruned in later stages of recommender systems using a more complex ranking model. As the top of the recommendation funnel, it is important to retrieve a high-recall candidate set to feed into downstream ranking models. A common approach is to leverage approximate nearest neighbor (ANN) search from a single dense query embedding; however, this approach this can yield a low-diversity result set with many near duplicates. As users often have multiple interests, candidate retrieval should ideally return a diverse set of candidates reflective of the user's multiple interests. To this end, we introduce kNN-Embed, a general approach to improving diversity in dense ANN-based retrieval. kNN-Embed represents each user as a smoothed mixture over learned item clusters that represent distinct \"interests\" of the user. By querying each of a user's mixture component in proportion to their mixture weights, we retrieve a high-diversity set of candidates reflecting elements from each of a user's interests. We experimentally compare kNN-Embed to standard ANN candidate retrieval, and show significant improvements in overall recall and improved diversity across three datasets. Accompanying this work, we open source a large Twitter follow-graph dataset1, to spur further research in graph-mining and representation learning for recommender systems.<h1>sections</h1><h2>heading</h2>Introduction<h2>text</h2>Recommendation systems for online services such as e-commerce or social networks present users with suggestions in the form of ranked lists of items [5].<h2>publication_ref</h2>['b4']<h2>figure_ref</h2>[]<h2>table_ref</h2>[]<h2>heading</h2>Related Works<h2>text</h2>Traditionally, techniques for candidate retrieval rely on fast, scalable approaches to search large collections for similar sparse vectors [3,1]. Approaches apply indexing and optimization strategies to scale sparse similarity search. One such strategy builds a static clustering of the entire collection of items; clusters are retrieved based on how well their centroids match the query [25,20]. These methods either (1) match the query against clusters of items and rank clusters based on similarity to query or (2) utilize clusters as a form of item smoothing.\nFor embedding-based recommender systems [28], large-scale dense similarity search has been applied for retrieval. Some approaches proposed utilize hashing-based techniques such as mapping input and targets to discrete partitions and selecting targets from the same partitions as inputs [26]. With the advent of fast approximate nearest-neighbor search [21,13], dense nearest neighbor has been applied by recommender systems for candidate retrieval [5].\nWhen utilizing graph-based embeddings for recommender systems [8], some methods transform single-mode embeddings to multiple modes by clustering user actions [23]. Our method extends upon this idea by incorporating nearest neighbor smoothing to address the sparsity problem of generating mixtures of embeddings for users with few engagements.\nSmoothing via k-nearest-neighbor search has been applied for better language modeling [16] and machine translation [15]. We smooth low-engagement user representations by leveraging engagements from similar users.<h2>publication_ref</h2>['b2', 'b0', 'b24', 'b19', 'b27', 'b25', 'b20', 'b12', 'b4', 'b7', 'b22', 'b15', 'b14']<h2>figure_ref</h2>[]<h2>table_ref</h2>[]<h2>heading</h2>kNN-Embed<h2>text</h2><h2>publication_ref</h2>[]<h2>figure_ref</h2>[]<h2>table_ref</h2>[]<h2>heading</h2>Preliminaries<h2>text</h2>Let U = {u 1 , u 2 , . . . u n } be the set of source entities (i.e., users in a recommender system) and I = {i 1 , i 2 , . . . i m } be the set of target entities (i.e., items in a recommender system). Let G constitute a bipartite graph representing the engagements between users (U) and items (I). For each user and item, we define a \"relevance\" variable in {0, 1} indicating an item's relevance to a particular user. An item is considered relevant to a particular user if a user, presented with an item, will engage with said item. Based on the engagements in G, each user, u j , is associated with a d-dimensional embedding vector u j ∈ R d ; similarly each target item i k is associated with an embedding vector i k ∈ R d . We call these the unimodal embeddings, and assume that they model user-item relevance p(relevance|u j , i k ) = f (u j , i k ) for a suitable function f .\nGiven the input user-item engagement graph, our goal is to learn mixtures of embeddings representations of users that better capture the multiple interests of a user as evidenced by higher recall in a candidate retrieval task.<h2>publication_ref</h2>[]\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>AHMED EL-KISHKY<|>PERSON<|>Ahmed El-Kishky is one of the authors of the paper titled 'kNN-Embed: Locally Smoothed Embedding Mixtures For Multi-interest Candidate Retrieval'.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>THOMAS MARKOVICH<|>PERSON<|>Thomas Markovich is one of the authors of the paper titled 'kNN-Embed: Locally Smoothed Embedding Mixtures For Multi-interest Candidate Retrieval'.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>KENNY LEUNG<|>PERSON<|>Kenny Leung is one of the authors of the paper titled 'kNN-Embed: Locally Smoothed Embedding Mixtures For Multi-interest Candidate Retrieval'.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>FRANK PORTMAN<|>PERSON<|>Frank Portman is one of the authors of the paper titled 'kNN-Embed: Locally Smoothed Embedding Mixtures For Multi-interest Candidate Retrieval'.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ARIA HAGHIGHI<|>PERSON<|>Aria Haghighi is one of the authors of the paper titled 'kNN-Embed: Locally Smoothed Embedding Mixtures For Multi-interest Candidate Retrieval'.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>YING XIAO<|>PERSON<|>Ying Xiao is one of the authors of the paper titled 'kNN-Embed: Locally Smoothed Embedding Mixtures For Multi-interest Candidate Retrieval'.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>KNN-EMBED<|>EVENT<|>kNN-Embed is a method introduced in the paper to improve diversity in candidate retrieval for recommendation systems.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>RECOMMENDATION SYSTEMS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Recommendation systems are systems that suggest items to users based on their preferences and behaviors.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>AHMED EL-KISHKY<|>KNN-EMBED<|>Ahmed El-Kishky is one of the authors who contributed to the development of the kNN-Embed method.<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>THOMAS MARKOVICH<|>KNN-EMBED<|>Thomas Markovich is one of the authors who contributed to the development of the kNN-Embed method.<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>KENNY LEUNG<|>KNN-EMBED<|>Kenny Leung is one of the authors who contributed to the development of the kNN-Embed method.<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>FRANK PORTMAN<|>KNN-EMBED<|>Frank Portman is one of the authors who contributed to the development of the kNN-Embed method.<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ARIA HAGHIGHI<|>KNN-EMBED<|>Aria Haghighi is one of the authors who contributed to the development of the kNN-Embed method.<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>YING XIAO<|>KNN-EMBED<|>Ying Xiao is one of the authors who contributed to the development of the kNN-Embed method.<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>KNN-EMBED<|>RECOMMENDATION SYSTEMS<|>kNN-Embed is a method used within recommendation systems to enhance candidate retrieval.<|>7)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
