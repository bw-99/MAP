Smooth and safe vehicle routing come on the top of the resident's demands due to their implications for their comfort and productivity on a daily bases. However, the popular route planning systems and service providers are not considering the road quality information while providing their trip planning services. In this paper, we presented \"iDriveSense\" a crowdsensing based system to enable such challenging demand. Our system benefits from the sensing capabilities of the vehicle motion sensors and the inertial sensors and GPS receivers to monitor road surface conditions. Accordingly, provides a cloud-based dynamic route planning services. The system was successfully able to operate independently or cooperatively with route planning service providers as Google Maps. The system can adequately asses the quality of road segments considering various aspects that affect the drivers' comfort and safety enabling efficient dynamic route planning while maintaining reasonable trip times and route distances. .<h2>publication_ref</h2>[]<h2>figure_ref</h2>[]<h2>table_ref</h2>[]<h1>references</h1><h2>ref_id</h2>b0<h2>title</h2>Digital Cities: Building the New Public Infrastructure (white paper)<h2>journal</h2>CISCO<h2>year</h2>2018-04<h2>authors</h2>J Barbier; K Delaney; N France<h2>ref_id</h2>b1<h2>title</h2>Enabling Communication Technologies for Smart Cities<h2>journal</h2>IEEE Commun.
