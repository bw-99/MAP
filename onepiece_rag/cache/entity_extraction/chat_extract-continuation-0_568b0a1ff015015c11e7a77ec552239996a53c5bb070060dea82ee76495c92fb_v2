Given the mathematical details in south Indian classical music and the task of arranging songs in a concert for a musician, we formulate this problem as session (concert)based playlist (song) recommendation and propose a network based recommender model. We give a network/graph representation for sequences in Indian classical music concerts with our proposed Raaga network. Along with features extracted from the network, the proposed model capture co-occurrences, melodic patterns, and musician's preference of flow in concerts as features. With experiments we show that inclusion of such features improve the performance of recommender model in constructing Indian classical music concerts.\nIn this work, we aim to solve following research questions by providing a music recommender framework for Indian classical music concerts:\n• How the concerts can be structured to understand its organization? We propose a network structure called Raaga Network that captures order, co-occurrence, and context of each item(song/raaga) in concerts. • Can historical data help musicians to build new repertoire? We postulate a network-based machine learning model to recommend items(songs/raagas) based on their underlying structure and mathematical constructs in Raaga Network. We frame this model to extract a set of recommendations for a given sequence of songs. • How useful are item(songs/raagas) recommendations given by the models? We evaluate the usefulness of recommendations from the proposed framework using offline methods like precision and discounted cumulative gain.<h2>publication_ref</h2>[]<h2>figure_ref</h2>[]<h2>table_ref</h2>[]<h2>heading</h2>II. RELATED WORK<h2>text</h2>Innovations in machine learning helped the scientific community to contribute to large scale recommendation systems like Pinterest [1] and Spotify [2]. All recommender systems fall in one of the three categories: content-based (domain dependent), collaborative (domain independent), and hybrid (multi-model frameworks) [3]. These algorithmically constructed systems are evaluated using either offline measures like precision, recall, mean average precision(MAP), Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain(nDCG) or online measures like A/B test and p-value [4].\nAdvancements in recommendation systems have been applied to music domain as well, Spotify and Pandora for example. The most popular problem in music recommendations is to select a set of songs as a playlist for a user based on their mood and preferred genre and artist [5]. This problem has been answered using multiple methods like: frequent pattern mining [6], collaborative filtering [7], and hybrid models [8]. IN addition to the playlist recommendation models are the session-based prediction models (i.e.), [9]- [11]. Novelty and diversity are considered to be important evaluation measures for music recommendation models [12] to provide the user interesting and unexplored suggestions. In this paper, we present a session-based recommendation model that utilizes deep learning algorithms to give recommendations.\nMachine learning has been used in the Indian classical music over the past decade to study multitude of concepts. For example, classifying recordings from YouTube based on the swara using random forest algorithm [13], using pitch information in music signals [14], and a vector based classification model [15], similar to text classification model. Identifying tonic of a music from multi-pitch analysis of the given audio was also given as a classification problem [16]. Unlike the existing methods, we describe methods through the lens of recommender systems. We incorporate the idea of embedding possible features from historical concerts and frequent pattern mining methods to make recommendations. Moreover, our model is designed as a human computer interaction system to communicate recommendations.<h2>publication_ref</h2>['b0', 'b1', 'b2', 'b3', 'b4', 'b5', 'b6', 'b7', 'b8', 'b10', 'b11', 'b12', 'b13', 'b14', 'b15']<h2>figure_ref</h2>[]<h2>table_ref</h2>[]<h2>heading</h2>III. BACKGROUND<h2>text</h2>Carnatic music is the classical music system of Southern India. The Carnatic music tradition is built on the melodic foundation of the ragam or scale that encompasses a collection of swaras (notes) in an octave. The scale follows a 12 note per octave system. This has been expanded into a 16 note system through the 72 melakarta scheme. The ragam system over the last 3 or more centuries has evolved into being categorized according to the mela janya scheme where by ragams are either parent scales or derivatives (mela or janya).\nA melakarta by definition will have the same notes in both its ascending and descending scales. The math in the organization of the melakarta scheme will give an idea of the variety of ragams available for musicians to learn, practice, and perform. A typical octave will have the 7 basic notes: S R G M P D N. The S and the P are fixed and static notes. R, G, M, D, N will have different variations lie R1, R2, R3, G1, G2, G3, M1, M2, D1, D2, D3, , N1, N2, N3. If one looks at the frequency values of these notes, R3 corresponds to G1 and D3 corresponds to N1. The melakarta scheme by definition will have a set of 7 notes with S and P constant. So the first ragam will be S R1, G1, M1, P, D1, N1, . The scheme also follows the rule that there will only be one variety of each note that is\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>RAAGA NETWORK<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The Raaga Network is a proposed network-based recommender model for arranging songs in Indian classical music concerts, capturing order, co-occurrence, and context of songs/raagas.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CARNATIC MUSIC<|>GEO<|>Carnatic music is the classical music system of Southern India, characterized by its melodic foundation based on ragas and a specific scale system.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>INDIAN CLASSICAL MUSIC<|>GEO<|>Indian classical music encompasses various musical traditions of India, including Carnatic and Hindustani music, and is known for its complex structures and improvisation.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SPOTIFY<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Spotify is a popular music streaming service that utilizes recommendation systems to suggest songs and playlists to users based on their preferences.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PANDORA<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Pandora is a music streaming and internet radio service that offers personalized music recommendations based on user preferences and listening habits.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MACHINE LEARNING<|>EVENT<|>Machine learning is a field of artificial intelligence that involves the use of algorithms and statistical models to enable computers to perform tasks without explicit instructions, often applied in recommendation systems.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>RAAGA NETWORK<|>CARNATIC MUSIC<|>The Raaga Network is designed to enhance the organization and recommendation of songs within the context of Carnatic music concerts<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>RAAGA NETWORK<|>INDIAN CLASSICAL MUSIC<|>The Raaga Network serves as a framework for recommending songs in Indian classical music concerts, focusing on the unique aspects of this musical tradition<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SPOTIFY<|>INDIAN CLASSICAL MUSIC<|>Spotify utilizes recommendation systems that can be applied to Indian classical music, suggesting playlists based on user preferences<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PANDORA<|>INDIAN CLASSICAL MUSIC<|>Pandora's recommendation algorithms can also be adapted to suggest Indian classical music based on user listening habits<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MACHINE LEARNING<|>RAAGA NETWORK<|>Machine learning techniques are employed in the Raaga Network to improve the accuracy of song recommendations<|>7)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
