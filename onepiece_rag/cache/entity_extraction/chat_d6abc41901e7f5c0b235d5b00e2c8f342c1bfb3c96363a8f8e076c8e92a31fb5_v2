In this case, all three cases of the definition in Eq. ( 10 Finally, it is possible to show that the total run time of the k-Pareto optimality based sorting is O((ng + nh + M )ps log ps).<h2>publication_ref</h2>['b35']<h2>figure_ref</h2>[]<h2>table_ref</h2>[]<h2>heading</h2>C.5 Exploratory Database Queries<h2>text</h2>Simple database queries q, objectives, and constraints in optimization problems often consist in requiring a continuous attribute to be in a given interval, or a discrete attribute to be equal to a given value. Conceptually, those queries are boolean functions. Complex queries are often conjunctions of the form r = q 1 ∧ q 2 ∧ • • • ∧ q n .\nIn our formalism, these simple queries translate into simple pre-order relations of the form xRy. Requiring an element to be in an interval can be represented by xR q y iff x is in the desired interval, or x is not situated further from the interval than yfoot_11 . Requiring an attribute to be equal to a given value translates into the relation xR q y if for x the attribute takes the required valuefoot_12 . Complex queries then translate into the composite relations of the form R r = R q1 ∧ R q2 ∧ • • • ∧ R qn . The simple sub-relations R q2 are pre-order relations, and, therefore, R r is also a pre-order relation and is transitive. However, these relations are not partial order relations, as reflexivity does not necessarily hold. A \"topological\" sorting according to our partial order relation R r can be viewed as a valid fuzzy relaxation of the strict functional query. There are many possible fuzzy relaxations and the problem is to find one that is suitable for a given application. The k-Pareto optimality is one of such fuzzy extensions of the query. It is 0 if all criteria are satisfied, and higher values of k-Pareto optimality indicate worse results. The maximum choice theorem applies here, and the user is offered the maximum choice. This is of particular interest for exploratory queries, such as job search, especially, if there are no items in the database that satisfy all the criteria. Direct brute-force search for selections offering maximum choice is unfeasible as there are too many selections to consider.\nMoreover, in the above formalism, one can treat classical optimization objectives in the same way. Maximizing an attribute x can be represented by the relation xRy iff x ≥ y, and the minimization can be represented by the relation ≤. In the above framework, negation can be represented via the relation R -1 defined by xR -1 y iff yRx.<h2>publication_ref</h2>[]<h2>figure_ref</h2>[]<h2>table_ref</h2>[]<h2>heading</h2>C.6 Scheduling Algorithms<h2>text</h2>In the case of scheduling algorithms, xRy can be given the meaning 'x depends on y'. Then, selections represent sets of tasks that remain to be processed. Having a large choice means having much freedom to parallelize tasks or having flexibility in case the rescheduling is required.<h2>publication_ref</h2>[]<h2>figure_ref</h2>[]<h2>table_ref</h2>[]<h2>heading</h2>Supplementary Materials A Further Examples for Simple Relations and Measures<h2>text</h2>In the first two supplementary examples, we consider a situation typical in economics or multi-objective optimization. Later, we show how the proposed concepts apply to arbitrary transitive relations.<h2>publication_ref</h2>[]<h2>figure_ref</h2>[]<h2>table_ref</h2>[]<h2>heading</h2>A.1 Continuous Measures<h2>text</h2>Let us again consider R as defined in Section 2.3. The relation R models preference for small values of x 1 and x 2 . However, instead of assuming X to be a finite subset of R 2 , we now study the unit square [0, 1] × [0, 1] with three continuous measures: the Lebesgue area measure dx 1 dx 2 , as well as 2x 2 dx 1 dx 2 and 4x 1 x 2 dx 1 dx 2 . In each case, the total measure of the unit square equals to one. The Lebesgue area measure represents elements with two uniformly distributed characteristics x 1 and x 2 ; 2x 2 dx 1 dx 2 represents rarefaction of items having small values of x 2 , whereas 4x 1 x 2 dx 1 dx 2 represents rarefaction of items having small values of both x 1 and x 2 .\nFor each of the cases defined above, in Fig. 8a we show the set of at least k-Pareto optimal elements of measure 0.1, which corresponds to selecting the 10 best percent. All three sets demonstrate the qualitative behaviours expected from sets delimited by indifference curves when the corresponding rarefaction occurs. Indeed, the curve corresponding to the uniform distribution and the Lebesgue area measure dx 1 dx 2 is symmetric. Also, in this case, po(x 1 , x 1 ) = x 1 x 2 , and the sets of at least k-Pareto optimal elements are the sets situated below arcs of hyperbola defined by the equation x 1 x 2 = k, see\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}}
