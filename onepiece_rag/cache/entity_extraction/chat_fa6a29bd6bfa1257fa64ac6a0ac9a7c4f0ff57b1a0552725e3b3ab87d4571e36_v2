In this work, we focus on Ricci curvature for graph convolution and edge-based filtering. Several definitions have been proposed about Ricci curvature, including Ollivier Ricci curvature [58], Forman Ricci curvature [21], Balanced Forman curvature [74]. Ricci curvature controls the overlap between two distance balls by considering the radii of the balls and the distance between their centers [33]. Furthermore, the lower bound of Ricci curvature can reveal valuable global geometric and topological information [4]. It is also an effective indicator of treelike, flat, and cyclic areas, making it well-suited for integration into hyperbolic space to capture asymmetries, biases, and hierarchies.\nOverall, we put forward a novel framework: curvature-aware hyperbolic graph convolutional neural network (𝜅HGCN) for effectively modeling tree-like datasets with complex structures. Specifically, 𝜅HGCN leverages the discrete Ricci curvature to guide message passing and dynamically adapts the global continuous hyperbolic curvature. Through empirical evaluations on diverse datasets and tasks, we confirm the superiority of the 𝜅HGCN, as it consistently outperforms existing baselines by substantial margins. The major contributions of this work are summarized as follows:\n• We design a novel hyperbolic geometric learning framework that encapsulates the graph Ricci curvature into the continuous embedding space, producing less distortion, powerful expressiveness, and topology-aware embeddings; • We present a new message technique for hyperbolic graph embedding, and we further prove that it produces a smaller (larger) embedding distance when larger (smaller) curvature is involved, which well handles the inconsistency between the local structure and global curvature of embedding space; • Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed model 𝜅HGCN achieves significant improvements over various baselines on link prediction and node classification tasks. </p><h2>publication_ref</h2> <p>['b0', 'b2', 'b43', 'b52', 'b63', 'b100', 'b10', 'b23', 'b44', 'b55', 'b56', 'b60', 'b64', 'b89', 'b95', 'b81', 'b102', 'b25', 'b39', 'b57', 'b20', 'b73', 'b32', 'b3'] </p><h2>figure_ref</h2> <p>['fig_0', 'fig_1'] </p><h2>table_ref</h2> <p>[] </p><h2>heading</h2> <p>RELATED WORK </p><h2>text</h2> <p>For tree-likeness modeling, we mainly review the latest research techniques including graph neural networks and hyperbolic geometry.

In recent years, graph neural networks (GNNs) have gained significant attention within the graph learning community. The main concept behind GNNs is a message-passing mechanism that aggregates information from neighboring nodes. GNNs have demonstrated remarkable performance in various tasks, including node classification, link prediction, graph classifications, and graph reconstruction [23,25,28,35,41,42,48,52,67,69,78,88,95,[98][99][100]. They have also found wide applications in recommender systems, anomaly detection, social networks analysis, and more [12-16, 20, 35, 49, 66, 68, 69, 92]. The majority of GNNs learn graphs in Euclidean space due to their computational advantages and intuitiveness.
