Moreover, our proposed frameworks, k 2 U and k 2 Q, provide a solid mathematical foundation for deriving polynomialtime utilization-based schedulability tests and response time analyses almost automatically. That is, utilization-based analyses are almost automatically derived if the schedulability tests can be formulated in the scope of the frameworks. We have demonstrated several applications in this paper. Some models have introduced pretty high dynamics, but we can still handle the response time analysis and schedulability test with proper constructions so that the k 2 Q framework is applicable. Therefore, with the presented approach, some difficult schedulability test and response time analysis problems may be solved by building a good (or exact) exponential-time test and using the approximation in the k 2 Q framework. With the quadratic and hyperbolic expressions, k 2 Q and k 2 U frameworks can be used to provide many quantitive features to be measured, like the total utilization bounds, speed-up factors, etc., not only for uniprocessor scheduling but also for multiprocessor scheduling.\nWhen adopting k 2 Q for schedulability tests, we assume that t k is specified in Lemma 1. In this paper, we do not explore how to configure the best value of t k and its last release time ordering π such that the resulting quadratic form is the best. Therefore, the combination of k 2 Q/k 2 U and the tunable approach by Bini and Buttazzo [12] can be an interesting future research direction, as this can potentially balance the schedulability test and the time complexity for concrete applications. Appendix A: Proofs Proof of Lemma 5. Similar to the proof of Lemma 4, we only have to consider the cases when U i is set to x k-1 to make the schedulability condition the most difficult, where x = k-1 i=1 U i . Suppose that C k t k is y. Then, we are looking for the infimum x + y such that y > 1 -(α + β)x + 0.5αβ(x 2 + x 2 k-1 ). To solve this, we start with y = 1-(α+β)x+0.5αβ(x 2 + x 2 k-1 ). Our objective becomes to minimize\nH(x) = x + 1 - (α + β)x + 0.5αβ(x 2 + x 2 k-1 ). By finding dH(x) dx = 1 -(α + β) + kαβx k-1 = 0, we know that x = (k-1)(α+β-1)<h2>publication_ref</h2>['b11']<h2>figure_ref</h2>[]<h2>table_ref</h2>[]<h2>heading</h2>kαβ<h2>text</h2>. Therefore,\ny =1 -x α + β - 0.5kαβ (k-1)(α+β-1) kαβ k -1 =1 - (k -1)(α + β -1) kαβ (0.5(α + β + 1)) =1 - 0.5(k -1) (α + β) 2 -1 kαβ . (36\n)\nSince α+β ≥ 1, we know that x ≥ 0. Whether we should take the above solution only depends on whether y ≥ 0 or not. If y ≥ 0, then we can conclude the solution directly; otherwise, if y < 0, we should set y to 0. That is, by reorganizing Eq. ( 36) (under the assumption α > 0 and β > 0), examining whether 2 -1 due to the assumption α+β ≥ 1. Therefore, there are two cases:\ny < 0 is equivalent to testing (1 -1 k ) (α + β) 2 -1 > 2αβ, which implies to test whether α 2 +β 2 -1 > 1 k (α + β) 2 -1 . If α 2 + β 2 ≤ 1, then y ≥ 0 since α 2 + β 2 -1 ≤ 0 ≤ 1 k (α + β)\nCase 1: If α 2 + β 2 > 1 and k > (α+β) 2 -1 α 2 +β 2 -1\n, then, for such a case y derived from Eq. ( 36) is negative. We should set y to 0. The remaining procedure here is the same as in solving the quadratic equation in the proof of Lemma 4 by setting C k t k to 0. This leads to the first condition in Eq. (19).\nCase 2: If α 2 + β 2 ≤ 1 or k ≤ (α+β) 2 -1 α 2 +β 2 -1\n, then, we have the conclusion that y ≥ 0 and x ≥ 0. We just have to sum up the above derived x and y. This leads to the second condition in Eq. ( 19) directly.\nProof of Lemma 6.
