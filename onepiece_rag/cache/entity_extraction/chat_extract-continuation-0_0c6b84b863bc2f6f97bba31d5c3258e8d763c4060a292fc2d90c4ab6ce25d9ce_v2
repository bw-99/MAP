It is reported that Pearson correlation performs better than the others [5,6]. The Pearson correlation coefficient is used here, defined as follows [3,7] sim\n(u, v) = i∈I (r u,i -ru )(r v,i -rv ) i∈I (r u,i -ru ) 2 i∈I (r v,i -rv ) 2 , (2\n) where I denotes the set of items that users u and v have corated.\nIn practical applications, users in general only rate a small portion of items, but accurate recommendations are expected for the cold users who rate only a few items. This raises two inherent obstacles to obtain satisfactory recommending quality, namely data sparsity and cold start [8][9][10][11]. In principle, this is caused by the lack of sufficient and reliable elements in U and/or I to calculate Eqns.( 1) and (2). A possible solution to get around this is to incorporate trust relationships into the CF framework, resulting in the trust based or trust-aware CF (TaCF) [8][9][10][12][13][14]. The underlying intuition supporting the working of trust-aware recommender systems (TaRS) is that users often accept advice from trustworthy friends in real life on topics they are not expert in. So it is reasonable to expect that considering trust relationship among users may bring in benefits in generating recommendations. Furthermore, trust can be propagated over a network of users, hence TaRS can overcome the data sparsity and cold start problems, from which traditional CF methods suffer, at least in concept.\nA practical issue to be considered when designing a TaCF algorithm is that the explicit trust information is usually much more sparse than the users' ratings. A trust propagation model along with an effective implicit trust inference method is desirable to overcome the above limitation. To this end, this paper presents an applicable implicit trust inference method, based on which an improved CF algorithm termed iTrace (i.e., Implicit TRust-Aware Collaborative filtEring) is proposed.<h2>publication_ref</h2>['b0', 'b1', 'b2', 'b3', 'b1', 'b4', 'b5', 'b2', 'b6', 'b7', 'b8', 'b9', 'b10', 'b1', 'b7', 'b8', 'b9', 'b11', 'b12', 'b13']<h2>figure_ref</h2>[]<h2>table_ref</h2>[]<h2>heading</h2>THE PROPOSED ITRACE ALGORITHM<h2>text</h2>In this section, we present the iTrace algorithm followed by an analysis of its connections to existent related work.<h2>publication_ref</h2>[]<h2>figure_ref</h2>[]<h2>table_ref</h2>[]<h2>heading</h2>Algorithm Design<h2>text</h2>An architecture of the iTrace algorithm is shown in Fig. 1. The inputs include an N × N explicit trust matrix and an N × M rating matrix, denoted in what follows by T e and R, respectively. N and M denote the numbers of the users and of the items, respectively. In contrast with a standard CF algorithm, iTrace leverages much more information except user similarity for prediction of user rating. Such additional information is represented by a trust matrix, denoted by T in what follows, which is estimated by an implicit trust inference module that takes T e as input. The details on the implicit trust inference module are presented in Sec.2.2. A working flow of the iTrace algorithm for predicting user u's rating value on item i is summarized as follows.\n1. Calculate the similarity metrics between u and the other users who rated i using Eqn.(2).\n2. Select the top K users who are most similar to u as u's voting users.\n3. Estimate the trust of u on every voting user, using the implicit trust inference method presented in Sec. 2.2.\n4. Predict user u's rating value on item i as follows\nr u,i = ru + v∈U f (sim(u, v), t(u, v))(r v,i -rv ) v∈U |f (sim(u, v), t(u, v))| ,(3)\nwhere t(u, v) is the estimated trust of u on v, obtained from Step 3. The function f plays a role of integrating user similarity and trust in rating prediction.\nWe consider two different forms of the function f in our algorithm. The first one, termed incremental weighting (IW) here, is specified as follows\nf (sim(u, v), t(u, v)) = sim(u, v) t(u, v) j∈U sim(u, j) t(u, j) .(4)\nThe standard CF framework corresponds to a special case in which t(u, i) = t(u, j) for ∀i, j ∈ U . The other form of f under consideration, termed linear weighting (LW) here, is\nf (sim(u, v), t(u, v)) = αsim(u, v) j∈U sim(u, j) + (1 -α) t(u, v) j∈U t(u, j) ,(5)\nwhere 0 ≤ α ≤ 1 denotes the linear weighting coefficient. The standard CF algorithm then corresponds to the case in which α = 1. Through the analysis on Eqns.( 4) and ( 5), we see that the standard CF framework totally neglects the impact of the user trust. We show that in this\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>ITRACE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>iTrace is an implicit trust-aware collaborative filtering algorithm designed to improve recommendation quality by incorporating trust relationships among users.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>USER<|>PERSON<|>Users are individuals who rate items and can influence recommendations through their trust relationships.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>TRUST MATRIX<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The trust matrix is a representation of the trust relationships among users, used as input for the iTrace algorithm.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>RATING MATRIX<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The rating matrix contains user ratings for items, which is utilized by the iTrace algorithm to make predictions.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>COLD START<|>EVENT<|>Cold start refers to the challenge of providing recommendations for new users who have rated only a few items.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DATA SPARSITY<|>EVENT<|>Data sparsity is the issue arising from users rating only a small portion of items, complicating the recommendation process.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ITRACE<|>TRUST MATRIX<|>iTrace uses the trust matrix to enhance its recommendation capabilities by incorporating user trust relationships<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ITRACE<|>RATING MATRIX<|>iTrace utilizes the rating matrix to predict user ratings based on the ratings provided by similar users<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>USER<|>ITRACE<|>Users interact with the iTrace algorithm by providing ratings and establishing trust relationships<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>COLD START<|>ITRACE<|>The iTrace algorithm aims to address the cold start problem by leveraging trust relationships among users<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>DATA SPARSITY<|>ITRACE<|>iTrace is designed to overcome data sparsity issues by incorporating trust relationships into the recommendation process<|>6)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
