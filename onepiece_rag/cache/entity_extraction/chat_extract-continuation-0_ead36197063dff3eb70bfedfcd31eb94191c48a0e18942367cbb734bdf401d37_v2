Its applications span various domains [50,61,90], including computer vision [5,30,34], natural language processing [8,10,36,51,56,57,62], recommender systems [14,70,80,81,87,91], graph learning [7,11,27,43,45,89,96] and more [84]. In the graph learning domain, recent works [11,43,45,47,89,92,96,97] have generalized graph neural networks to hyperbolic space and demonstrated impressive performance, particularly on tree-like data. Some studies [60,71,82,103] propose learning graph in different embedding spaces or product spaces. Furthermore, researchers have also explored the use of ultrahyperbolic geometry for graph learning [38,39,85,86]. However, many existing methods fail to consider the local heterogeneous structure of graphs, resulting in significant distortion and low-quality embeddings.<h2>publication_ref</h2>['b16', 'b101', 'b36', 'b62', 'b71', 'b72', 'b49', 'b60', 'b89', 'b4', 'b29', 'b33', 'b7', 'b9', 'b35', 'b50', 'b55', 'b56', 'b61', 'b13', 'b69', 'b79', 'b80', 'b86', 'b90', 'b6', 'b10', 'b26', 'b42', 'b44', 'b88', 'b95', 'b83', 'b10', 'b42', 'b44', 'b46', 'b88', 'b91', 'b95', 'b96', 'b59', 'b70', 'b81', 'b102', 'b37', 'b38', 'b84', 'b85']<h2>figure_ref</h2>[]<h2>table_ref</h2>[]<h2>heading</h2>Graph Curvature<h2>text</h2>Graph curvature, resembling curvature in continuous geometry, includes Gaussian curvature, Ricci curvature, and average curvature. Each of these elements serves a distinct purpose: Gaussian curvature measures local curvature at vertices, Ricci curvature assigns curvature to edges, and average curvature offers a global measure for the entire graph. Applications of graph curvatures span various domains in network alignment, congestion and vulnerability detection, community detection, and robustness analysis [32,54,55].\nThe recent work of curvature graph neural network (CurvGN) [93] introduced the notion of Ricci curvature into the field of graph learning. The study in [74] showed that edges with negative curvature can contribute to the over-squashing problem in graph embeddings. Coinciding with the announcement of the accepted papers for WWW 2023, we noted a parallel work by Fu et al. [22] that introduces the idea of class-aware Ricci curvature for addressing hierarchy-imbalance in node classification, while in our work, we aim to explore the integration of more generalized ricci curvature with hyperbolic graph convolution and curvature-based filtering mechanism to enhance the performance of HGCN for a more range of tasks, including node classification and link prediction.<h2>publication_ref</h2>['b31', 'b53', 'b54', 'b92', 'b73', 'b21']<h2>figure_ref</h2>[]<h2>table_ref</h2>[]<h2>heading</h2>BACKGROUND<h2>text</h2>In this part, we first briefly review the necessary definitions of differential geometry, primarily concentrating on hyperbolic geometry. A thorough and in-depth explanation can be found in [40]. We also give a short introduction about Ollivier Ricci curvature (ORC), which is a generalized Ricci curvature tailored for discrete objects (e.g., graphs) 1 . The readers may refer to [58] for more details.<h2>publication_ref</h2>['b39', 'b57']<h2>figure_ref</h2>[]<h2>table_ref</h2>[]<h2>heading</h2>Riemannian Geometry<h2>text</h2>Manifold and Tangent Space. Riemannian geometry, a subfield of differential geometry, denoted as M with a Riemannian metric 𝑔. An 𝑛-dimensional manifold (M, 𝑔) represents a smooth and real space, essentially an extension of a 2-D surface to higher dimensions, that can be locally approximated by R 𝑛 . For any point x on M, we define a tangent space T x M, acting as the first-order approximation of M in the vicinity of x. This tangent space is an 𝑛-dimensional vector space that is isomorphic to R 𝑛 . The metric 𝑔 on the Riemannian \n𝐿(𝛾) = ∫ 𝛽 𝛼 ∥𝛾 ′ (𝑡)∥ 𝑔 𝑑𝑡. Then the distance of u, v ∈ M, 𝑑 M (u, v) = inf 𝐿(𝛾) where 𝛾 is a curve that 𝛾 (𝑎) = u, 𝛾 (𝑏) = v.\nMaps and Parallel Transport. The maps define the relationship between the hyperbolic space and the corresponding tangent space.
