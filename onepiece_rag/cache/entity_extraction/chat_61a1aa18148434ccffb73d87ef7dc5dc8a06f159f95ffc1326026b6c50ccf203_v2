NUMERICAL EXPERIMENTS We present numerical experiments to back up our theoretical results. Figure 1 depicts the probability that graph G(n, X, Y ) is k-connected. We let X vary, with other parameters fixed at n = 3, 000, Y = 30, 000 and k = 3, 7. The empirical probabilities corresponding to the experimental curves are obtained as follows: we count the times of k-connectivity out of 500 independent samples of G(n, X, Y ), and derive the empirical probability through dividing its corresponding count by 500. For the theoretical curves, we first compute α by setting the edge probability 1 -\n( Y -X X ) ( Y X )\n(viz., (45) in the Appendix) as ln n+(k-1) ln ln n+α n and then use e -e -α (k-1)! as the theoretical value for the probability of k-connectivity. Figure 1 confirms our analytical results as the experimental and theoretical curves are close.\nV. RELATED WORK For a random key graph G(n, X n , Y n ), Rybarczyk [6] derives the asymptotically exact probabilities of connectivity and of the property that the minimum node degree is no less than 1, covering a weaker form of the results -the zero-one laws which are also obtained in [2], [10]. As demonstrated in [6], in G(n, X n , Y n ) with X n ≥ 2, Xn 2 Yn = ln n+αn n and lim n→∞ α n = α * , the probability of connectivity and that of the minimum degree being at least 1 both approach to e -e -α * as n → ∞. Rybarczyk [7] implicitly obtains zeroone laws (but not the asymptotically exact probabilities) for k-connectivity and for the property that the minimum degree is at least k. The implicit result is that if X n Θ(n β ) for some  , graph G(n, X n , Y n ) has (resp., does not have) the two properties with probability approaching to 1, given that α n tends to ∞ (resp., -∞) as n → ∞. Our Corollary 1 significantly improves her result [7] in the following two aspects: (i) we cover the wide range of X n ≥ 2 all n sufficiently large, instead of the much stronger condition X n = Ω (ln n) 3 in [7] (note that the analysis under X n = 1 is trivial), and (ii) we establish not only zero-one laws for k-connectivity and the minimum degree, but also the asymptotically exact probabilities. The latter results are not given by Rybarczyk [7]. Recently, we [14] give the asymptotically exact probability of k-connectivity in graph G(n, X n , Y n ) under X n = Ω( √ ln n ) through a rather involved proof. We improve this result to cover X n ≥ 2 through a simpler proof and fill the gap where X n is at least 2, but is not Ω( √ ln n ). This improvement is of technical interest as well as of practical importance since random key graphs have been used in diverse applications including modeling the Eschenauer-Gligor random key predistribution scheme (the most recognized solution to secure communication in wireless sensor networks).\n[G(n, X, Y ) is k-connected] k = 3 (Theoretical) k = 3 (Experimental) k = 7 (Theoretical) k = 7 (Experimental)<h2>publication_ref</h2>['b7', 'b7', 'b10', 'b8', 'b5', 'b1', 'b9', 'b5', 'b6', 'b6', 'b6', 'b6', 'b13']<h2>figure_ref</h2>['fig_1', 'fig_1']<h2>table_ref</h2>[]<h2>heading</h2>VI. CONCLUSION<h2>text</h2>In this paper, for a random key graph, we derive the asymptotically exact probabilities for two properties with an arbitrary k: (i) the graph is k-connected; and (ii) each node has at least k neighboring nodes.
