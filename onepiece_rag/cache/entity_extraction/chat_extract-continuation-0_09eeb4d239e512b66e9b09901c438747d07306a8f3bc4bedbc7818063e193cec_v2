An ultimate automation target of software maintenance is then the systematization of patch generation for user-reported bugs. Although this ambition is aligned with the momentum of automated program repair, the literature has, so far, mostly focused on generate-andvalidate setups where fault localization and patch generation are driven by a well-defined test suite. On the one hand, however, the common (yet strong) assumption on the existence of relevant test cases does not hold in practice for most development settings: many bugs are reported without the available test suite being able to reveal them. On the other hand, for many projects, the number of bug reports generally outstrips the resources available to triage them. Towards increasing the adoption of patch generation tools by practitioners, we investigate a new repair pipeline, iFixR, driven by bug reports: (1) bug reports are fed to an IR-based fault localizer; (2) patches are generated from fix patterns and validated via regression testing; (3) a prioritized list of generated patches is proposed to developers. We evaluate iFixR on the Defects4J dataset, which we enriched (i.e., faults are linked to bug reports) and carefullyreorganized (i.e., the timeline of test-cases is naturally split). iFixR generates genuine/plausible patches for 21/44 Defects4J faults with its IR-based fault localizer. iFixR accurately places a genuine/plausible patch among its top-5 recommendation for 8/13 of these faults (without using future test cases in generation-and-validation). </p><h1>sections</h1><h2>heading</h2> <p>INTRODUCTION </p><h2>text</h2> <p>Automated program repair (APR) has gained incredible momentum in the last decade. Since the seminal work by Weimer et al. [83] who relied on genetic programming to evolve program variants until one variant is found to satisfy the functional constraints of a test suite, the community has been interested in test-based techniques to repair programs without specifications. Thus, various approaches [12,13,18,19,25,26,32,33,38,45,48,49,52,53,55,62,65,83,84,92,93] have been proposed in the literature aiming at reducing manual debugging efforts through automatically generating patches. Beyond fixing syntactic errors, i.e., cases where the code violates some programming language specifications [16], the current challenges lie in fixing semantic bugs, i.e., cases where implementation of program behavior deviates from developer's intention [22,61].\nTen years ago, the work of Weimer et al. [83] was explicitly motivated by the fact that, despite significant advances in specification mining (e.g., [40]), formal specifications are rarely available. Thus, test suites represented an affordable approximation to program specifications. Unfortunately, the assumption that test cases are readily available still does not hold in practice [7,27,68]. Therefore, while current test-based APR approaches would be suitable in a test-driven development setting [6], their adoption by practitioners faces a simple reality: developers majoritarily (1) write few tests [27], (2) write tests after the source code [7], and (3) write tests to validate that bugs are indeed fixed and will not reoccur [23].\nAlthough APR bots [79] can come in handy in a continuous integration environment, the reality is that bug reports remain the main source of the stream of bugs that developers struggle to handle daily [5]. Bugs are indeed reported in natural language, where users tentatively describe the execution scenario that was being carried out and the unexpected outcome (e.g., crash stack traces). Such bug reports constitute an essential artifact within a software development cycle and can become an overwhelming concern for maintainers. For example, as early as in 2005, a triager of the Mozilla project was reported in [5, page 363] to have commented that: \"Everyday, almost 300 bugs appear that need triaging. This is far too much for only the Mozilla programmers to handle.\" However, very few studies [9,43] have undertaken to automate patch generation based on bug reports. To the best of our knowledge, Liu et al. [43] proposed the most advanced study in this direction. Unfortunately, their R2Fix approach carries several caveats: as illustrated in Figure 1, it focuses on perfect bug reports [43,  The trailing zero (`\\0') will be written to state [4] which is out of bound.\nlinux/net/mac80211/debugfs_sta.c: -strcpy(state, \"off \"); + strcpy(state, \"off\");\n(a) Linux Kernel Bug Report (b) Patch to Fix the Bug </p><h2>publication_ref</h2> <p>['b82', 'b11', 'b12', 'b17', 'b18', 'b24', 'b25', 'b31', 'b32', 'b37', 'b44', 'b47', 'b48', 'b51', 'b52', 'b54', 'b61', 'b64', 'b82', 'b83', 'b91', 'b92', 'b15', 'b21', 'b60', 'b82', 'b39', 'b6', 'b26', 'b67', 'b5', 'b26', 'b1', 'b6', 'b22', 'b78', 'b4', 'b8', 'b42', 'b42'] </p><h2>figure_ref</h2> <p>['fig_1']\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>ISSUE TRACKING SYSTEMS<|>concept<|>Issue tracking systems are tools used in software development to collect feedback from users and developers regarding bugs and issues in the software.)\n(\"entity\"<|>PATCH GENERATION<|>concept<|>Patch generation refers to the process of creating updates or fixes for software to address bugs reported by users or developers.)\n(\"entity\"<|>AUTOMATED PROGRAM REPAIR<|>concept<|>Automated program repair (APR) is a field focused on automatically generating patches to fix bugs in software without human intervention.)\n(\"entity\"<|>iFIXR<|>concept<|>iFixR is a new repair pipeline that utilizes bug reports to drive the process of fault localization and patch generation.)\n(\"entity\"<|>DEFECTS4J DATASET<|>concept<|>The Defects4J dataset is a collection of real-world bugs in Java programs used for evaluating automated program repair techniques.)\n(\"entity\"<|>IR-BASED FAULT LOCALIZER<|>concept<|>An IR-based fault localizer is a tool that uses information retrieval techniques to identify the location of faults in code based on bug reports.)\n(\"entity\"<|>REGRESSION TESTING<|>concept<|>Regression testing is a type of software testing that ensures that previously developed and tested software still performs after a change.)\n(\"entity\"<|>BUG REPORTS<|>concept<|>Bug reports are documents created by users or developers that describe issues or bugs encountered in software, often including details about the execution scenario and unexpected outcomes.)\n(\"entity\"<|>SEMANTIC BUGS<|>concept<|>Semantic bugs are errors in software where the implementation does not align with the intended behavior as defined by the developer.)\n(\"entity\"<|>TEST SUITE<|>concept<|>A test suite is a collection of test cases designed to validate that a software program behaves as expected.)\n(\"relationship\"<|>ISSUE TRACKING SYSTEMS<|>PATCH GENERATION<|>Issue tracking systems are used to collect feedback that informs the patch generation process for reported bugs<|>8)\n(\"relationship\"<|>PATCH GENERATION<|>AUTOMATED PROGRAM REPAIR<|>Patch generation is a key component of automated program repair, aiming to fix bugs without manual intervention<|>9)\n(\"relationship\"<|>iFIXR<|>BUG REPORTS<|>iFixR utilizes bug reports as input to drive its fault localization and patch generation processes<|>8)\n(\"relationship\"<|>DEFECTS4J DATASET<|>iFIXR<|>The Defects4J dataset is used to evaluate the effectiveness of the iFixR repair pipeline<|>7)\n(\"relationship\"<|>IR-BASED FAULT LOCALIZER<|>iFIXR<|>The IR-based fault localizer is a component of the iFixR pipeline that identifies faults based on bug reports<|>8)\n(\"relationship\"<|>REGRESSION TESTING<|>PATCH GENERATION<|>Regression testing is performed to validate the patches generated during the patch generation process<|>7)\n(\"relationship\"<|>BUG REPORTS<|>SEMANTIC BUGS<|>Bug reports often describe semantic bugs, where the software behavior deviates from the developer's intention<|>6)\n(\"relationship\"<|>TEST SUITE<|>AUTOMATED PROGRAM REPAIR<|>Automated program repair techniques often rely on test suites to validate the correctness of generated patches<|>7) \n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
