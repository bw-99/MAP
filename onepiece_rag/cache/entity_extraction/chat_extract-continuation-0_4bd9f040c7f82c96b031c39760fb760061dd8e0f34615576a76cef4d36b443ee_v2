It means that PO-count yields a population covering the same hypervolume as NSGA-II. Contrarily, PO-prob improves the hypervolume, as compared to NSGA-II. This difference is visible for small n k (+4% for n k = 2) and is especially prominent for large n k (+60% for n k = 25). For n k between 13 https://deap.readthedocs.io/en/master/ 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8  5 and 7, PO-prob results in lower values of hypervolume than NSGA-II. However, the relative decrease in thes cases does not exceed -1.63%. Also, within this range, PO-count performs slightly better than other algorithms. These results demonstrate that the proposed approach improves the performance of genetic algorithms, especially in the case of many-objective optimization. It also suggests that the choice of the measure Âµ has a large impact on the performance. The latter relationship will be studied in future work. </p><h2>publication_ref</h2> <p>['b37', 'b9', 'b45', 'b41', 'b21'] </p><h2>figure_ref</h2> <p>['fig_5'] </p><h2>table_ref</h2> <p>[] </p><h2>heading</h2> <p>Conclusion </p><h2>text</h2> <p>In this paper, we formulate the problem of generalized topological sorting with choice maximization, which, to the best of our knowledge, was not considered in the literature before. We also prove that the at least k-Pareto optimal sets provide unique solutions. Further theoretical analysis of this problem leads us to an interesting relationship between the diversity of random points and the arc of hyperbola. Additionally, we propose a computationally efficient algorithm for the calculation of k-Pareto optimality for probability measures. Finally, we demonstrate a successful application of the developed theory. We show that sorting by k-Pareto optimality can drastically improve the performance of many-objective genetic optimization algorithms. In our experiments, the proposed solution based on the probability measure allows increasing the value of hypervolume by up to 60% for 25 objectives. This result can be considered as a potential solution to the problem of searchability deterioration in Paretodominance optimization.\nWe also believe that the proposed general framework can be used in different applications. In future work, we plan to study the applicability of k-Pareto optimality for constrained optimization, scheduling problems, recommender systems, and the development of statistical indicators. Maximization of choice might be also useful when studying causality and fairness. </p><h2>publication_ref</h2> <p>[] </p><h2>figure_ref</h2> <p>[] </p><h2>table_ref</h2> <p>[] </p><h2>heading</h2> <p>A.2 Cone-based Relations </p><h2>text</h2> <p>Let us again consider the unit square, the Lebesgue measure, and a positive constant a. However, this time the preference relation is defined as follows: yR a x iff y 2 â¤ x 2 and x 2 -y 2 â¥ a(y 1 -x 1 ). The above relation R a is an example of a cone-based relation illustrated in Fig. 9. This relation has the intuitive meaning of giving up (x 1 , x 2 ) for getting (y 1 , y 2 ) if the improvement (diminution) in the second characteristic is at least a times the trade-off (increase) in the first characteristic. In this case, selections are sets delimited by descending curves Let us now consider the sets of at least k-Pareto optimal elements of measure 0.25 for the three values of a: a = 1 10 , a = 1 2 , and a = 2, see Fig. 8b. Larger values of a represent higher maximum accepted trade-offs. This is represented by the gradual degeneration of the hyperbola into a straight horizontal line when a increases. As shown in the figure, the three sets demonstrate plausible behavior. In the situation discussed in Appendix A.1, the relation R corresponds to the extreme case of the relation R a with a = 0.\nx 2 = f (x 1 ) such that -1 a â¤ df dx1 â¤ 0. </p><h2>publication_ref</h2> <p>[] </p><h2>figure_ref</h2> <p>['fig_6'] </p><h2>table_ref</h2> <p>[] </p><h2>heading</h2> <p>A.3 Transitive relations </p><h2>text</h2> <p>In general, it is possible to show that if R * is transitive, then for any k, the set T k is a selection. In particular, if R is a partial order relation, Âµ is strictly positive, and X is countable, we obtain a linear extension [Dantzig, 1957] of R when sorting X by increasing values of po and sorting ties in any order. Selections are represented by downsets. The latter are obtained when topologically sorting X and taking the first n elements, for any n. If Âµ is the counting measure, then po(x) is simply the number of elements that can be reached by following downwards the edges of the corresponding Hasse diagram. An example of such a relation represented by its Hasse diagram is depicted in Fig. 10.\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>PO-COUNT<|>CONCEPT<|>PO-count is a measure used in optimization that yields a population covering the same hypervolume as NSGA-II, indicating its performance in genetic algorithms.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>NSGA-II<|>CONCEPT<|>NSGA-II is a well-known algorithm used for multi-objective optimization, serving as a benchmark for comparing the performance of other optimization methods.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PO-PROB<|>CONCEPT<|>PO-prob is an improved measure in optimization that enhances hypervolume performance compared to NSGA-II, particularly effective in many-objective optimization scenarios.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>K-PARETO OPTIMALITY<|>CONCEPT<|>k-Pareto optimality is a concept in optimization that provides unique solutions for generalized topological sorting with choice maximization, which has not been previously considered in literature.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>HYPERVOLUME<|>CONCEPT<|>Hypervolume is a metric used to evaluate the performance of multi-objective optimization algorithms, indicating the volume of the objective space covered by the solutions.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GENETIC ALGORITHMS<|>CONCEPT<|>Genetic algorithms are search heuristics that mimic the process of natural selection to generate high-quality solutions for optimization and search problems.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>COMPUTATIONAL EFFICIENCY<|>CONCEPT<|>Computational efficiency refers to the effectiveness of an algorithm in terms of time and resource usage, particularly in the context of calculating k-Pareto optimality.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MANY-OBJECTIVE OPTIMIZATION<|>CONCEPT<|>Many-objective optimization involves optimizing problems with more than three objectives, which presents unique challenges compared to traditional multi-objective optimization.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>FAIRNESS<|>CONCEPT<|>Fairness in optimization refers to the equitable treatment of different objectives or solutions, which can be a consideration in many optimization problems.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CAUSALITY<|>CONCEPT<|>Causality in optimization studies the cause-and-effect relationships between variables, which can influence the design and outcomes of optimization algorithms.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PO-COUNT<|>NSGA-II<|>PO-count yields a population covering the same hypervolume as NSGA-II, indicating a direct comparison in performance metrics<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PO-PROB<|>NSGA-II<|>PO-prob improves hypervolume performance compared to NSGA-II, showing a clear relationship in optimization effectiveness<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>K-PARETO OPTIMALITY<|>GENETIC ALGORITHMS<|>The proposed k-Pareto optimality approach enhances the performance of genetic algorithms, indicating a strong relationship<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>HYPERVOLUME<|>PO-PROB<|>Hypervolume is a key metric that PO-prob aims to improve, establishing a direct relationship between the two concepts<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MANY-OBJECTIVE OPTIMIZATION<|>GENETIC ALGORITHMS<|>Genetic algorithms are often applied to many-objective optimization problems, linking the two concepts<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>COMPUTATIONAL EFFICIENCY<|>K-PARETO OPTIMALITY<|>The development of a computationally efficient algorithm for k-Pareto optimality indicates a relationship focused on performance<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>FAIRNESS<|>CAUSALITY<|>Fairness can be studied in the context of causality, suggesting a relationship in optimization considerations<|>5)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
