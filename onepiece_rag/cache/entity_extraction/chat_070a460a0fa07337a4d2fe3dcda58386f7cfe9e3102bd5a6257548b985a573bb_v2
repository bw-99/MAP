The continuous curvature 𝑐 of the predefined hyperbolic space is learnable and differentiable. For simplicity, we denote the learnable parameters of our model 𝜅HGCN as 𝜃 . Let us consider node classification as an example. If the groundtruth label of node x is y and the predicted label is ȳ, then we have ȳ = 𝜅HGCN(x, 𝜅, 𝜃, 𝑐) and the loss is given by 𝐿(y, ȳ). We can take the derivative of 𝑐 with respect to the loss, i.e., 𝜕𝐿 (y,ȳ) 𝜕𝑐 = 𝜕 (y,𝜅HGCN(x,𝜅,𝜃,𝑐 ) ) 𝜕𝑐\n. It is easy to see that the update of 𝑐 is constrained by 𝜅. In other words, we learn a good embedding space equipped with curvature 𝑐 that matches the graph structure through discrete Ricci curvature 𝜅. </p><h2>publication_ref</h2> <p>[] </p><h2>figure_ref</h2> <p>[] </p><h2>table_ref</h2> <p>[] </p><h1>references</h1><h2>ref_id</h2> <p>b0 </p><h2>title</h2> <p>Metric tree-like structures in realworld networks: an empirical study </p><h2>journal</h2> <p>Networks </p><h2>year</h2> <p>2016 </p><h2>authors</h2> <p>Muad Abu; -Ata ; Feodor F Dragan </p><h2>ref_id</h2> <p>b1 </p><h2>title</h2> <p>Ricci curvature and the manifold learning problem </p><h2>journal</h2> <p>Advances in Mathematics </p><h2>year</h2> <p>2019 </p><h2>authors</h2> <p>G Antonio; Micah W Ache;  Warren </p><h2>ref_id</h2> <p>b2 </p><h2>title</h2> <p>Tree-like structure in large social and information networks </p><h2>journal</h2> <p>IEEE </p><h2>year</h2> <p>2013 </p><h2>authors</h2> <p>Blair D Aaron B Adcock; Michael W Sullivan;  Mahoney </p><h2>ref_id</h2> <p>b3 </p><h2>title</h2> <p>A theorem of Myers </p><h2>journal</h2> <p>Duke Mathematical Journal </p><h2>year</h2> <p>1957 </p><h2>authors</h2> <p> Ambrose </p><h2>ref_id</h2> <p>b4 </p><h2>title</h2> <p>Hyperbolic Image Segmentation </p><h2>journal</h2> <p> </p><h2>year</h2> <p>2022 </p><h2>authors</h2> <p>Mina Ghadimi; Atigh ; Julian Schoep; Erman Acar; Nanne Van Noord; Pascal Mettes </p><h2>ref_id</h2> <p>b5 </p><h2>title</h2> <p>Constant curvature graph convolutional networks </p><h2>journal</h2> <p>PMLR </p><h2>year</h2> <p>2020 </p><h2>authors</h2> <p>Gregor Bachmann; Gary Bécigneul; Octavian Ganea </p><h2>ref_id</h2> <p>b6 </p><h2>title</h2> <p>HGWaveNet: A Hyperbolic Graph Neural Network for Temporal Link Prediction </p><h2>journal</h2> <p> </p><h2>year</h2> <p>2023 </p><h2>authors</h2> <p>Qijie Bai; Changli Nie; Haiwei Zhang; Dongming Zhao; Xiaojie Yuan </p><h2>ref_id</h2> <p>b7 </p><h2>title</h2> <p>Modeling heterogeneous hierarchies with relation-specific hyperbolic cones </p><h2>journal</h2> <p>Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems </p><h2>year</h2> <p>2021 </p><h2>authors</h2\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}}
