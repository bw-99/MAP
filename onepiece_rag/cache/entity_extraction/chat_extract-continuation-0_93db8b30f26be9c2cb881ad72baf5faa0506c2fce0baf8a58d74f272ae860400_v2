The inputs include an N × N explicit trust matrix and an N × M rating matrix, denoted in what follows by T e and R, respectively. N and M denote the numbers of the users and of the items, respectively. In contrast with a standard CF algorithm, iTrace leverages much more information except user similarity for prediction of user rating. Such additional information is represented by a trust matrix, denoted by T in what follows, which is estimated by an implicit trust inference module that takes T e as input. The details on the implicit trust inference module are presented in Sec.2.2. A working flow of the iTrace algorithm for predicting user u's rating value on item i is summarized as follows.\n1. Calculate the similarity metrics between u and the other users who rated i using Eqn.(2).\n2. Select the top K users who are most similar to u as u's voting users.\n3. Estimate the trust of u on every voting user, using the implicit trust inference method presented in Sec. 2.2.\n4. Predict user u's rating value on item i as follows\nr u,i = ru + v∈U f (sim(u, v), t(u, v))(r v,i -rv ) v∈U |f (sim(u, v), t(u, v))| ,(3)\nwhere t(u, v) is the estimated trust of u on v, obtained from Step 3. The function f plays a role of integrating user similarity and trust in rating prediction.\nWe consider two different forms of the function f in our algorithm. The first one, termed incremental weighting (IW) here, is specified as follows\nf (sim(u, v), t(u, v)) = sim(u, v) t(u, v) j∈U sim(u, j) t(u, j) .(4)\nThe standard CF framework corresponds to a special case in which t(u, i) = t(u, j) for ∀i, j ∈ U . The other form of f under consideration, termed linear weighting (LW) here, is\nf (sim(u, v), t(u, v)) = αsim(u, v) j∈U sim(u, j) + (1 -α) t(u, v) j∈U t(u, j) ,(5)\nwhere 0 ≤ α ≤ 1 denotes the linear weighting coefficient. The standard CF algorithm then corresponds to the case in which α = 1. Through the analysis on Eqns.( 4) and ( 5), we see that the standard CF framework totally neglects the impact of the user trust. We show that in this paper, by taking into account of user trust, the iTrace algorithm can provide more accurate recommendations compared with the standard CF method. Through evaluation on a public dataset, we also demonstrate that Eqn.( 4) is preferable to Eqn. (5) in Sec.3.\nThe design of the implicit trust inference procedure, which is involved at Step 3 as shown above, creates a difference between the proposed iTrace algorithm and the other existing TaCF methods. The connections to related work in the literature are presented in Sec.2.3. We describe in detail the implicit trust inference procedure in the next subsection. </p><h2>publication_ref</h2> <p>['b4'] </p><h2>figure_ref</h2> <p>['fig_0'] </p><h2>table_ref</h2> <p>[] </p><h2>heading</h2> <p>Implicit Trust Inference </p><h2>text</h2> <p>This module takes as input an N × N sparse explicit trust matrix T e , and exploits trust propagation in order to predict, Fig. 2: 4 typical example cases under consideration for predicting user u's trust on user v.
