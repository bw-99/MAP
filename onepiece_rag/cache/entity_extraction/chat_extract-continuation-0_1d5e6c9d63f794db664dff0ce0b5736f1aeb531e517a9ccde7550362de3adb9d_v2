ORC seeks the most efficient transportation plan that preserves mass between two probability measures, which may be solved using linear programming. Intuitively, transporting messages between two nodes whose neighbors are highly overlapping, such as two nodes in the same cluster, is costless. On the other hand, if two nodes are situated in distinct groups or clusters, information flow between them is difficult. </p><h2>publication_ref</h2> <p>['b20', 'b57', 'b32', 'b57', 'b1', 'b75'] </p><h2>figure_ref</h2> <p>[] </p><h2>table_ref</h2> <p>[] </p><h2>heading</h2> <p>METHODOLOGY </p><h2>text</h2> <p>The proposed method, 𝜅HGCN, combines discrete and continuous curvatures to improve tree-like modeling in hyperbolic space.
