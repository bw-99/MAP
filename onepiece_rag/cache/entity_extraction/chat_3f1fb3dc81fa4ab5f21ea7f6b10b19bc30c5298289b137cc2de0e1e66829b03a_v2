The entropic regularization term, ϵ KL(π∥µ ⊗ ν), where ϵ is a positive regularization parameter and KL denotes the Kullback-Leibler divergence between π and the product distribution µ ⊗ ν, adds strong convexity to the optimization problem. This convexity ensures that the smoothness of the objective function allows for the application of gradient-based optimization methods that are known to converge quickly.    </p><h2>publication_ref</h2> <p>[] </p><h2>figure_ref</h2> <p>[] </p><h2>table_ref</h2> <p>[] </p><h2>heading</h2> <p>A.4 PRE-PROCESSING </p><h2>text</h2> <p>Cell Filtering Cells expressing fewer than θ g genes are excluded. Formally, cell i is removed if its gene count j 1 {Xij >0} is less than θ g , where X ij denotes the expression level of gene j in cell i, and 1 represents the indicator function.\nGene Filtering Similarly, genes expressed in fewer than θ c cells are discarded.

Postnormalization, logarithmic scaling is applied:\nX ′ ij = log(1 + X ij )\n, where X ij represents the normalized expression of gene j in cell i.\nIdentification of Highly Variable Genes Genes are deemed highly variable based on their mean expression µ j and dispersion σ 2 j , constrained within specified thresholds. A gene j qualifies as highly variable if it meets the criteria θ µ,min < µ j < θ µ,max and σ 2 j > θ σ . Scaling Subsequently, gene expression levels are standardized, ensuring zero mean and unit variance for each gene:\nX ′ ij = Xij -Xj σj\n, where X j and σ j denote the mean and standard deviation of gene j's expression, respectively.\nFinal Steps After the selection of highly variable genes, further scaling is applied:\nX ′′ ij = min(max(X ′ ij , -θ max ), θ max ).\nThis step ensures that the data range remains within the predefined limits, specified by θ max . </p><h2>publication_ref</h2> <p>[] </p><h2>figure_ref</h2> <p>[] </p><h2>table_ref</h2> <p>[] </p><h2>heading</h2> <p>A.5 PROJECTION TO REDUCED SUBSPACE </p><h2>text</h2> <p>In downstream analysis, Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is utilized to reduce the dimensionality of a gene expression matrix, X ′′ ∈ R N ×d , comprising N cells and d genes. This process involves the eigendecomposition of the covariance matrix Σ of pre-processed data X ′′ , to compute eigenvectors v i and their corresponding eigenvalues λ i , satisfying the equation Σv i = λ i v i . The top m eigenvectors, selected based on the magnitude of their eigenvalues, are represented as a matrix V m ∈ R d×m .
