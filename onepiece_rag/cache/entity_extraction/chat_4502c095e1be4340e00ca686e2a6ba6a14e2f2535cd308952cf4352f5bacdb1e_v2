For the embedding layer, we set the initial embedding size of all fields as 16 in accordance with the previous works [15,33]. For the MLP component, we adopt two fully-connected layers of size (16,8) with the ReLU activation function. We use Adam optimizer [13] with an initial learning rate of 0.001, and weight decay of 1e-6. The batch size is set to 2048. We sample one validation batch every 100 training batches for bi-level optimization.\nThe temperature 𝜏 for ST Gumbel-Softmax is set to 0.1. The baseline models are implemented by the codes provided by their authors. For a fair comparison, we set the initial embedding dimension as 16 for all baselines. All the experiments are run on a single machine with an Nvidia RTX 3090 GPU.  First, our iHAS outperforms all the state-of-the-art baseline methods as it can achieve higher AUC and lower Logloss on both datasets, demonstrating the effectiveness of iHAS in deep recommendation systems. Specifically, iHAS outperforms the runner-ups by 0.0038 (AUC) and 0.0021 (Logloss) on the Avazu datasets, and by 0.0004 (AUC) and 0.0006 (Logloss) on the Criteo datasets.\nSecondly, among all baselines, AdaFS-soft is the most effective model for the Avazu and Criteo datasets. However, it only shrinks the field features using a feature weighting layer and therefore does not completely eliminate the effect of unimportant fields. Although AdaFS-hard attempts to mask unimportant fields by uniformly keeping the top 𝐾 features, the trained feature weights may still exhibit a high variance pattern (remember the non-distinguishable probabilities in Figure 3, left panel). Therefore, this top 𝐾 selection manner may lead to selecting unimportant features or omitting the important feature in their final model, further compromising the model performance. Our polarization regularizer and threshold searcher can help with this issue, as detailed in Section 3.3.3 and evidenced by the empirical ablation study in Section 4.7.\nLastly, other baselines apply global feature/dimension selection across all samples, which fails to account for inherent variations among heterogeneous individuals, and consequently leads to suboptimal performance. Additionally, PEP mainly emphasizes on the model size, i.e., it stops searching once the embedding table reaches a predefined parameter size. This approach may result in a suboptimal embedding table due to overlooking the model performance. AutoFieldfoot_1 also employs the top 𝐾 selection manner, again leading to feature misselection and inferior model performance.<h2>publication_ref</h2>['b14', 'b32', 'b15', 'b7', 'b12']<h2>figure_ref</h2>['fig_2']<h2>table_ref</h2>[]<h2>heading</h2>Transferability Analysis (RQ2)<h2>text</h2>In this subsection, we explore the transferability of iHAS. Specifically, we freeze the parameters of the well-trained Bernoulli gates and utilize them to help train other popular deep recommendation models, including FM [26], W&D [4], and DeepFM [8].\nTable 3 shows the experimental results on Avazu, where \"original\" refers to the corresponding model without any selection. We can observe that: (i) all the recommendation models have great improvement by adopting iHAS, which again demonstrates the importance of performing selection in the recommendations; (ii) The transferability of iHAS is better than the best baseline (by comparing the iHAS and AdaFS-soft in Table 3), which validates the effectiveness of our Bernoulli gates.\nIn summary, we conclude that iHAS has outstanding transferability across different recommendation models, which enables it to be leveraged in complicated real-world recommender systems.<h2>publication_ref</h2>['\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}}
