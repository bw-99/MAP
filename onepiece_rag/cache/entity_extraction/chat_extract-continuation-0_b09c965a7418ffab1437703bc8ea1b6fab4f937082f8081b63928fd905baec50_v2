The modeling of stock ϒ in Γ takes N steps, corresponding to the trading cycles of τ 1 , • • • , τ N ,\nrespectively. Consider the ith trading cycle τ i , a sub-vector of actual stock returns is used as outcomes, denoted by y (i) = (y (i-1)D+2 , • • • , y (i-1)D+T +1 ). A sub-factor-matrix is used as the design matrix (predictors), denoted by X (i) = (x (i-1)D+1 , • • • , x (i-1)D+T ). We fit a sparse regression model:\ny (i) = w (i) X (i) + b (i) + ε (i) (1)\nSubject to the objective function:\nMinimize Lasso NLL = NLL + 1 2 λ [α||w (n) || 1 + (1 -α)||w (n) || 2 2 ]\n(2) where w (i) = (w\n(i) 1 , • • • , w (i) F ) denotes the weight vector of financial factors in the fitted model, b (i) is the bias, ε (i) is the error term, ||•|| 1 (|| • || 2 ) is L 1 (L 2\n) norm of the vector. D is set to 21 (average number of monthly trading days). The best weight vector is computed by minimizing the negative log likelihood (NLL) of a linear regression term plus L 1 and L 2 penalty terms of the weight vector. The penalty terms shrink the weight of unimportant factors to zero. On each trading cycle, the model is applied to predict daily stock returns.\nNote that λ and α in Eq. (2) control the degree of model sparsity and weights between L 1 and L 2 terms. In this work, we provide three choices of modeling: α = 1 (without the L 2 term), the famous Lasso model [Tib96] with a fixed λ ; LassoCV model using 10fold cross-validation to determine λ of the Lasso model The sparse regression model achieves feature selection (L 1 and L 2 penalty terms) and model optimization (regression term) simultaneously. This is extremely helpful to alleviate the overfitting effect in the factor investing case when the number of predictors (F = 56 in our implementation) is comparable to the number of training samples (T = 200). Though we apply a basic linear regression for stock prediction, the sparse models with L 1 and L 2 penalties can be easily extended to support more sophisticated models such as nonlinear models using customized kernel functions. </p><h2>publication_ref</h2> <p>[] </p><h2>figure_ref</h2> <p>[] </p><h2>table_ref</h2> <p>[] </p><h2>heading</h2> <p>Financial Factors </p><h2>text</h2> <p>For factor computation, we adopt the result of a latest white paper on the target stock market [Tsi18], which recommends six types of 56 factors with each factor characterizes a key aspect of a stock:\n• Transaction friction: 17 factors delineating overall status of a company (e.g., firm size by its market value, age of a firm) and transaction statistics (e.g., volatility, risks measured by stock returns compared with the market return); • Momentum: 5 factors computing daily stock returns in the recent 6/12 months, the change of momentum, and specially defined momentums; • Value: 8 factors including the famous book-to-market ratio proposed by Fama and French [FF92], the asset-to-market ratio, and other company performance related ratios; • Growth: 11 factors describing the growth of a company's asset, debt, market value, sales, profit, tax, etc; • Profitability: 8 factors quantifying return on equity, return on asset, and other factors related to company profits; • Liquidity: 7 factors characterizing the liquidity performance of a company, including current ratio, quick ratio, cash flow to debt ratio, etc.\nFor the above factors, the ranges of their values differ significantly from each other. Also, their values can change dramatically along with the stock market. Since all the factor values are normalized initially, the relative importance of each factor can be assessed, which can facilitate the factor analysis. The sparse regression model in iQUANT outputs three measures to delineate the importance of each factor in the prediction. Take the jth factor in the ith trading cycle (e.g., daily, monthly or quarterly) as an example, the three measures are as follows:\n• Factor weight learned in the model, denoted by w (i) j ;\n• Factor value changing in a daily basis, denoted by X (i) ; • Contribution of factors to the prediction of daily stock returns, denoted by\n∑ T +iD k=T +(i-1)D+1 w (i) j x k j .\nBy collecting the feedback from traders in our pilot study, we further extracted three metrics that are widely-used in industry to delineate the utilization of each factor. These two metrics are visualized in iQUANT to aid the interactive factor selection and stock portfolio construction process.\n• Sensitivity: a metric that indicates whether the utilization of a factor can be replaced by other factors. The sensitivity is computed by (ξ i jξ i ) +\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>SPARSE REGRESSION MODEL<|>CONCEPT<|>The sparse regression model is a statistical method used for predicting stock returns by minimizing the negative log likelihood while applying L1 and L2 penalties to the weight vector, thus achieving feature selection and model optimization simultaneously.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>FINANCIAL FACTORS<|>CONCEPT<|>Financial factors are key aspects of a stock that influence its performance, including transaction friction, momentum, value, growth, profitability, and liquidity.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LASSO MODEL<|>CONCEPT<|>The Lasso model is a type of regression analysis that performs both variable selection and regularization to enhance the prediction accuracy and interpretability of the statistical model.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LASSOCV MODEL<|>CONCEPT<|>The LassoCV model is an extension of the Lasso model that uses cross-validation to determine the optimal penalty parameter for the Lasso regression.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>TARGET STOCK MARKET<|>CONCEPT<|>The target stock market refers to the specific market being analyzed for stock performance, where various financial factors are computed to assess stock returns.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>TRANSACTION FRICTION<|>CONCEPT<|>Transaction friction includes factors that delineate the overall status of a company, such as firm size and transaction statistics like volatility and risks.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MOMENTUM<|>CONCEPT<|>Momentum refers to factors that compute daily stock returns over recent periods and assess changes in momentum.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>VALUE<|>CONCEPT<|>Value factors include financial ratios that assess a company's performance, such as the book-to-market ratio and asset-to-market ratio.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GROWTH<|>CONCEPT<|>Growth factors describe the increase in a company's assets, debt, market value, sales, profit, and tax.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PROFITABILITY<|>CONCEPT<|>Profitability factors quantify a company's financial performance, including return on equity and return on assets.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LIQUIDITY<|>CONCEPT<|>Liquidity factors characterize a company's ability to meet short-term obligations, including ratios like current ratio and quick ratio.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SPARSE REGRESSION MODEL<|>FINANCIAL FACTORS<|>The sparse regression model utilizes financial factors to predict stock returns effectively<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>LASSO MODEL<|>SPARSE REGRESSION MODEL<|>The Lasso model is a specific type of sparse regression model that incorporates L1 regularization<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>LASSOCV MODEL<|>LASSO MODEL<|>The LassoCV model is an extension of the Lasso model that uses cross-validation to optimize the penalty parameter<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>TRANSACTION FRICTION<|>FINANCIAL FACTORS<|>Transaction friction is one of the key financial factors that influence stock performance<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MOMENTUM<|>FINANCIAL FACTORS<|>Momentum is another key financial factor that affects stock returns<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>VALUE<|>FINANCIAL FACTORS<|>Value factors are part of the financial factors that assess a company's performance<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>GROWTH<|>FINANCIAL FACTORS<|>Growth factors are included in the financial factors that describe a company's asset and market value increase<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PROFITABILITY<|>FINANCIAL FACTORS<|>Profitability factors are essential financial factors that quantify a company's financial performance<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>LIQUIDITY<|>FINANCIAL FACTORS<|>Liquidity factors are critical financial factors that characterize a company's short-term financial health<|>5)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
