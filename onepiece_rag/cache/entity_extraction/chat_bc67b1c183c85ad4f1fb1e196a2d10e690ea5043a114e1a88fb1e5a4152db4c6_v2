In this case preferences can only be inferred by analyzing usage behavior. For example, we can easily record in a supermarket setting what items a customer purchases. However, we do not know why other products were not purchased. The reason might be one of the following.\n• The customer does not need the product right now.\n• The customer does not know about the product. Such a product is a good candidate for recommendation.\n• The customer does not like the product. Such a product should obviously not be recommended. Mild and Reutterer (2003) and Lee, Jun, Lee, and Kim (2005) present and evaluate recommender algorithms for this setting. The same reasoning is true for recommending pages of a web site given click-stream data. Here we only have information about which pages were viewed but not why some pages were not viewed. This situation leads to binary data or more exactly to 0-1 data where 1 means that we inferred that the user has a preference for an item and 0 means that either the user does not like the item or does not know about it. Pan, Zhou, Cao, Liu, Lukose, Scholz, and Yang (2008)  In the 0-1 case with r jk ∈ 0, 1 where we define:\nr jk = 1 user u j is known to have a preference for item i k 0 otherwise.(6)\nTwo strategies to deal with one-class data is to assume all missing ratings (zeros) are negative examples or to assume that all missing ratings are unknown. In addition, Pan et al. (2008) propose strategies which represent a trade-off between the two extreme strategies based on wighted low rank approximations of the rating matrix and on negative example sampling which might improve results across all recommender algorithms.\nIf we assume that users typically favor only a small fraction of the items and thus most items with no rating will be indeed negative examples. then we have no missing values and can use the approaches described above for real valued rating data. However, if we assume all zeroes are missing values, then this lead to the problem that we cannot compute similarities using Pearson correlation or Cosine similarity since the not missing parts of the vectors only contains ones. A similarity measure which only focuses on matching ones and thus prevents the problem with zeroes is the Jaccard index:\nsim Jaccard (X , Y) = |X ∩ Y| |X ∪ Y| , (7\n)\nwhere X and Y are the sets of the items with a 1 in user profiles u a and u b , respectively. The Jaccard index can be used between users for user-based filtering and between items for item-based filtering as described above.<h2>publication_ref</h2>['b30', 'b24', 'b32', 'b32']<h2>figure_ref</h2>[]<h2>table_ref</h2>[]<h2>heading</h2>Recommendations for 0-1 Data Based on Association Rules<h2>text</h2>Recommender systems using association rules produce recommendations based on a dependency model for items given by a set of association rules (Fu et al. 2000;Mobasher et al. 2001;Geyer-Schulz et al. 2002;Lin et al. 2002;Demiriz 2004). The binary profile matrix R is seen as a database where each user is treated as a transaction that contains the subset of items in I with a rating of 1. Hence transaction k is defined as T k = {i j ∈ I|r jk = 1} and the whole transaction data base is D = {T 1 , T 2 , . . . , T U } where U is the number of users. To build the dependency model, a set of association rules R is mined from R. Association rules are rules of the form X → Y where X , Y ⊆ I and X ∩ Y = ∅. For the model we only use association rules with a single item in the right-hand-side of the rule (|Y| = 1). To select a set of useful association rules, thresholds on measures of significance and interestingness are used. Two widely applied measures are:\nsupport(X → Y) = support(X ∪ Y) = Freq(X ∪ Y)/|D| = P (E X ∩ E Y ) confidence(X → Y) = support(X ∪ Y)/support(X ) = P (E Y |E X )\nFreq(I) gives the number of transactions in the data base D that contains all items in I. E I is the event that the itemset I is contained in a transaction.\nWe now require support(X → Y) > s and confidence(X → Y) > c and also include a length constraint |X ∪ Y| ≤ l. The set of rules R that satisfy these constraints form the dependency model. Although finding all association rules given thresholds on support and confidence is a hard problem (the model grows in the worse case exponential with the number of items), algorithms that efficiently find all rules in most cases are available (e.g., Agrawal and Srikant 1994;Zaki 2000;Han, Pei, Yin, and Mao 2004). Also model size can be controlled by l, s and c.\nTo make a recommendation for an active user u a given the set of items T a the user likes and the set of association rules R (dependency model), the following steps are necessary:\n1. Find all matching rules X → Y for which X ⊆ T a in R.\n2\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}}
