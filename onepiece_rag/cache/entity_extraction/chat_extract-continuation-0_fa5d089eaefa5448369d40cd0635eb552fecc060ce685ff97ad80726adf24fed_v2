RecSys Operation Mapping </p><h2>text</h2> <p>Given the iMARS architecture, careful mapping of the computation, how in Fig. 1 to iMARS is required in order to design the control sequence properly. The crossbars stored the trained weights of the DNN stack and the ItETs and UIETs store the trained ETs for the sparse feature vectors. Fig. 3 illustrates such a mapping where the labels (1a)-(2d*) indicates. We first discuss the operations in the filtering stage. (1a) The sparse features are sent to the corresponding ETs, i.e., UIETs and ItET for lookups and pooling. The embedding vectors of the features are obtained by looking up the stored ETs in the ItET CMAs and UIET CMAs using the RAM mode of the CMA. The retrieved embeddings are then aggregated (indicated by (1b*) in Fig. 3) by the in-memory adder, intramat and intra-bank adder trees. (1b) the dense features are sent to the pre-trained filtering sparse feature DNN stack which is implemented with the crossbar arrays. (1c) All features are then sent to the filtering DNN. The output of the filtering DNN is a user embedding vector (u i in Fig. 3). (1d) The user embedding vector is then sent to the ItET to retrieve the N nearest neighbors as candidate items inside the ItET CMAs. The indices of these retrieved (i.e., candidate) item embeddings are then stored in the item buffer (See (1d*) inf Fig. 3).\nWe now discuss the operations in the ranking stage. (2a) Each candidate item in the item buffer is then analyzed by the next steps with respect to the user's preferences. (2b) By using the item indices in the item buffer, their corresponding item embeddings are retrieved from the stored ET in the ItET and the ranking embeddings are retrieved in the stored ET in the ranking UIETs using the RAM mode. Note that some UIETs used in the filtering mode can be shared with the ranking stage. The item embeddings are pooled with the ranking embeddings either by concatenation or by an ADD operation using the in-memory adder, intra-bank and interbank adder trees. (See (2b*) in Fig. 3) The output forms a new set of embedding features. Together with the dense features are fed to the ranking DNN stack implemented in crossbars. (2c) the dense features are again obtained from the trained ranking DNN stack. (2d) The remaining crossbar arrays implement the ranking DNN with the pooled feature embeddings as input and return the click-through-rate (CTR) to the CTR buffer. The CTR buffer is a CMA that stores the CTR for each candidate item and the item index which are used for selecting the final top-k items. (2e) The CTR buffer then performs a topk operation using the threshold match mode of the CMA by searching a vector of all 1's (the maximum allowable CMA input). </p><h2>publication_ref</h2> <p>[] </p><h2>figure_ref</h2> <p>['fig_0', 'fig_2', 'fig_2', 'fig_2', 'fig_2', 'fig_2'] </p><h2>table_ref</h2> <p>[] </p><h2>heading</h2> <p>IV. EVALUATION </p><h2>text</h2> <p>We evaluated the RecSys implementations with two RecSys instances: (1) YoutubeDNN model [2] on the MovieLens 1M dataset, which includes both the filtering and ranking stage; (2) DLRM model [1] targeting at the ranking stage on the Criteo Kaggle dataset. The configurations of the two RecSys shown in Table I were implemented on Nvidia RTX 1080 GPU. We used the tools Nvidia-smi and lineprofiler to obtain energy and latency, respectively. We only compared with the GPU evaluation as other accelerators use older RecSys models and datasets.\nWe dimension B, M and C based on the largest dataset used in our evaluation (i.e., the Criteo Kaggle) with the configuration shown in Table . I. Each ET have different number of entries. In this configuration, the maximum size of the ETs in the Criteo Kaggle is 30,000 entries. Since each CMA has 256 rows, 118 CMAs are required to store the embedding table. The number of arrays is rounded up to the nearest power-oftwo value, i.e., 128. We choose C=32, which corresponds to 4 mats (M =4) working in parallel inside each bank, to have a balance between storing small and large ETs. The outputs from the 4 mats are accumulated at the bank level. Finally, the Criteo Kaggle dataset has 26 sparse features for ranking. Hence, we dimension iMARS with 32 banks (B=32) to accomodate all these features. The other features are also mapped accordingly,  with some mats and CMAs deactivated in a bank according to the size of the ET. We use 26 activated banks, 104 activated mats and 2860 activated CMAs for the Criteo Kaggle dataset.\nFor the MovieLens dataset (also used in our evaluation\n######################\noutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>IMARS<|>CONCEPT<|>iMARS is an architecture designed for efficient mapping of computations in recommender systems, particularly focusing on the control sequence and feature processing stages.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DNN STACK<|>CONCEPT<|>The DNN stack refers to a deep neural network architecture used for processing and filtering features in recommender systems, utilizing trained weights stored in crossbar arrays.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ETs<|>CONCEPT<|>ETs, or embedding tables, are structures that store trained embeddings for sparse feature vectors, facilitating lookups and pooling in the recommender system's operations.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CMA<|>CONCEPT<|>CMA stands for Content Management Architecture, which is used to manage and store embeddings and other data structures in the context of recommender systems.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CTR<|>CONCEPT<|>CTR, or click-through rate, is a metric used to evaluate the effectiveness of candidate items in recommender systems, indicating the likelihood of user engagement.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>YOUTUBEDNN<|>CONCEPT<|>YoutubeDNN is a model used in recommender systems, specifically evaluated on the MovieLens 1M dataset, encompassing both filtering and ranking stages.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DLRM<|>CONCEPT<|>DLRM, or Deep Learning Recommendation Model, is a model targeting the ranking stage in recommender systems, evaluated on the Criteo Kaggle dataset.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>IMARS<|>DNN STACK<|>iMARS utilizes a DNN stack for processing and filtering features, enhancing the performance of the recommender system.<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ETs<|>DNN STACK<|>The DNN stack interacts with ETs to retrieve and process embeddings for sparse features during the filtering stage.<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CMA<|>ETs<|>CMA is used to store and manage the ETs, facilitating efficient lookups and data handling in the recommender system.<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CTR<|>DLRM<|>DLRM evaluates the CTR to determine the effectiveness of candidate items in the ranking stage of the recommender system.<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>YOUTUBEDNN<|>IMARS<|>The iMARS architecture is evaluated using the YoutubeDNN model, demonstrating its application in real-world recommender systems.<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>DLRM<|>IMARS<|>The iMARS architecture is also evaluated with the DLRM model, showcasing its versatility in handling different recommender system configurations.<|>6)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
