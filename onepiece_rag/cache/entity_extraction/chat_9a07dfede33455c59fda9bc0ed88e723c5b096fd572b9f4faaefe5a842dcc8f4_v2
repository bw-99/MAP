Suppose that t 3 = D 3 = T 3 = 36.\nBy the transformation in Example 1, we know that α i = 1 and\nβ i = 1 for i = 1, 2.\nThere are two last release time orderings. Suppose that π 1 : {τ 1 , τ 2 } → {1, 2} and π 2 : {τ 1 , τ 2 } → {2, 1}. That is, the last release time ordering is τ 1 , τ 2 in π 1 , and the last release time ordering is τ 2 , τ 1 in π 2 . Now, we can use Lemma 1 based on π 1 and π 2 : 3 To demonstrate the impact of the last release time ordering, we use the original task indexes before applying π 1 or π 2 whenever referring to Example 4.\n• For π 1 , the schedulability condition in Lemma 1 shows that task τ 3 in Example 4 can meet the deadline if\nC 3 ≤ t 3 • (1 -U 1 -U 2 ) -(C 1 -U 1 (C 1 + C 2 ) + C 2 -U 2 C 2 ) = 0.3t 3 -2.8 = 8. • For π 2 , the schedulability condition in Lemma 1 shows that task τ 3 in Example 4 can meet the deadline if C 3 ≤ t 3 • (1 -U 2 -U 1 ) -(C 2 -U 2 (C 2 + C 1 ) + C 1 -U 1 C 1 ) = 0.3t 3 -2.6 = 8.2.\nThe immediate question is whether both C 3 ≤ 8 based on π 1 and C 3 ≤ 8.2 based on π 2 are safe. When t k = 36, the transformation in Example 1 in fact adopts the last release time ordering π 1 . Therefore, Lemma 1 is only safe under π 1 in this example. As a result, the test in Lemma 1 for the above example is only valid when we apply π 1 .\nHowever, in practice, we usually do not know how these tasks are indexed according to the required last release in the window of interest. It may seem at first glance that we need to test all the possible orderings. Fortunately, with the following lemma, we can safely consider only one specific last release time ordering of the k -1 higher-priority tasks.\nLemma 2. The worst-case ordering π of the k -1 higherpriority tasks under the schedulability condition in Eq. ( 5) in Lemma 1 is to order the tasks in a non-increasing order of βiCi αiUi , in which 0 < α i and 0 < β i for any i = 1, 2, . . . , k -1, 0 < t k .\nProof: This lemma is proved by showing that the schedulability condition in Lemma 1, i.e., 1 -\nk-1 i=1 α i U i - k-1 i=1 βiCi t k + αiUi( k-1 =i β C ) t k\n, is minimized, when the k -1 higher-priority tasks are indexed in a non-increasing order of βiCi αiUi . Suppose that there are two adjacent tasks τ h and τ h+1 with\nβ h C h α h U h < β h+1 C h+1 α h+1 U h+1 . Let us now examine the difference of k-1 i=1 αiUi( k-1 =i β C ) t k\nby swapping the index of task τ h and task τ h+1 .\nIt can be easily observed that the other tasks τ i with i = h and i = h + 1 do not change their corresponding values α i U i ( k-1 =i β C ) in both orderings (before and after swapping τ h and τ h+1 ). The difference in the term\nα h U h ( k-1 =h β C )+α h+1 U h+1 ( k-1 =h β C\n) before and after swapping tasks τ and τ +1 (before -after) is\n((α h U h β h+1 C h+1 -α h+1 U h+1 β h C h ) =α h α h+1 U h U h+1 β h+1 C h+1 α h+1 U h+1 - β h C h α h U h > 0.\nTherefore, we reach the conclusion that swapping τ h and τ h+1 in the ordering makes the schedulabilty condition more stringent. By applying the above swapping repetitively, we reach the conclusion that ordering the tasks in a non-increasing order of βiCi αiUi has the most stringent schedulability condition in Eq. ( 5).\nWe again use the configuration in Example 4 to demonstrate the rationale behind Lemma 2. In this example, let us consider that t 3 = T 3 = 23. When t k = 23, the transformation in Example 1 in fact adopts the last release time ordering π 2 , i.e., τ 3 is schedulable if C 3 ≤ 0.3t 3 -2.6 = 4.3.
