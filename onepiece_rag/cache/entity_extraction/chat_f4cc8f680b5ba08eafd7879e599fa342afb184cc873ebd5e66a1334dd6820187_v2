The prediction contains NA for the items rated by the active users. In the example we show the predicted ratings for the first 10 items for the two active users.\nAlternatively, we can also request the complete rating matrix which includes the original ratings by the user.\nR> recom <-predict (r, Jester5k[1001(r, Jester5k[ :1002]], type=\"ratingMatrix\") R> recom 2 x 100 rating matrix of class ???realRatingMatrix??? with 200 ratings.

Evaluation starts with creating an evaluation scheme that determines what and how data is used for training and testing. Here we create an evaluation scheme which splits the first 1000 users in Jester5k into a training set (90%) and a test set (10%). For the test set 15 items will be given to the recommender algorithm and the other items will be held out for computing the error.\nR> e <-evaluationScheme(Jester5k[1:1000], method=\"split\", train=0.9, + given=15, goodRating=5) R> e Evaluation scheme with 15 items given Method: ???split??? with 1 run(s). Training set proportion: 0.900 Good ratings: >=5.000000 Data set: 1000 x 100 rating matrix of class ???realRatingMatrix??? with 74164 ratings.\nWe create two recommenders (user-based and item-based collaborative filtering) using the training data. R> r1 <-Recommender(getData(e, \"train\"), \"UBCF\") R> r1\nRecommender of type ???UBCF??? for ???realRatingMatrix??? learned using 900 users. R> r2 <-Recommender(getData(e, \"train\"), \"IBCF\") R> r2\nRecommender of type ???IBCF??? for ???realRatingMatrix??? learned using 900 users.\nNext, we compute predicted ratings for the known part of the test data (15 items for each user) using the two algorithms.\nR> p1 <-predict(r1, getData(e, \"known\"), type=\"ratings\") R> p1 100 x 100 rating matrix of class ???realRatingMatrix??? with 8357 ratings. R> p2 <-predict(r2, getData(e, \"known\"), type=\"ratings\") R> p2 100 x 100 rating matrix of class ???realRatingMatrix??? with 8417 ratings.\nFinally, we can calculate the error between the prediction and the unknown part of the test data.\nR> error <-rbind( + UBCF = calcPredictionAccuracy(p1, getData(e, \"unknown\")), + IBCF = calcPredictionAccuracy(p2, getData(e, \"unknown\")) + ) R> error 4.571 20.89 3.585 IBCF 4.538 20.60 3.440 In this example user-based collaborative filtering produces a smaller prediction error.\nRMSE MSE MAE UBCF<h2>publication_ref</h2>[]<h2>figure_ref</h2>[]<h2>table_ref</h2>[]<h2>heading</h2>Evaluation of a top-N recommender algorithm<h2>text</h2>For this example we create a 4-fold cross validation scheme with the the Given-3 protocol, i.e., for the test users all but three randomly selected items are withheld for evaluation.\nR> scheme <-evaluationScheme(Jester5k[1:1000], method=\"cross\", k=4, given=3, + goodRating=5) R> scheme Evaluation scheme with 3 items given Method: ???\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}}
