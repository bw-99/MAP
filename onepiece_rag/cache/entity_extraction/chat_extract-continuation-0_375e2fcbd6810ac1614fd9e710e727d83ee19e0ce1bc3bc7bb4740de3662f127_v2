Hence, we dimension iMARS with 32 banks (B=32) to accomodate all these features. The other features are also mapped accordingly,  with some mats and CMAs deactivated in a bank according to the size of the ET. We use 26 activated banks, 104 activated mats and 2860 activated CMAs for the Criteo Kaggle dataset.\nFor the MovieLens dataset (also used in our evaluation), due to the much smaller number of rows per ET, we are still able to use the same architecture while keeping idle arrays deactivated. The MovieLens dataset uses 5 UIET for the filtering stage and 6 UIET for the ranking stage (Table I), 5 of which are shared between the filtering and ranking stages. ETs have a maximum of 6040 entries and a minimum of 3 entries. We use 7 active banks, 8 active mat and 54 active CMA in the MovieLens dataset. </p><h2>publication_ref</h2> <p>['b1', 'b0'] </p><h2>figure_ref</h2> <p>[] </p><h2>table_ref</h2> <p>['tab_0', 'tab_0'] </p><h2>heading</h2> <p>A.

In our evaluation, besides the memory cells inside each CMA, we also consider all the peripherals depicted in Fig. 3(c). The adder trees and communication network are implemented in Verilog and synthesized with Cadence Encounter RTL Compiler v14.10, with the NanGate 45nm open-cell library [21]. The crossbars are evaluated by the Neurosim tool [22] using a 45nm FeFET model. Table II summarizes the array-level figures-of-merit (FoM) for the different types of accesses supported by the CMA. Table II also includes the FoM for a 256×128 crossbar.

Energy and Latency Evaluation </p><h2>text</h2> <p>We estimated the energy and latency of iMARS based on the mapping and the simulated array-level FoM. As the latency and energy improvement of TCAM arrays and crossbars are well studied in previous work [5] [22], in this section we mainly focus on our findings on ET lookup operations, which is also a bottleneck of the RecSys. We compare the latency and energy of TCAM-based LSH search with the LSH search on GPU as well as the original cosine search on GPU. Finally we report the end-to-end system comparison.\n1) ET lookup operation: Table III shows the latency and energy consumption of the ET lookup operation in the two RecSys instances as well as on GPU. All the data are obtained for one item input. The ET lookup operation in iMARS includes the multiple lookups of CMAs, the intra-mat addition and intra-bank addition. To estimate the latency and energy on iMARS, we consider the worst case that all lookups for one ET happen in the same array. Multiple lookups in one array requires multiple read, write and in-memory add operations, incurring higher latency and energy. We also include the latency/energy overhead of communication due to wiring and serialization with the RSC bus/IBC network. Thus, under the aforesaid worst case, the iMARS takes 0.24 µs latency and 6.88 µJ energy for a single input on the Criteo Kaggle dataset and achieves 61.83× latency and 47.9× energy improvement. For the MovieLens dataset, the iMARS achieves 43.1×/45.6× speedup and 516.05×/458.12× energy reduction over the GPU counterpart on the filtering/ranking stages.\nFrom Table III, it can be seen that on both GPU and iMARS, the ranking stage takes more time and energy than the filtering stage for MovieLens because the ranking stage deploys one more ET than the filtering stage as the memory\n######################\noutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>KAGGLE DATASET<|>CONCEPT<|>The Kaggle dataset is a collection of data used for ranking tasks, featuring 26 sparse features that are processed using a specific architecture for machine learning applications.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>IMARS<|>CONCEPT<|>iMARS is a machine learning architecture designed to handle multiple features and optimize performance in ranking tasks, particularly in datasets like Criteo and MovieLens.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CRITEO DATASET<|>CONCEPT<|>The Criteo dataset is a large-scale dataset used for machine learning tasks, particularly in ranking and recommendation systems, featuring a significant number of entries and features.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MOVIELENS DATASET<|>CONCEPT<|>The MovieLens dataset is a collection of movie ratings and user preferences used for evaluating recommendation systems, characterized by a smaller number of rows compared to other datasets.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ET<|>CONCEPT<|>ET refers to the entry types used in the context of the datasets, which are essential for filtering and ranking stages in recommendation systems.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CMA<|>CONCEPT<|>CMA stands for Crossbar Memory Array, a component used in the architecture for storing and processing data in machine learning models.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>UIET<|>CONCEPT<|>UIET refers to User Item Entry Types, which are utilized in the filtering and ranking stages of the MovieLens dataset.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LATENCY<|>CONCEPT<|>Latency is a measure of the time delay in processing data, particularly in the context of machine learning operations and system performance.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ENERGY<|>CONCEPT<|>Energy refers to the amount of power consumed during data processing operations in machine learning systems, which is a critical factor in evaluating performance.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>KAGGLE DATASET<|>IMARS<|>iMARS is specifically designed to accommodate the features of the Kaggle dataset for ranking tasks, optimizing its performance.<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>IMARS<|>CRITEO DATASET<|>iMARS is applied to the Criteo dataset to enhance ranking and filtering processes, leveraging its architecture for better performance.<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>IMARS<|>MOVIELENS DATASET<|>iMARS is also utilized for the MovieLens dataset, adapting its architecture to handle the unique characteristics of this dataset.<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ET<|>UIET<|>ETs are used in conjunction with UIETs during the filtering and ranking stages of the MovieLens dataset, indicating their interdependence.<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CMA<|>IMARS<|>CMAs are integral components of the iMARS architecture, facilitating data storage and processing in machine learning tasks.<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>LATENCY<|>ENERGY<|>Latency and energy consumption are both critical metrics evaluated in the performance of iMARS during its operations on datasets.<|>8)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
