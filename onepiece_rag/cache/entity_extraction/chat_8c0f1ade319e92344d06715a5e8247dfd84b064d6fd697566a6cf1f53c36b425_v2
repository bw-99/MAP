The choice α = 0.01 × mean(diag(Σ i )) is a heuristic wherein the covariance matrix is regularized by adding 1% of its average variance to its diagonal. This represents an arbitrary yet small perturbation. Benefits of covariance regularization include:\n• Invertibility: When the number of dimensions is close to or exceeds the number of data points, Σ might be singular. Regularization ensures its invertibility. • Stability: For ill-conditioned matrices, their inversion can be highly sensitive to slight changes in the data. Regularization stabilizes the inversion process. The condition number is a commonly used measure to gauge the stability of a matrix, especially when it comes to measuring how a matrix will amplify errors in problems involving matrix inversion.
