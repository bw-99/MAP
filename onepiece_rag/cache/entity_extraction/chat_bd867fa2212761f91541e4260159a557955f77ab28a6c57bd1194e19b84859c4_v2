The visual design is challenging, as the space for each stock is limited and there could be many factors relevant to a stock. On each factor, there are also multiple attributes to be visualized, e.g., the magnitude and polarity of importance (contribution), the model bias, and the trend of the stock price.\nIn our design, the visualization of each stock follows a similar layout to the display in the factor view. As shown in Figure 2(c), the x-axis is a timeline divided into units. At each time unit, a stock bar is drawn (the yellow bar of Figure 6 (d)), whose height represents the ratio of stock price change in this time unit and width represents the rate of prediction error on the price change by models. A red (green) bar indicates a rise (drop) of the stock price. On top of and below each stock bar, there are two factor glyphs which summarize the factors having a positive and negative contribution to the price change in the predictive model.\nThe factor glyph at the top and bottom in Figure 6 (d) has a circular shape, and is composed of one inner circle and six angular sectors in the outside. The radius of the inner circle encodes the model bias. Each outer sector represents one type of factors, with the size of each sector indicating the sum of all factor's importance in this type. On each factor glyph, the top-5 factors with the highest importance in all factor types are displayed. When more than one factor from the same type belongs to the top-5, a Voronoi diagram is drawn to pack these factors in the same angular sector. Each region in the Voronoi diagram corresponds to one factor, with the region size indicating its importance. The sum of all the other factor's importance out of the top-5 category is represented by the grey region close to the glyph center. When users hover a Voronoi region of one factor, a line will be drawn to connect all the Voronoi regions of this factor over time. Meanwhile, a tooltip showing the factor type, name and importance will also appear. When the factor does not belong to the top-5 category, the line will be linked to zero position on the x-axis.\nAlternative designs such as line chart and streamgraph [HHN00] are commonly used for visualizing temporal evolution of variables. In our scenario, the top-5 factors can be quite different in separate time units, making line charts or streamgraph discontinuous over time and hard to track by users. Commodity designs such as stacked bar charts and pie charts are also considered. Nevertheless, the stacked bar chart is not scalable to support dozens of factors in the same view. The pie chart can clearly show the percentage of each factor in importance, but again the relative position of the same factor can vary a lot in different units, making it hard to compare the evolution of the same factor. iQUANT is designed for financial factor selection, which makes it inevitable to consider much domain knowledge and incorporate different factors in our design. This can increase the design complexity and it takes some time for user to learn, but most of our users can be well prepared after a training session of about 10 minutes as indicated in Section 6.3, which we would argue is a reasonable learning effort. </p><h2>publication_ref</h2> <p>['b19'] </p><h2>figure_ref</h2> <p>['fig_2', 'fig_2', 'fig_7', 'fig_7'] </p><h2>table_ref</h2> <p>[] </p><h2>heading</h2> <p>Factor List </p><h2>text</h2> <p>Factor list (Figure 2(d)) aggregates factor data together to depict the overall factor performance (T2).
