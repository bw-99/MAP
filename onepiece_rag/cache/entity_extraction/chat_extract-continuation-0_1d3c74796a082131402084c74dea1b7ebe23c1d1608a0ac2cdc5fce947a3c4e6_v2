When testing the schedulability or analyzing the worst-case response time of task τ k , we do not need the priority ordering of the higher-priority tasks in hp(τ k ). But, we need to know how to order the k -1 higherpriority tasks so that we can formulate the test with simple and linear arithmetics based on the total order. For the rest of this paper, the ordering of the k -1 higher-priority tasks implicitly refers to their last release time ordering (except explanations regarding the last release time ordering when referring to Example 4). In the k 2 Q framework, we are only interested to test only k time points. More precisely, we are only interested to test whether task τ k can be successfully executed before the last release time of a higher-priority task in the testing window. Therefore, the last release time ordering provides a total order so that we can transform the schedulability tests into the following definition. Definition 2. A k-point last-release schedulability test under a given last release time ordering π of the k -1 higherpriority tasks is a sufficient schedulability test of a fixedpriority scheduling policy, that verifies the existence of t j with j = 1, 2, . . . , k such that\n0 ≤ t 1 ≤ t 2 ≤ • • • ≤ t k-1 ≤ t k and C k + k-1 i=1 α i t i U i + j-1 i=1 β i C i ≤ t j ,(2)\nwhere C k > 0, for i = 1, 2, . . . , k-1, α i > 0, U i > 0, C i ≥ 0, and β i > 0 are dependent upon the setting of the task models and task τ i .\nExample 1. Implicit-deadline task systems: For an implicitdeadline sporadic task system τ , suppose that we are interested to test whether task τ k can meet its deadline or not under a fixed-priority scheduling algorithm on a uniprocessor platform. Let |hp(τ k )| be k -1 and the tasks in hp(τ k ) be ordered by\n( T k Ti -1)T i non-decreasingly, i.e., t 1 ≤ t 2 ≤ • • • ≤ t k-1 ≤ t k = T k .\nFor a specific testing point at time t j for a certain j = 1, 2, . . . , k, the function tj Ti C i (to quantify the workload due to the jobs released by a higher-priority task τ i ∈ hp(τ k )) has two cases: 1) if i < j, due to the definition of t i as ( T k Ti -1)T i and t i ≤ t j ≤ T k , we know that tj Ti C i is upper bounded by\nti Ti C i + C i = t i U i + C i ; 2) if i ≥ j, due to the definition of t i as ( T k Ti -1)T i and t j ≤ t i ≤ T k , we know that tj Ti C i is upper bounded by ti Ti C i = t i U i . 2\nBy the above analysis, for a given j = 1, 2, . . . , k, we know that\nC k + k-1 i=1 tj Ti C i ≤ C k + k-1 i=1 t i U i + j-1 i=1 C i .\nTherefore, we know that task τ k is schedulable by the fixedpriority scheduling if there exists j ∈ {1, 2, . . . , k} such that\nC k + k-1 i=1 t i U i + j-1 i=1 C i ≤ t j .\nIn other words, by the specific index rule of the tasks in hp(τ k ) and setting α i = 1 and β i = 1 for every task τ i in hp(τ k ), we reach a concrete example for Definition 2.\nA concrete example is provided here for illustrating Example 1.\nExample 2. Consider that k = 3 and |hp(τ k )| is 2. For the two tasks in hp(τ k ), let C 1 = 2, U 1 = 0.2, T 1 = 10 and C 2 = 4, U 2 = 0.5, T 2 = 8. Suppose that t 3 = D 3 = T 3 = 36. By the transformation in Example 1, we know that t 1 = 30 and t 2 = 32. The last release time ordering π of {τ 1 , τ 2 } follows the index, i.e., π :\n{τ 1 , τ 2 } → {1, 2}. Moreover, α 1 = α 2 = β 1 = β 2 = 1.\nSimilar to Definition 2, we can also define an abstracted worst-case response time analysis as follows: Definition 3. A k-point last-release response time analysis is a safe response time analysis of a fixed-priority scheduling policy under a given last release time ordering π of the k -1 higher-priority tasks by finding the maximum\nt k = C k + k-1 i=1 α i t i U i + k-1 i=1 β i C i ,(3)\nwith 0 ≤ t 1 ≤ t 2 ≤ • • • ≤ t k-1 ≤ t k and C k + k-1 i=1\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>K-POINT LAST-RELEASE SCHEDULABILITY TEST<|>EVENT<|>A k-point last-release schedulability test is a sufficient schedulability test of a fixed-priority scheduling policy that verifies the existence of time points for task execution.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>TASK τ K<|>PERSON<|>Task τ k is a specific task in a scheduling framework that is being analyzed for its ability to meet deadlines under fixed-priority scheduling.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>FIXED-PRIORITY SCHEDULING<|>EVENT<|>Fixed-priority scheduling is a scheduling policy where tasks are assigned priorities and executed based on those priorities.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>HIGHER-PRIORITY TASKS<|>PERSON<|>Higher-priority tasks are tasks that have a higher priority than task τ k and influence its scheduling and execution.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>WORKLOAD<|>EVENT<|>Workload refers to the amount of work or tasks that need to be processed by the system, particularly from higher-priority tasks.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SCHEDULABILITY TEST<|>EVENT<|>A schedulability test is an analysis performed to determine if a task can meet its deadlines under a given scheduling policy.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>TASK τ K<|>FIXED-PRIORITY SCHEDULING<|>Task τ k is analyzed under the fixed-priority scheduling policy to determine its schedulability<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>K-POINT LAST-RELEASE SCHEDULABILITY TEST<|>FIXED-PRIORITY SCHEDULING<|>The k-point last-release schedulability test is a specific type of analysis used within fixed-priority scheduling<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>HIGHER-PRIORITY TASKS<|>TASK τ K<|>Higher-priority tasks affect the scheduling and execution of task τ k in the fixed-priority scheduling framework<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>WORKLOAD<|>HIGHER-PRIORITY TASKS<|>The workload is influenced by the jobs released by higher-priority tasks in the scheduling system<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SCHEDULABILITY TEST<|>K-POINT LAST-RELEASE SCHEDULABILITY TEST<|>The k-point last-release schedulability test is a specific type of schedulability test<|>6)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
