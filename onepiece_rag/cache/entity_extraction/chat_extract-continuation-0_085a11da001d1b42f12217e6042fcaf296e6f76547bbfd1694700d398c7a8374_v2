SYSTEM MODEL G on </p><h2>text</h2> <p>Consider a vertex set V = v 1 , v 2 , . . . , v n . Each node v i ∈ V is assigned a key ring S i that consists of K n distinct keys selected uniformly at random from a key pool P of size P n . The random key graph G(n, K n , P n ) is defined on the vertex set V such that two distinct nodes v i and v j are adjacent, denoted K ij , if their key rings have at least one key in common; i.e.,\nK ij = [S i ∩ S j = ∅].\nFor distinct nodes v x and v y , we let S xy denote the intersection of their key rings S x and S y ; i.e., S xy = S x ∩ S y .\nOur main interest is to study random key graphs whose links are unreliable. In particular, we assume that each link is on with probability p n , or off with probability 1p n , independently from any other link. Namely, with C ij denoting the event that link between v i and v j is on, C ij , 1 ≤ i < j ≤ n are mutually independent such that\nP [C ij ] = p n , 1 ≤ i < j ≤ n.(1)\nThis unreliable link model can be represented [11] by an Erdős-Rényi (ER) graph G(n, p n ) on the vertices V such that there exists an edge between nodes v i and v j if the link between them is on; i.e., if the event C ij takes place.\nFinally, the graph G on (n, K n , P n , p n ) is defined on the vertices V such that two distinct nodes v i and v j have an edge in between, denoted E ij , if the events K ij and C ij take place at the same time. In other words, we have\nE ij = K ij ∩ C ij , 1 ≤ i < j ≤ n(2)\nso that\nG on (n, K n , P n , p n ) = G(n, K n , P n ) ∩ G(n, p n ).(3)\nThroughout, we simplify the notation by writing G on instead of G on (n, K n , P n , p n ). Thus, our main model G on is an intersection of a random key graph and an ER graph. Throughout, we let p s (K n , P n ) be the probability that the key rings of two distinct nodes share at least one key and let p e (K n , P n , p n ) be the probability that there exists a link between two distinct nodes in G on . For simplicity, we write p s (K n , P n ) as p s and write p e (K n , P n , p n ) as p e . Then for any two distinct nodes v i and v j , we have\np s := P[K ij ].(4)\nIt is easy to derive p s in terms of K n and P n as shown in previous work [2], [32], [39]. In fact, we have\np s = P[S i ∩ S j = ∅] =    1 - ( Pn -Kn Kn ) ( Pn Kn ) , if P n ≥ 2K n , 1 if P n < 2K n .(5)\nGiven (2), the independence of the events C ij and K ij gives\np e := P[E ij ] = P[C ij ] • P[K ij ] = p n • p s(6)\nfrom ( 1) and (4). Substituting ( 5) into (6), we obtain\np e = p n • 1 - Pn-Kn Kn Pn Kn if P n ≥ 2K n .(7) </p><h2>publication_ref</h2> <p>['b10', 'b1', 'b31', 'b38', 'b1'] </p><h2>figure_ref</h2> <p>[] </p><h2>table_ref</h2> <p>[] </p><h2>heading</h2> <p>IV.
