ESTABLISHING (149)<h2>text</h2>We now proceed as follows: Given Kn Pn = o(1) and the definition of r n in (130), we necessarily have lim n→∞ r n = +∞, and for an given integer R ≥ 2, we have\nr n > R for any n ≥ n ⋆ (R)(163)\nfor some finite integer n ⋆ (R). We define f n,ℓ,r as follows.\nf n,ℓ,r = n ℓ n -ℓ r P A ℓ,r ∩ E(J ) .\nThen, we have\nL.H.S. of (149) = ⌊ n-ℓ 2 ⌋ r=2 f n,ℓ,r .(164)\nFor the time being, pick an arbitrarily large integer R ≥ 2 (to be specified in Section XIII-B), and on the range n ≥ n ⋆ (R) consider the decomposition\n⌊ n-ℓ 2 ⌋ r=2 f n,ℓ,r = R r=2 f n,ℓ,r + rn r=R+1 f n,ℓ,r + ⌊ n-ℓ 2 ⌋ r=rn+1 f n,ℓ,r .\nLet n go to infinity: The desired convergence (149) (for Proposition 4) will be established if we show \nR r=2 f n,ℓ,r = o(1),(165)\nand\n⌊ n-ℓ 2 ⌋ r=rn+1 f n,ℓ,r = o(1).(167)\nThe next subsections are devoted to proving the validity of (165), (166) and (167) by repeated applications of Lemma 6.

For any arbitrary integer R ≥ 2, it is clear that (165) will follow upon showing\nlim n→∞ f n,ℓ,r = 0 if lim n→∞ β ℓ,n = +∞(169)\nfor each r = 2, 3, . . . , R. On that range, property (a) of Lemma 6 is valid since r ≤ ⌊ Pn-Kn 2Kn ⌋ for all n sufficiently large by virtue of the fact that Kn Pn = o(1).\nFrom the easily obtained bounds n ℓ ≤ n ℓ and n-ℓ r ≤ n r , we now get\nf n,ℓ,r ≤ n ℓ • n r • r r-2 p r-1 e (2rp e ) ℓ • e -pe(1+ε/2)(n-r-ℓ) = (2r) ℓ r r-2 • n ℓ+r p ℓ+r-1 e\n• e -pen(1+ε/2) • e pe(1+ε/2)(r+ℓ) .\n( • e -(ln n+ℓ ln ln\nn+β ℓ,n )(1+ε/2) • e o(1) = n • (ln n) ℓ+r-1 • n -1 (ln n) -ℓ e -β ℓ,n 1+ε/2 = n -ε/2 (ln n) r-ℓε/2-1 e -β ℓ,n (1+ε/2) = o(1)\nby virtue of the facts that r is bounded and lim n→∞ β ℓ,n = +∞.
