AUC refers to the area under the ROC curve, which means the probability that a model will rank a randomly selected positive instance higher than a randomly selected negative one. A higher AUC value indicates superior model performance. On the other hand, Logloss, aka binary cross-entropy loss, directly quantifies the model's performance, with a lower score denoting more accurate predictions. Note that a marginal 0.001-level improvement in AUC (increase) or Logloss (decrease) is perceived as a significant enhancement in model performance [19,33,37]. </p><h2>publication_ref</h2> <p>['b16', 'b24', 'b18', 'b32', 'b36'] </p><h2>figure_ref</h2> <p>[] </p><h2>table_ref</h2> <p>[] </p><h2>heading</h2> <p>Baseline Methods </p><h2>text</h2> <p>We compare our proposed method with the following state-of-theart methods:\n‚Ä¢ PEP [17]: It adopts trainable thresholds to prune redundant embedding dimensions. ‚Ä¢ AutoField [33]: It utilizes neural architecture search techniques [16] to select important field features. ‚Ä¢ OptEmbed [20]: It trains a supernet with various selected embedding dimensions, then uses evolution search to find the optimal embedding dimensions based on the supernet. ‚Ä¢ AdaFS [15]: It assigns weights to different fields in a soft manner (AdaFS-soft) or masks unimportant fields in a hard manner (AdaFS-hard) via a novel controller network. ‚Ä¢ OptFS [19]: It simultaneously selects optimal field features and the optimal interactions between these features using \"binary gates\". </p><h2>publication_ref</h2> <p>['b16', 'b32', 'b15', 'b19', 'b14', 'b18'] </p><h2>figure_ref</h2> <p>[] </p><h2>table_ref</h2> <p>[] </p><h2>heading</h2> <p>Implementation Details </p><h2>text</h2> <p>We implement our method based on a public libraryfoot_0 that involves sixteen commonly-used DLRMs. As our framework is modelagnostic, it can be seamlessly integrated with any of these models, see Section 4.6. For the embedding layer, we set the initial embedding size of all fields as 16 in accordance with the previous works [15,33]. For the MLP component, we adopt two fully-connected layers of size (16,8) with the ReLU activation function. We use Adam optimizer [13] with an initial learning rate of 0.001, and weight decay of 1e-6. The batch size is set to 2048. We sample one validation batch every 100 training batches for bi-level optimization.\nThe temperature ùúè for ST Gumbel-Softmax is set to 0.1. The baseline models are implemented by the codes provided by their authors. For a fair comparison, we set the initial embedding dimension as 16 for all baselines. All the experiments are run on a single machine with an Nvidia RTX 3090 GPU.  First, our iHAS outperforms all the state-of-the-art baseline methods as it can achieve higher AUC and lower Logloss on both datasets, demonstrating the effectiveness of iHAS in deep recommendation systems. Specifically, iHAS outperforms the runner-ups by 0.0038 (AUC) and 0.0021 (Logloss) on the Avazu datasets, and by 0.0004 (AUC) and 0.0006 (Logloss) on the Criteo datasets.\nSecondly, among all baselines, AdaFS-soft is the most effective model for the Avazu and Criteo datasets. However, it only shrinks the field features using a feature weighting layer and therefore does not completely eliminate the effect of unimportant fields. Although AdaFS-hard attempts to mask unimportant fields by uniformly keeping the top ùêæ features, the trained feature weights may still exhibit a high variance pattern (remember the non-distinguishable probabilities in Figure 3, left panel). Therefore, this top ùêæ selection manner may lead to selecting unimportant features or omitting the important feature in their final model, further compromising the model performance. Our polarization regularizer and threshold searcher can help with this issue, as detailed in Section 3.3.3 and evidenced by the empirical ablation study in Section 4.7.\nLastly, other baselines apply global feature/dimension selection across all samples, which fails to account for inherent variations among heterogeneous individuals, and consequently leads to suboptimal performance. Additionally, PEP mainly emphasizes on the model size, i.e., it stops searching once the embedding table reaches a predefined parameter size.
