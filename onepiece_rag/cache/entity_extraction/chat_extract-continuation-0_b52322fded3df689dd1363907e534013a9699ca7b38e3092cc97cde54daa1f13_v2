The standard CF algorithm then corresponds to the case in which α = 1. Through the analysis on Eqns.( 4) and ( 5), we see that the standard CF framework totally neglects the impact of the user trust. We show that in this paper, by taking into account of user trust, the iTrace algorithm can provide more accurate recommendations compared with the standard CF method. Through evaluation on a public dataset, we also demonstrate that Eqn.( 4) is preferable to Eqn. (5) in Sec.3.\nThe design of the implicit trust inference procedure, which is involved at Step 3 as shown above, creates a difference between the proposed iTrace algorithm and the other existing TaCF methods. The connections to related work in the literature are presented in Sec.2.3. We describe in detail the implicit trust inference procedure in the next subsection.<h2>publication_ref</h2>['b4']<h2>figure_ref</h2>['fig_0']<h2>table_ref</h2>[]<h2>heading</h2>Implicit Trust Inference<h2>text</h2>This module takes as input an N × N sparse explicit trust matrix T e , and exploits trust propagation in order to predict, Fig. 2: 4 typical example cases under consideration for predicting user u's trust on user v. A solid line with an arrow pointing from i to j is associated with the event that t e (i, j) takes value 1. A dotted line with an arrow pointing from i to j indicates a missing value of t e (i, j) and that there exists an implicit trust of i on j, which can be inferred from T e . The lightning symbol in the 4th sub-figure indicates a cut-off of the trust information flow.\nfor every user, how much she could trust every other user. In this way, it outputs an estimated trust matrix T , the (i, j)th cell t(i, j) (if present) of which represents how much the ith user trusts the jth user. The input matrix T e has a very limited number of cells that take value 1 and all the other cells are empty with missing values. If the (i, j)th cell of T e , denoted by t e (i, j), takes value 1, it means that user i has expressed a trust statement that she trusts user j. It is worth noting that, in practical applications, the available trust data, represented as matrix T e here, would always be very sparse. This is so because no user can reasonably interact with every other user and then issue a trust statement about them.<h2>publication_ref</h2>[]<h2>figure_ref</h2>[]<h2>table_ref</h2>[]<h2>heading</h2>Four categories of trust information flow patterns<h2>text</h2>We categorize the patterns of the trust information flow from user u to v into 4 complementary classes. For each class, we show a typical example in Fig. 2. The 1st sub-figure corresponds to the case in which t e (u, v) = 1. If t e (i, j) = 1, then j is called an explicit trustee of i. The 2nd sub-figure exemplifies the case in which v is not an explicit trustee of u but u and v have common explicit trustee(s). The 3rd sub-figure exemplifies the case in which v is not an explicit trustee of u, u and v have no common explicit trustee but there is at least one trust propagation path from u to v. A trust propagation path from i to j is defined by a series of user pairs {p m , p m+1 }, m = 1, . . . , M -1, M ∈ N, which satisfies p 1 = i, p M = j, and t(p m , p m+1 ) > 0, ∀m ∈ {1, . . . , M -1}. This model indicates that, if user i trusts another user k to some extent and user k trusts user j to some extent, then there will be a trust propagation path from i to j. Note that this model conforms to the transitivity property of the concept of trust [9,15,16]. The 4th sub-figure is associated with the case that there is no trust propagation path from u to v.<h2>publication_ref</h2>['b8', 'b14', 'b15']<h2>figure_ref</h2>[]<h2>table_ref</h2>[]<h2>heading</h2>Trust inference procedures<h2>text</h2>First we initialize T to be a zero matrix. Given a pair of users, u and v, we first determine which one of the 4 categories presented above the pattern of the trust information flow from u to v belongs to. If it belongs to the 1st category, set t(u, v) = 1. If it belongs to the 2nd category, we estimate t(u, v) as follows\nt(u, v) = |S(u) S(v)| |S(u) S(v)| ,(6)\nwhere S(i) denotes the set of i's explicit trustees. For the case shown in the 2nd sub-figure of Fig. 2, we then have t(u, v) = 2/3.
