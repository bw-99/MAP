Specifically, we introduce a soft layer that assigns varying weights\nα i = α i 1 , • • • , α i K to learn the relative contribution of different embedding regions of field f i . Trainable variables w i = w i 1 , • • • , w i\nK are introduced to calculate the value of each α i j :\nα i j = exp(w i j /τ ) K j=1 exp(w i j /τ ) , for j = 1, 2, . . . , K,(2)\nwhere τ > 0 is the temperature hyperparameter. Note that the magnitude of the values in e i can be different and easily coupled with other parameters in DNN, making it difficult for the architecture parameters α i to represent the relative importance of different embedding regions. Following [36],\n[45], we adopt the batch normalization [46] technique before the embedding transformation to eliminate the scale issue. The normalized embedding e\ni ′ = e i ′ 1 , • • • , e i ′ d K  is calculated as: e i ′ j = e i j -µ i j (B) [σ i j (B)] 2 + ϵ , for j = 1, 2, . . . , d K ,(3)\nwhere µ i j (B) and σ i j (B) are the mean and standard deviation of e i j over a mini-batch B, and ϵ is a small positive constant to avoid numerical overflow. With this trick, we can force each value in e i ′ to approximately follow the Gaussian distribution N(0, 1), making them comparable with each other. As illustrated in Figure 3, the transformed embedding e i of field f i can be computed as:\ne i = e i ′ ⊙ K j=1 α i j O i j ,(4)\nwhere e i ′ is the output of the batch normalization layer and ⊙ is the element-wise product.\nBy applying Equation (4) to all fields and feeding all output embedding to the target DNN structure, we can obtain the relative importance of different embedding regions in the target model with a training set. Such an end-to-end importance evaluation mechanism allows the DNN model to softly select different embedding regions during model training, and an ideal subset of fields F ⊆ F and the corresponding discrete mixed dimension scheme C A can then be derived after training. </p><h2>publication_ref</h2> <p>['b16', 'b42', 'b35', 'b45'] </p><h2>figure_ref</h2> <p>[] </p><h2>table_ref</h2> <p>[] </p><h2>heading</h2> <p>Loss Function </p><h2>text</h2> <p>In recommendation tasks, it is common for the number of features in different fields to vary greatly. For example, the field Gender usually has two features, while the field Browsed Goods may have millions of features. Therefore, varying even one embedding dimension on fields like Browsed Goods can lead to a significant change in the embedding lookup table size. In order to balance model performance and memory consumption, inspired by [42], we propose a novel regularization term L p to regularize the number of model parameters:\nL p = N i=1 |f i | N j=1 |f j | × K m=1 c m α i m ,(5)\nc m = d 1 , m = 1; d m -d m-1 , otherwise,(6)\nwhere |f i | indicates the number of features contained in field f i and c m represents the size of the embedding region that operator O i m controls. We intuitively expect the weighting scheme of L p to penalize those fields and regions with large cardinality, thus facilitating the compression of the model. In this paper, we focus on the CTR prediction task, where cross-entropy loss is commonly used. We combine it with L p to define the loss function of the pretraining stage as follows:\nL(y, ŷ) = -y log ŷ -(1 -y) log(1 -ŷ) + λL p ,(7)\nwhere y ∈ 0, 1 is the real label, ŷ ∈ [0, 1] is the predicted probability of y = 1, and the hyperparameter λ is a coefficient to control the degree of regularization. </p><h2>publication_ref</h2> <p>['b41'] </p><h2>figure_ref</h2> <p>[] </p><h2>table_ref</h2> <p>[] </p><h2>heading</h2> <p>Algorithm 1: </p><h2>text</h2> <p>The CPT-based Pruning Algorithm\nInput: The value of α i after pretraining, the threshold cpt (0 ≤ cpt ≤ 1), and the search space\nD = d 1 , • • • , d K .\nOutput: a pruned dimension size d fi assigned to\n######################\noutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>I-RAZOR<|>CONCEPT<|>i-Razor is a proposed algorithm that focuses on embedding transformation and dimension search in machine learning, particularly for feature selection in recommendation systems.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DARTS<|>CONCEPT<|>DARTS (Differentiable Architecture Search) is a method that inspires the formulation of joint optimization problems in machine learning, particularly in the context of feature selection and architecture parameters.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BATCH NORMALIZATION<|>CONCEPT<|>Batch normalization is a technique used in deep learning to normalize the inputs of each layer, improving training speed and stability.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CTR PREDICTION<|>CONCEPT<|>Click-Through Rate (CTR) prediction is a task in machine learning that aims to predict the likelihood of a user clicking on a particular item or advertisement.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LOSS FUNCTION<|>CONCEPT<|>A loss function is a mathematical function used to measure the difference between predicted values and actual values in machine learning models, guiding the optimization process.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>REGULARIZATION TERM<|>CONCEPT<|>A regularization term is an additional term added to the loss function to prevent overfitting by penalizing large coefficients in the model.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>FEATURE SELECTION<|>CONCEPT<|>Feature selection is the process of selecting a subset of relevant features for use in model construction, improving model performance and interpretability.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>I-RAZOR<|>DARTS<|>i-Razor is inspired by DARTS, which formulates the problem of joint optimization in feature selection and architecture parameters.<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>I-RAZOR<|>BATCH NORMALIZATION<|>i-Razor adopts batch normalization to eliminate scale issues before embedding transformation, enhancing model performance.<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CTR PREDICTION<|>LOSS FUNCTION<|>In CTR prediction tasks, the loss function is crucial for evaluating model performance and guiding the training process.<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>LOSS FUNCTION<|>REGULARIZATION TERM<|>The regularization term is incorporated into the loss function to control model complexity and prevent overfitting.<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>I-RAZOR<|>FEATURE SELECTION<|>i-Razor focuses on feature selection as part of its optimization process, aiming to improve model performance in recommendation systems.<|>7)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
