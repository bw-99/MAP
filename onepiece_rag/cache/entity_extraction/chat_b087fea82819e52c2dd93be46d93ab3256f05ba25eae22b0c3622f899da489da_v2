(50\n)\nLemma 1 follows from the exchangeability of the indicator random variables {1[D i,ℓ ]; i = 1, . . . , n} upon writing\nX ℓ = n i=1 1[D i,ℓ ].\nInterested reader is referred to the full version [41] for details.\nIn view of (49), we will obtain (47) once we show that\nlim n→+∞ (nP [D x,ℓ ]) = +∞.(51)\nunder (45) and (46). Also, from (49) and (50), we get\nE X ℓ 2 E X ℓ 2 = 1 nP [D x,ℓ ] + n -1 n • P [D x,ℓ D y,ℓ ] P [D x,ℓ ] 2 . (52\n)\nThus, (48) will follow upon showing (51) and\nP [D x,ℓ D y,ℓ ] ∼ P [D x,ℓ ] 2(53)\nfor some ℓ = 0, 1, . . . , k -1 under ( 45) and (46). We establish (51) and (53) from of the following two results.<h2>publication_ref</h2>['b10', 'b40', 'b44', 'b45', 'b45']<h2>figure_ref</h2>[]<h2>table_ref</h2>[]<h2>heading</h2>Lemma 2.<h2>text</h2>If p e = o 1 √ n , then for any non-negative integer constant ℓ and any node v x ,\nP [D x,ℓ ] ∼ (ℓ!) -1 (p e n) ℓ e -pen .(54)\nA proof of Lemma 2 is given in Appendix C-A. (a) If there exist an ǫ > 0 such that p e n > ǫ for all n sufficiently large, then for any non-negative integer constant ℓ and any two distinct nodes v x and v y , we have\nP [D x,ℓ ∩ D y,ℓ ] ∼ (ℓ!) -2 (p e n) 2ℓ e -2pen . (55\n)\n(b) For any two distinct nodes v x and v y , we have\nP [D x,0 ∩ D y,0 ] ∼ e -2pen .(56)\nProof.\nRecalling that E xy is the event that nodes v x and v y are adjacent, we have\nP [D x,ℓ ∩ D y,ℓ ] = P[D x,ℓ ∩ D y,ℓ ∩ E xy ] + P[D x,ℓ ∩ D y,ℓ ∩ E xy ].(57)\nThus, Lemma 3 will follow from the following two results.\nProposition 1. Let p s = o(1), K n ≥ 2 for all n sufficiently large and p e = ln n+(k-1) ln ln n+αn n with lim n→∞ α n = -∞. Then, the following two properties hold.\n(a) If there exist an ǫ > 0 such that p e n > ǫ for all n sufficiently large, then for any non-negative integer constant ℓ, we have\nP[D x,ℓ ∩ D y,ℓ ∩ E xy ] ∼ (ℓ!) -2 (p e n) 2ℓ e -2pen . (58\n) (b) We have P[D x,0 ∩ D y,0 ∩ E xy ] ∼ e -2pen .(59)\nProposition 2. Let p s = o(1), K n ≥ 2 for all n sufficiently large and p e = ln n+(k-1) ln ln n+αn n with lim n→∞ α n = -∞. If there exists an ǫ > 0 such that p e n > ǫ for all n sufficiently large, then for any positive integer constant ℓ, we have\nP[D x,ℓ ∩ D y,ℓ ∩ E xy ] = o P[D x,ℓ ∩ D y,ℓ ∩ E xy ] . (60)\nPropositions 1 and 2 are established in Section VII and Section VIII, respectively. Now, we complete the proof of Lemma 3. Under the condition p e n > ǫ > 0, (55) follows from (58) and (60) in view of (57). For ℓ = 0, we obtain (56) by using (59) in (57) and noting that P[D x,0 ∩D y,0 ∩E xy ] = 0 always holds; it is not possible for nodes v x and v y to have degree zero and yet to have an edge in between.\nWe now complete the proof of ( 51) and ( 53) under ( 45) and (46). First, in view of ( 9) and the condition lim n→∞ α n = -∞, we obtain p e ≤ ln n+(k-1) ln ln n n for all n sufficiently large. Thus, p e = o 1\n√ n , and we use Lemma\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}}
