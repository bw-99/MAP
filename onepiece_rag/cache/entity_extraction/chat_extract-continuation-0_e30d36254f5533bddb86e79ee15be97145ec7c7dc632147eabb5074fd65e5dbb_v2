Ragam representation learning using node2vec<h2>text</h2>The structural knowledge from the ragam network can help the recommender model to give better results to the user based on their co-occurrence. We use a network embedding model: node2vec [23] to extract features of nodes in the raaga network. This model capture the node context with k-iterations of random walks of length l along with the optimization function given in Equation 1max\nf v∈R logP (N (v)|f (v))(1)\nwhere N (v) is the neighbor nodes of node v and the likelihood of the neighborhood of a node is modeled as a softmax function given in Equation 2\nP (N (v)|f (v)) = m∈N (v) exp(f (m).f (v)) w∈Rexp(f (w).f (v)) (2)\nThus with node2vec, we collect feature representation of each ragam from all the concerts. Since each data instance is given as a set of ragams in a concert, we aggregate the ragam vectors. Like many other session based applications, the number of songs in every music concerts also vary. Our model handles such variable length inputs by padding zero vector(s). Since order in the song sequence given in the feature vector may have different priorities, we use an attention model to get the concert vector (V c1 ) (given in Equation 3)\nV c1 = k i=1 σ(W 1 s i-1 + W 2 s i + c)s i (3\n)\nwhere\nW 1 , W 2 ∈ R d * d\n, k is the number of songs in the concert, and s is the vector representation of the given ragam i.<h2>publication_ref</h2>['b22']<h2>figure_ref</h2>[]<h2>table_ref</h2>[]<h2>heading</h2>C. Representing the hand picked features<h2>text</h2>Instead of optimizing the learning model (like node2vec), we give a simple strategy to embed a concert (or a set of songs/raaga) into a vector space. In other words, we represent a concert a distribution of concert features (audava,shadava, and sampoorna for example). All features considered for this study is given in Table I. For a given concert, we create one-hot encoded vectors for each ragam based on these hand picked features. We aggregate the features with element-wise average on all the vectors. Thus we represent entire concert into a vector space(V c2 ).<h2>publication_ref</h2>[]<h2>figure_ref</h2>[]<h2>table_ref</h2>[]<h2>heading</h2>D. RagamAI model<h2>text</h2>With concert vectors from the attention model (V c1 ) and the concert embedding model (V c2 ), we perform a linear transformation after concatenating the vectors to obtain the aggregate vector using the Equation 4\nV g = W 3 (V c1 ⊕ V c2 )(4)\nWe apply softmax function to get the |R| -dimensional output vector (y ), where each element in y vector represent a score for each ragam for recommendations and |R| is total number of nodes in the raaga network G.\nWe use cross-entropy, given in Equation 5, as a loss function for training the proposed model.\nL(y ) = - |R| i=1 y i log(y i ) + (1 -y i )log(1 -y i )(5)<h2>publication_ref</h2>[]<h2>figure_ref</h2>[]<h2>table_ref</h2>[]<h2>heading</h2>V. EXPERIMENTS AND RESULTS<h2>text</h2><h2>publication_ref</h2>[]<h2>figure_ref</h2>[]<h2>table_ref</h2>[]<h2>heading</h2>A. Dataset<h2>text</h2>We use the real world data consisting of concerts performed by multiple Indian classical musicians. The data comprises of 1664 concerts performed between 1984 and 2019 with more than 800 unique songs and 280 unique ragams. Each concert is a set of songs, where each song can map to its corresponding ragam. A performer's creativity, impromptu improvisations, and different song durations during the concert, the number of songs in each concert is a dynamic value. Also, since all these concerts are performed in several locations around the world, the songs and the concert style (organization of songs and ragams) are unique. In Figure 3, we give basic data distribution available in our data. As implied in Figure 3a, most concerts have in the range of 9-16 songs. Figure 3b,3c, and3d give distribution of other features in concerts and we give proportion of songs matching these features in concerts. For example, Figure 3b gives the ratio of number of songs in a concert is janya or melakartha ragam, and Figure 3d gives the ratio of types of ragams in concerts(audava,sampoorna,vakra, and other ragams). Due to space constraints, we neglected the distribution of rarely occurring type of ragam(shadava ragam) from this figure.
