Crossbar arrays can leverage the FeFET technology [18].\n3) Communication inside iMARS: Data among the different hardware components of iMARS need to be communicated. To ensure such communication does not incur too much overhead, we carefully design communication channels inside iMARS. There are two types of communication in iMARS: (1) communication among the different functional blocks and (2) communication between the mats in each CMA bank. While (1) leverages the RecSys communication (RSC) bus, (2) occurs through the intra-bank communication (IBC) network. The RSC bus and the IBC network are depicted in Fig. 3(a) and (b), respectively.\nThe RSC bus enables the exchange of inputs/outputs through the different hardware blocks in iMARS. While data traffic between the different hardware blocks is essential to the system's overall functionality, the data traffic through the RSC bus is not as intense as the traffic inside the memory banks that store the ETs. Data communication on the IBC network and the RSC bus is serialized to minimize the wiring overhead (thus, reducing the area of iMARS). iMARS is designed for a RSC bus with 256-bit capacity. The IBC, on the other hand, supports the transmission of 128 bytes of data (i.e., four 256bit inputs) to be added up inside the intra-bank adder tree (bottom right of Fig. 3(b)) in one shot. Data communication on the IBC network is serialized when K >4 (the fan-in of the \"Intra-bank Adder Tree\"). The IBC network capacity and the number of \"Intra-bank Adder Tree\" fan-ins are design choices that must take into consideration the impact on area footprint, delay and energy. For instance, extremely wide buses may be impractical as they require too much area to be implemented. On the other hand, a narrow IBC would require many data fetches through the bus across K mats. The overhead of communication with the RSC bus/IBC network is accounted for in the results reported in Sec. IV.\nData traffic inside the RSC and the IBC is orchestrated by a controller circuit (indicated by the box labeled CTRL in Fig. 3(a)). The controller circuit consists of a clock generator and two counters that keep track of (i) the activated bank, and (ii) the mats inside the bank that are sending outputs for accumulation with the \"Intra-bank Adder Tree\" circuit. Data packets always travel through the IBC in a predetermined order, as defined by the counters (i.e., in Bank B, from Mat-1, Mat-2, ..., Mat-M in groups of four outputs, i.e., 128 bytes). The pre-defined communication pattern reduces conflicting accesses and eliminates the need for routers. </p><h2>publication_ref</h2> <p>['b8', 'b8', 'b8', 'b7', 'b17'] </p><h2>figure_ref</h2> <p>['fig_2', 'fig_2', 'fig_2', 'fig_2', 'fig_2', 'fig_2', 'fig_2', 'fig_2', 'fig_2'] </p><h2>table_ref</h2> <p>[] </p><h2>heading</h2> <p>B. Embedding Table Mapping </p><h2>text</h2> <p>The iMARS architecture uses CMAs to store ETs., which have varying number of entries (typically 3-30,000 entries). Each row on the CMA represents an entry of an ET. Designing CMAs with varying sizes is not practical. We determined the optimal array-level CMA to be the size of 256 √ó 256 based on circuit-level simulations. Some of the ETs can fit in a single CMA and some require multiple CMAs. The number of CMAs needed to store an ET is n/R where n is the number of entries in the ET and R is the number of rows in the CMA. If n/R < C, we only need one mat, otherwise the number of mats needed to be activated is equal to n/(RC). Each sparse feature is mapped to a separate bank. Hence, the number of activated banks depends on the number of sparse features.\nWe quantize all ETs to 8-bit integer precision to reduce the memory requirement. We also replace the cosine-distance based NNS in the original filtering stage with the IMC-friendly Hamming-distance based NNS. To facilitate the Hamming distance search, we employ a locality-sensitive hashing (LSH) technique on the ItET [5]. Each row of the ItET includes the additional bits for storing the corresponding LSH values. Finally, a fixed-radius near neighbor search instead of top-k search is employed. The fixed-radius near neighbor search is amenable to the threshold-based match offered by the TCAM implementation, and reduces the total number of required operations. Algorithm-level evaluation will be presented in Sec. IV to study the effects of the adjustment on accuracy. We use a 256 LSH signature length which requires 2 CMAs to store a single entry. </p><h2>publication_ref</h2> <p>['b4'] </p><h2>figure_ref</h2> <p>[] </p><h2>table_ref</h2> <p>[] </p><h2>heading</h2> <p>C.
