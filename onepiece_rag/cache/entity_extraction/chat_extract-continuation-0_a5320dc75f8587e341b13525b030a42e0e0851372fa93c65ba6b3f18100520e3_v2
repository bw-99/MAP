For the case shown in the 2nd sub-figure of Fig. 2, we then have t(u, v) = 2/3. Now we focus on the case in which the pattern of the trust information flow from u to v belongs to the 3rd category. We consider every user pair {i, j} that belongs to any one of the aforementioned two categories and estimate t(i, j) correspondingly. Then we exploit trust propagation over the trust network defined by T to estimate t for user pairs associated with the 3rd category. We treat the trust matrix T as a weighted directed graph G, in which the nodes denote the users and the weight of an edge denotes the trust of the starting vertex on the end vertex. For a pair of users, say u and v, there may be multiple paths originating from u and ending at v, as exemplified in the 3rd sub-figure of Fig. 2. To compute t(u, v), we first build up a reciprocal trust matrix Tr , whose (i, j)th cell tr (i, j) = 1/ t(i, j) if t(i, j) > 0; otherwise, set tr (i, j) = âˆž. We treat the reciprocal trust matrix as a weighted directed graph G r . An exemplary show of the transformation from G to G r is presented in Fig. 3. Then we consider a shortest path problem [17], which aims to find the shortest path from u to v, denoted by SP r (u, v), in G r . The Dijkstra's algorithm [18] is employed here to find SP r (u, v).\nThen we set t(u, v) as follows\nt(u, v) = 1 M Ã— L(SP r (u, v)) ,(7)\nwhere L(â€¢) and M denote the length of a path and the number of nodes except the starting node included in the shortest path, respectively. For the sake of clarity, consider the case shown in the right graph of Fig. 3, for which the shortest path from u\nto v, SP r (u, v), is u â†’ k â†’ v, L(SP r (u, v)) = tr (u, k) + tr (k, v) = 4, M = 2 and thus t(u, v) = 1/8.\nIf the pattern of the trust information flow from u to v does not belong to any of the above mentioned categories, it then must belong to the 4th category, for which we set t(u, v) = 0. It is worth noting that, given T , the computation of t(u, v) for all cases included in the 1st, 3rd and 4th categories can be unified by a single formula as follows\nt(u, v) = 1 M Ã— M-1 m=1 1 t(pm,pm+1) , (8\n)\nwhere  8), we can infer that, provided all the other conditions are the same, the bigger the value of M is or the smaller the value of t(p m , p m+1 ) is, the smaller the value of t(u, v) will be, and vice versa. The above effect is consistent with our intuitive understanding of the property of transitivity in the trust type relationships between a pair of users.\np 1 = u, p M = v and p 1 â†’ p 2 â†’ . . . â†’ p M is the shortest path in G r from u to v.<h2>publication_ref</h2>['b16', 'b17']<h2>figure_ref</h2>['fig_1', 'fig_1']<h2>table_ref</h2>[]<h2>heading</h2>Connections to related work<h2>text</h2>The iTrace algorithm proposed here finds connections to several existent TaCF methods in the literature. The algorithm architecture of iTrace falls within a generic TaCF framework presented in [9], while the implicit inference procedure of iTrace presented here is unique. In a variety of existent TaCF methods [16,[19][20][21][22], the trust score is derived from the user rating data. To this regard, trust inference and the computation of user similarity are performed based on exactly the same information source. In contrast with the aforementioned work, the iTrace algorithm employs not only the user rating data but also data other than user rating, namely the explicit user trust data. Since the explicit trust data and the rating data are processed independently, the iTrace has the advantage of making full use of two complementary views in rating prediction. Furthermore, since the trust inference procedure can be performed offline prior to calculation of user similarity, the computation time of the iTrace for online rating predictions is similar to traditional CF methods. The iTrace algorithm also finds connections to our previous work on trust modeling in the context of wireless sensor networks [23][24][25]. Although the same term trust is used, its physical meaning is different. In iTrace, the term trust represents a classical social relationship among users, while in [23][24][25], it is an artificially designed concept related to abnormal sensory behaviors caused by sensor faults.\nTo our knowledge, the most similar work to our algorithm is a trust based CF method presented in [26], which has come to our attention only recently. In contrast with [26], we provide a new and more efficient way for readers to understand the shortest path based formulation\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>ITRACE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>iTrace is an algorithm that finds connections to various existing Trust and Collaborative Filtering (TaCF) methods in the literature, utilizing both user rating data and explicit user trust data for rating predictions.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>TA_CF METHODS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Trust and Collaborative Filtering (TaCF) methods are algorithms that derive trust scores from user rating data and are used for predicting user preferences.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DIJKSTRA'S ALGORITHM<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Dijkstra's algorithm is a method used to find the shortest path in a weighted graph, which is employed in the context of the iTrace algorithm to compute trust relationships.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>TRUST MATRIX<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The trust matrix T is a weighted directed graph representing the trust relationships between users, where nodes denote users and edges denote trust levels.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>USER RATING DATA<|>ORGANIZATION<|>User rating data is information collected from users about their preferences, which is used in trust inference and similarity computation in collaborative filtering.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>EXPLICIT USER TRUST DATA<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Explicit user trust data refers to the direct trust relationships that users have with one another, which is utilized in the iTrace algorithm for improved predictions.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ITRACE<|>TA_CF METHODS<|>iTrace finds connections to existing TaCF methods and improves upon them by using both user rating and explicit trust data<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ITRACE<|>DIJKSTRA'S ALGORITHM<|>iTrace employs Dijkstra's algorithm to compute the shortest path in the trust network<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>TRUST MATRIX<|>ITRACE<|>The trust matrix is utilized by iTrace to represent and analyze trust relationships among users<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>USER RATING DATA<|>ITRACE<|>iTrace uses user rating data as one of the sources for trust inference and rating prediction<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>EXPLICIT USER TRUST DATA<|>ITRACE<|>iTrace incorporates explicit user trust data to enhance the accuracy of its predictions<|>8)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
