Some existing studies [CHL * 03,RSE09,SLFE11] apply visualizations to help manage investment portfolios. FundExplorer [CHL * 03] introduces a distorted treemap to visualize both the composition of a fund's portfolio and the remaining stocks. Their design facilitates the convenient retrieval of complementary funds to achieve portfolio diversification. FinVis [RSE09] employs visualization to help non-experts understand the expected returns, risks and the changing context of multiple portfolios. PortfolioCompare [SLFE11] displays the variability and correlation of a portfolio's risks and returns by scatterplots and distribution charts. Their designs can assist users in making better investments according to their risk preferences. None of these visualization tools is integrated with predictive and feature selection models for factor investing.<h2>publication_ref</h2>[]<h2>figure_ref</h2>[]<h2>table_ref</h2>[]<h2>heading</h2>Interactive Feature Selection<h2>text</h2>Feature selection is a key step in machine learning. Prior studies have focused on algorithmic feature selections [LCW * 17], whose mechanism and reasoning are often opaque to users. Inspired by prior research on predictive model visualization [LXL * 18, PKWQ20,ZWLC19,MQB19,EASD * 19], interactive feature selections have been widely studied. These studies allow users to visually explore the feature space by novel representations and interactive interfaces. Seo and Shneiderman [JS04] proposed a rankby-feature framework for the exploration of multidimensional data. Data features are ranked and visualized by scatter plots, bar charts, etc. Johansson and Johansson [JJ09] utilized parallel coordinates to visualize data features, with the order determined by user-defined metrics.\nOn the other hand, there are some works considering the relationship between features and predictive models. For example, SmartStripes [MBD *  11]  Existing studies summarize the feature dependency or performance by hybrid quality measures (e.g., feature ranking), but the temporal evolution of features are rarely considered. In factor investing, the temporal dynamics of financial factors (features) and their influence on the prediction model are crucial, which makes existing work not suitable for our scenario.<h2>publication_ref</h2>[]<h2>figure_ref</h2>[]<h2>table_ref</h2>[]<h2>heading</h2>System Overview<h2>text</h2>In this section, the technical background of interactive factor investing is introduced, on which key user requirements are summarized.\nTo meet these requirements, four user tasks are defined which are achieved by a pipeline design in our system.<h2>publication_ref</h2>[]<h2>figure_ref</h2>[]<h2>table_ref</h2>[]<h2>heading</h2>Background<h2>text</h2>Historically, factor investing originated from the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM) proposed by Sharpe [Sha64] and Linter [Lin65], which uses a single factor of a stock's sensitivity to market returns to explain stock returns. Then, researchers and practitioners continued to discover new factors related to stock returns. Notably, Fama and French [FF92] proposed the famous three-factor model which considers a size factor (large v.s. small capitalization stocks) and a value factor (high v.s. low book-to-market ratios) in addition to the market sensitivity factor. Later, many factors explaining stock returns were discovered, including a company's recent fundamental data [Asn97], the long-term income growth of companies [PLdSSV98, DS97], etc.\nIn a typical quantitative investment scenario for stock markets, traders hold a portfolio composed of a collection of individual stocks appropriately mixed in value. The portfolio is adjusted in regular time intervals, which is also known as the trading cycle. Depending on the style of traders and funds, the trading cycle can range from one day/week (e.g., private equity) to several months (e.g., public funds). By the factor investing paradigm, at the beginning of each trading cycle, traders pick a few factors based on their experience, domain knowledge, market status and factor returns. Quantitative models are then built up over historical market data, which try to establish linkages between factors and stock returns. Both machine learning and statistical models have been applied in this stage [CG20]. From model-predicted stock returns, traders further apply a trading strategy to determine how to adjust their investment assets, i.e., when and which stocks to buy/sell. Because it is extremely hard to forecast how the portfolio adjustment decision performs in the upcoming trading cycle, a standard backtesting helps to evaluate its returns on historical data. The model consistently earns excess returns to the market, or at least in recent cycles, is considered good in the context of quantitative investment.<h2>publication_ref</h2>['b15', 'b0']<h2>figure_ref</h2>[]<h2>table_ref</h2>[]<h2>heading</h2>Task Characterization<h2>text</h2>The factor investing paradigm introduced above seems straightforward. However, due to the closedness of the quantitative investment community, we only came to this understanding after pilot studies with expert traders in several mutual funds, both public and private ones. In the interviews, almost all of them mentioned a key difficulty in the factor investing practice, the selection of valuable factors. While during their long-term jobs, a number of factor combinations proven in the past have been accumulated, they never stop finding and evaluating new factors because stock fluctuations in the future can hardly be entirely the same as the past. In a sense, the ability to discover new factors is the central competence\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>FUND EXPLORER<|>ORGANIZATION<|>FundExplorer is a tool that visualizes the composition of a fund's portfolio and helps in achieving portfolio diversification.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>FINVIS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>FinVis is a visualization tool that assists non-experts in understanding expected returns, risks, and the context of multiple portfolios.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PORTFOLIOCOMPARE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>PortfolioCompare is a tool that displays the variability and correlation of a portfolio's risks and returns using scatterplots and distribution charts.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SHARPE<|>PERSON<|>Sharpe is a researcher known for proposing the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM) which explains stock returns based on market sensitivity.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LINTER<|>PERSON<|>Linter is a researcher who contributed to the development of the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM) alongside Sharpe.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>FAMA AND FRENCH<|>PERSON<|>Fama and French are researchers known for proposing the three-factor model that includes size and value factors in addition to market sensitivity.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CAPITAL ASSET PRICING MODEL<|>EVENT<|>The Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM) is a financial model that describes the relationship between systematic risk and expected return.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>THREE-FACTOR MODEL<|>EVENT<|>The three-factor model proposed by Fama and French includes factors for size and value in addition to market sensitivity to explain stock returns.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>FUND EXPLORER<|>FINVIS<|>Both FundExplorer and FinVis are tools that utilize visualization to aid in investment decision-making and portfolio management.<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>FUND EXPLORER<|>PORTFOLIOCOMPARE<|>FundExplorer and PortfolioCompare both assist users in managing investment portfolios through visualization techniques.<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>FINVIS<|>PORTFOLIOCOMPARE<|>FinVis and PortfolioCompare both provide visualizations that help users understand risks and returns in investment portfolios.<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SHARPE<|>CAPITAL ASSET PRICING MODEL<|>Sharpe is the proposer of the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM), which is a foundational concept in finance.<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>LINTER<|>CAPITAL ASSET PRICING MODEL<|>Linter collaborated with Sharpe in the development of the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM).<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>FAMA AND FRENCH<|>THREE-FACTOR MODEL<|>Fama and French proposed the three-factor model, which builds upon the concepts introduced in the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM).<|>8)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
