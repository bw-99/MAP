More frequently, s/he focuses on a few sectors (per funder's requirements) and picked several stocks from each sector to construct a balanced initial stock portfolio. Our system provides an interface to allow users to manually determine the initial stock portfolio from the list of stocks organized by sectors. Initial factor selections are automatically recommended based on the stock portfolio. (R1.1) T2. Evaluation of factors through visualization. Our system illustrates the performance of individual factors in a comprehensive visualization interface. Users can visually identify valuable factors by examining key dimensions such as stability and sensitivity. The stock returns of quantitative models are also displayed. (R1.2) T3. Interactive joint factor refinement and portfolio adjustment. Traders select factors and stocks to construct investment portfolios in an interactive and iterative manner. Upon each refinement of factors or stock portfolio, the stock return of the resulting model is displayed immediately, which provides visual evidence for user's heuristic factor search. (R2) T4. Evaluation and comparison of portfolio returns. To compute portfolio returns, quantitative models are automatically built up over selected factors (R3.1). Traders compare the temporal dynamics of returns from alternative portfolios and select the best portfolio in a standard backtesting (R3.2). </p><h2>publication_ref</h2> <p>[] </p><h2>figure_ref</h2> <p>[] </p><h2>table_ref</h2> <p>[] </p><h2>heading</h2> <p>System Design </p><h2>text</h2> <p>We propose iQUANT, a visual analytics system supporint all the four user tasks defined above. iQUANT features a pipelined design as shown in Figure 1. In the first stage, the system takes three types of stock market data. The first type is stock transaction data, notably the stock daily opening/closing prices. The second type is market information, including but not limited to financial statements (total assets, debts, cash flows, etc.), market news, and financial reports. The third and most critical part of data are factors computed from stock transactions and market information, which is used in our system for user selection and model building. In this application, we apply data from a major stock market consisting of 3,000 stocks during 30 years (1990-2018). The data is collected from both external sources (e.g., open APIs for transaction data) or by internal computations (e.g., financial factors). The underlying technique of our system can be easily extended to support other stock markets.\nIn the second stage of Figure 1, we integrate a sparse regression model to carry out factor selection and return prediction simultaneously. The performance of selected factors and predictive models are visualized in iQUANT . The result of interactive factor investing is evaluated in a standard backtesting view in the final stage.\nThe iQUANT system is a web-based full-stack application. All data are stored in MongoDB. The front-ends use Vue.js and D3.js libraries. The sparse regression model is time-consuming. However, it only takes ∼20 seconds in the back-end to compute a sector (dozen) of stocks and respond to the web browser. All performance is measured in a laptop requesting a four-CPU cloud server. We expect to upgrade the server to further reduce computation time. </p><h2>publication_ref</h2> <p>[] </p><h2>figure_ref</h2> <p>['fig_1', 'fig_1'] </p><h2>table_ref</h2> <p>[] </p><h2>heading</h2> <p>Predictive Analytics </p><h2>text</h2> <p> </p><h2>publication_ref</h2> <p>[] </p><h2>figure_ref</h2> <p>[] </p><h2>table_ref</h2> <p>[] </p><h2>heading</h2> <p>Sparse Regression Model </p><h2>text</h2> <p>The interactive factor investing approach takes two steps to make final decisions on portfolio adjustment. First, the collection of financial factors are used to build models on the pool of candidate stocks for investment. Second, traders evaluate the predicted stock returns by the model and decide on the portfolio adjustment. In iQUANT, the second step is achieved by user interactions with the interface to understand the model output, and using existing trading strategies/algorithms (beyond the scope of this paper). In this part, we describe a suite of sparse regression models applied in the first step to jointly recommend factors (i.e. feature selection) and predict stock returns (i.e., model optimization). The sparse regression model is a popularly-used one in industry. Users can replace it with other statistics/machine learning models with similar output format. We include the sparse regression model to demonstrate the workflow of iQUANT.\nConsider the model for a stock ϒ during a time period of Γ = [T + 1, T + L], where L is the length of Γ and any time t ∈ Γ indicates the tth trading day.
