It provides automatic constructions of closed-form quadratic bounds or utilization bounds for a wide range of applications in real-time systems under fixed-priority scheduling. The key of the framework is a k-point schedulability test or a k-point response time analysis that is based on the utilizations and the execution times of k -1 higher-priority tasks. The natural condition of k 2 Q is a quadratic form for testing the schedulability or analyzing the response time. The response time analysis and the schedulability analysis provided by the framework can be viewed as a \"blackbox\" interface that can result in sufficient utilization-based analysis. Since the framework is independent from the task and platform models, it can be applied to a wide range of applications. We show the generality of k 2 Q by applying it to several different task models. k 2 Q produces better uniprocessor and/or multiprocessor schedulability tests not only for the traditional sporadic task model, but also more expressive task models such as the generalized multi-frame task model and the acyclic task model. Another interesting contribution is that in the past, exponential-time schedulability tests were typically not recommended and most of time ignored due to high complexity. We have successfully shown that exponential-time schedulability tests may lead to good polynomial-time tests (almost automatically) by using the k 2 Q framework. Analogously, a similar concept to test only k points with a different formulation has been studied by us in another framework, called k 2 U, which provides hyperbolic bounds or utilization bounds based on a different formulation of schedulability test. With the quadratic and hyperbolic expressions, k 2 Q and k 2 U frameworks can be used to provide many quantitive features to be measured, like the total utilization bounds, speed-up factors, etc., not only for uniprocessor scheduling but also for multiprocessor scheduling. </p><h1>sections</h1><h2>heading</h2> <p>Introduction </p><h2>text</h2> <p>Analyzing the worst-case timing behaviour to ensure the timeliness of embedded systems is essential for building reliable and dependable components in cyber-physical systems. Due to the interaction and integration with external and physical devices, many real-time and embedded systems are expected to handle a large variety of workloads. Towards such dynamics, several formal real-time task models are established to represent these workloads with various characteristics, such as the the generalized multi-frame task model [8], [45] and the self-suspending task model [37]. To analyze the worstcase response time or to ensure the timeliness of the system, for each of these task models, researchers tend to develop dedicated techniques that result in schedulability tests with different computation complexity and accuracy of the analysis. Although many successful results have been developed, after many real-time systems researchers devoted themselves for many years, there does not exist a general framework that can provide efficient and effective analyses for different task models.\nPrior to this paper, we have presented a general schedulability analysis framework [19], [20], called k 2 U, that can be applied in uniprocessor scheduling and multiprocessor scheduling, as long as the schedulability condition can be written in a specific form to test only k points. For example, to verify the schedulability of a (constrained-deadline) sporadic real-time task τ k under fixed-priority scheduling in uniprocessor systems, the time-demand analysis (TDA) developed in [35] can be adopted.\nThe general concept to obtain sufficient schedulability tests in the k 2 Q framework is to test only a subset of time points for verifying the schedulability. This idea is implemented in the k 2 Q framework by providing a k-point last-release schedulability test, which only needs to test k points under any fixed-priority scheduling when checking schedulability of the task with the k th highest priority in the system. Moreover, this concept is further extended to provide a safe upper bound of the worst-case response time. The response time analysis and the schedulability analysis provided by the framework can be viewed as a \"blackbox\" interface that can result in sufficient utilization-based analysis.\nRelated Work. There have been several results in the literature with respect to utilization-based, e.g., [13], [30], [32], [33], [38], [39], [47], and non-utilization-based, e.g., [17], [27], schedulability tests for the sporadic real-time task model and its generalizations in uniprocessor systems. Most of the existing utilization-based schedulability analyses focus on the total utilization bound. That is, if the total utilization of the task system is no more than the derived bound, the task system is schedulable by the scheduling policy. For example, the total utilization bounds derived in [16], [30], [39] are mainly for rate-monotonic (RM) scheduling, in which the results in [30] can be extended for arbitrary fixed-priority scheduling. Kuo et al. [32] further improve the total utilization bound by using the notion of divisibility. Lee et al.
