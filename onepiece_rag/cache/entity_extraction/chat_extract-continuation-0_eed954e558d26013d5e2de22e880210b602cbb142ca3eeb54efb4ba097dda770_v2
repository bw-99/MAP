This is the case for Lebesgue area measure and the non-transitive relation R defined on the unit square by (\nx 1 , x 2 )R (y 1 , y 2 ) iff y1 2 ≤ x 1 ≤ y 1 and y2 2 ≤ x 2 ≤ y 2 . The sets T k fulfill the requirement of be- ing selections if R * satisfies the weakened transitivity condition xR * y =⇒ po(x) ≤ po(y).\nIt is possible to prove that for the counting measure, finite sets, and partial order relations, all selections offering maximum choice can be obtained when sorting by k-Pareto optimality and taking the first l elements. However, for discrete measures with nonconstant weights the above construction might not yield all selections offering maximum choice. A relative example is given in Fig. 3. The partial order relation represented by its Hasse diagram. [Davey and Priestley, 2002]. The set S is not of the form with A ⊆ T k \\ T * k .

The k-Pareto optimality po((x 1 , x 2 )) is the joint cumulative probability distribution function F (x 1 , x 2 ).
