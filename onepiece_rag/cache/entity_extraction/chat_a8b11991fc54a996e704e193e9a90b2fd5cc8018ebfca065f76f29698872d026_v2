The Base model keeps all fields and the uniform embedding dimensions without any selections, and we derive four variants from iHAS: (i) iHAS-1: This variant is the model directly obtained in the searching stage, i.e., we remove the clustering and retraining stages; (ii) iHAS-2: This variant consists of a searching stage and a retraining stage. After we have the welltrained Bernoulli gates, we select dimensions across all samples to retrain one recommender model instead of separating samples into different clusters for retraining cluster-customized recommender models; (iii) iHAS-3: This variant is the standard iHAS without using the polarization regularizer described in Section 3. initialized vector of the dimension length, making every sample share the same probability for every dimension.\nBased on the results in Table 4, we can find: (i) iHAS and its variants can increase the AUC and decrease the Logloss compared with the Base model, which indicates the necessity of performing selection on embedding dimensions for boosting model performance; (ii) iHAS performs better than iHAS-1, which indicates the necessity of the subsequent clustering and retraining stages; (iii) iHAS-1 outperforms iHAS-2, therefore, separating instances into different groups, i.e., the clustering stage, is beneficial for boosting the performance; (iv) Polarization is vital for acquiring better Bernoulli gates by comparing iHAS with iHAS-3; (v) Respecting the difference between instances can further boost the performance by comparing iHAS with iHAS-4.<h2>publication_ref</h2>[]<h2>figure_ref</h2>[]<h2>table_ref</h2>['tab_5', 'tab_5']<h2>heading</h2>Efficiency Analysis (RQ4)<h2>text</h2>In addition to model performance, efficiency is vital when deploying the recommendation model into online systems, especially inference efficiency. We report the inference time on the whole test set of iHAS and other baselines in Figure 4. We can find that iHAS achieves the least inference time. This is because iHAS feed different test data into its preferred recommender model of smaller size instead of feeding all test data into a single model which may lead to additional inference cost on some data. On the contrary, PEP requires the longest inference time because its embedding table is usually sparse and hardware-unfriendly.<h2>publication_ref</h2>[]<h2>figure_ref</h2>['fig_4']<h2>table_ref</h2>[]<h2>heading</h2>Case Study (RQ5)<h2>text</h2>In this subsection, we first use a case study to investigate the optimal embedding dimensions for each cluster from iHAS. We show the results on Avazu as an example and exclude all anonymous field features in Figure 5.\nWe can observe that: (i) Each field's optimal dimensions greatly vary from one to another (from 4 to 12), which highlights the necessity of dimension search in recommender systems; (ii) idrelated features, e.g., site_id and app_id, typically possess more dimensions. This aligns with human intuition as the id-related features are the core of recommender systems; (iii) Samples within different clusters tend to select different dimensions for each field, which validates our claim that different clusters present different  patterns and should be trained separately to enhance performance and reduce inference time in Section 3.4. Furthermore, we use four samples to illustrate the effectiveness of the iHAS framework consisting of group-customized recommender models. Figure 6 shows four samples grouped into two clusters (two in pink and two in cyan). Each cluster has its customized recommender model. We can find that the predictions are more correct (lower Logloss) if we feed the sample into its corresponding model. However, if feeding all of them together into one of the recommender models, we will receive some wrong predictions.<h2>publication_ref</h2>[]<h2>figure_ref</h2>[]<h2>table_ref</h2>[]<h2>heading</h2>CONCLUSION<h2>text</h2>This study proposes an instance-wise Hierarchical Architecture Search framework, iHAS, as an innovative solution to the challenges associated with identifying optimal embedding dimensions for DLRMs. iHAS employs a three-stage hierarchical training strategy including searching, clustering, and retraining. The searching stage aims to identify the optimal embedding dimensions for each sample across different fields. Subsequent stages of clustering and retraining provide a mechanism for gathering similar samples as clusters and training cluster-customized DLRMs based on the individual optimal dimensions, thereby enhancing recommendation predictions. We conduct extensive experiments on two large-scale datasets to authenticate the efficacy of the proposed framework. The results demonstrate that iHAS could boost the\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}}
