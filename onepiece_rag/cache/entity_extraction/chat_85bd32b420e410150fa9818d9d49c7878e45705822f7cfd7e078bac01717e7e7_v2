Compared to the flat Euclidean space, the curved hyperbolic space provides a more amenable and embeddable room, especially for datasets exhibiting implicit tree-like architectures. However, the intricate nature of real-world tree-like data presents a considerable challenge, as it frequently displays a heterogeneous composition of tree-like, flat, and circular regions. The direct embedding of such heterogeneous structures into a homogeneous embedding space (i.e., hyperbolic space) inevitably leads to heavy distortions. To mitigate the aforementioned shortage, this study endeavors to explore the curvature between discrete structure and continuous learning space, aiming at encoding the message conveyed by the network topology in the learning process, thereby improving tree-likeness modeling. To the end, a curvature-aware hyperbolic graph convolutional neural network, ùúÖHGCN, is proposed, which utilizes the curvature to guide message passing and improve long-range propagation. Extensive experiments on node classification and link prediction tasks verify the superiority of the proposal as it consistently outperforms various competitive models by a large margin. </p><h1>sections</h1><h2>heading</h2> <p>INTRODUCTION </p><h2>text</h2> <p>Tree-like structures refer to networks, systems, or data organizations that resemble a tree in their architecture, with nodes branching out from the root into multiple levels. They are widely observed in various real-world domains [1,3,44,53,64,101], such as recommendation systems, financial networks, and social networks.\nRecently, the utilization of hyperbolic space for modeling treelike structures has garnered substantial attention [11,24,45,56,57,61,65,90,96]. Compared with the zero curvature Euclidean space, one key property of negative curvature hyperbolic space is that it expand exponentially, making it can be considered as a continuous tree and vice versa (as shown in Figure 1). In other words, hyperbolic space allows for the efficient representation of a tree-like structure, as it enables nodes to be spread apart as they move away from the root, preventing crowding and overlapping of nodes as is commonly observed in Euclidean space. Additionally, hyperbolic space allows for exponential growth in the number of nodes in a given area, which is well-suited for modeling the exponential growth of trees.\nHowever, the real-world dataset often deviates from a pure tree configuration and manifests in a labyrinthine complexity, posing large challenges for tree-likeness modeling within hyperbolic space [82,103]. For instance, biological taxonomies, which depict the hierarchical relationships between different species from a for ùëá 2 . By incorporating curvature ùúÖ into the neighboring aggregation, the detection of local structures is improved. This is achieved by assigning asymmetric weights (ùúÖ 1 ùëé,ùëú vs ùúÖ 1  ùëé,ùëè ) to nodes at different levels and results in larger values for nodes in a circular shape (ùúÖ 1  ùëé,ùëú vs ùúÖ 2 ùëé,ùëú and ùúÖ 1 ùëé,ùëê vs ùúÖ 2 ùëé,ùëê ).\nglobal view, often exhibit both extensive local flat regions where multiple species are closely related and local circular regions where species connections are less defined. The local structure of a treelike graph exhibits a heterogeneous blend of tree-like, flat, and circular patterns, resulting in difficulties in uniformly embedding the data into a homogeneous embedding space and thereby engendering structural biases and distortions.\nTo mitigate the limitations, this study seeks to examine the intersection between the discrete structure of the data and the continuous learning space. The aim is to encode the information inherent in the network topology in a manner that is both effective and imbued with structural inductive bias, thereby enhancing the performance of downstream tasks. From a geometric perspective, the quality of the embedding in geometric learning depends on the compatibility between the intrinsic graph structure and the embedding space [26]. In light of this principle, we employs the concept of curvature to guide tree-likeness modeling in hyperbolic space. As shown in Figure 2, the incorporation of curvature information offers a more comprehensive grasp of the local shape characteristics, facilitating the representation of the shape and contours of diverse regions within the learning space.\nIn Riemannian geometry, curvature measures the deviation of a geometric object from being flat, originally defined on continuous smooth manifolds [40]. Smooth manifolds with positive, zero, or negative curvature are spherical, Euclidean, and hyperbolic spaces, respectively. This concept has been extended to discrete objects such as graphs, where curvature describes the deviation of a local pair of neighborhoods from a \"flat\" case.\nGraph curvature, analogous to curvature in the realm of continuous geometry, consists of Gaussian curvature, Ricci curvature, and mean curvature. These components have unique roles: Gaussian curvature quantifies the local curvature at vertices, Ricci curvature allocates curvature to the edges, and mean curvature provides an overall metric for the entire graph. In this work, we focus on Ricci curvature for graph convolution and edge-based filtering. Several definitions have been proposed about Ricci curvature, including Ollivier Ricci curvature [58], Forman Ricci curvature [21], Balanced Forman curvature [74]. Ricci curvature controls the overlap between two distance balls by considering the radii of the balls and the distance between their centers [33].
