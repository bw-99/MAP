To be specific, in a mixed dimension scheme, different features can have different embedding dimensions. There are two types of dimension search methods: featurelevel and field-level. Feature-level methods aim to assign different embedding dimensions to different features within the same field. For example, NIS [18] applies reinforcement learning to generate decision sequences on the selection of dimensions for different features. Other heuristic approaches, such as MDE [39], DPG [40], and MGQE [41], attempt to assign higher dimensions to features with higher frequencies. However, these methods suffer from numerous unique values in each field, while the feature frequencies are highly dynamic and not pre-known in real-life situations. Although the frequency of different features can be estimated by sampling, the fine-grained dimension search at feature level introduces a sizeable computational overhead and additional complexity. In this work, we focus on the second group for its efficiency, which aims to allocate different dimensions to different fields, while different features in the same field share a common dimension size. Based on advances in NAS [42], the second type of dimension search method normally adopts an AutoML style to search for the desired embedding dimension from a set of predefined candidate embedding dimensions. Inspired by DARTS [17], [43], AutoDim [19] proposes a differentiable search method to analyze the suitability of different candidate embedding dimensions by calculating the attention coefficients of the corresponding operators. After the search, AutoDim assigns to each field the candidate dimension size whose corresponding operator has maximum attention. DNIS [7] eliminates the dependency on predefined candidate dimensions by directly pruning non-informative embedding blocks whose values are less than a given threshold. Although existing dimension search methods work well in the case of a well-selected subset of fields, their effectiveness in the presence of the original set of fields without feature selection remains understudied.\nSimilar to AutoDim, our objective is to automatically search for the optimal embedding dimension configuration on a given set of embedding dimension candidates. We differ from AutoDim: i) We consider dimension search on the original field set and avoid dimension assignment to useless fields by introducing a novel candidate dimension, i.e., dimension 0. After the search is completed, the redundant dimensions and the fields dominated by dimension 0 will be discarded, which means that dimension search and feature selection can be achieved simultaneously. ii) There is overlap between different candidate dimensions in AutoDim, i.e., the larger embedding dimensions cover the smaller ones, whereas the candidate dimensions in i-Razor do not overlap with each other. iii) Unlike AutoDim, which uses the argmax operator for dimension pruning, we propose a flexible pruning algorithm that allows more fine-grained dimension assignment.<h2>publication_ref</h2>['b6', 'b17', 'b19', 'b38', 'b17', 'b38', 'b39', 'b40', 'b41', 'b16', 'b42', 'b18', 'b6']<h2>figure_ref</h2>[]<h2>table_ref</h2>[]<h2>heading</h2>METHODOLOGY<h2>text</h2>In this section, we first formulate the feature selection and embedding dimension search problem. Then, we describe the proposed i-Razor, a two-stage end-to-end framework to automatically select important fields and assign adaptive dimensions to the selected fields.<h2>publication_ref</h2>[]<h2>figure_ref</h2>[]<h2>table_ref</h2>[]<h2>heading</h2>Problem Formulation<h2>text</h2>We assume that the original field set F consists of N fields, whether useful or not. Meanwhile, taking online resources into consideration, we can roughly give the search space of dimension search:\nD = {d 1 , • • • , d K }, where K represents the number of candidate dimensions and d 1 < • • • < d K .\nA solution A to the input configuration optimization problem involves not only filtering a field subset F ⊆ F in favor of the target DNN model, but also specifying the corresponding embedding dimension size for these selected fields. Denoting the configuration of A by C A = {(f i , d fi ) | f i ∈ F}, we can formulate the problem of finding the configuration that maximizes the performance of the target DNN model as follows:\nmin A L (C A , W (A)) ,(1)\nwhere L is a task-specific loss function, W(A) denotes the optimal parameters of the DNN model under configuration A, and d fi specifies the unified dimension size assigned to all features in field f i .\nFinding the optimal solution to the input configuration optimization problem is an NP-Hard problem, with an incredibly huge space (typical size of 2 N K ) to search for. For the purpose of automatically selecting essential features from a noisy feature set while learning proper dimensions simultaneously without loss of generality and model performance, we propose an end-to-end differentiable framework, i-Razor. The overall framework is illustrated in Figure 2, which is made up of two stages: the pretraining stage and the retraining stage.
