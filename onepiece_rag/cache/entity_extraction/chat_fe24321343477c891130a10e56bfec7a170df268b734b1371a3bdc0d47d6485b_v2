Table 10 provides the comparison matrix. Information on stateof-the-art results are excerpted from their respective publications.\niFixR offers a reasonable performance in patch recommendation when we consider the number of Defects4J bugs that are successfully patched among the top-5 (in a scenario where we assume not having relevant test cases to validate the patch candidates).

We set strong constraints on the absence of test cases, which are used in test-based APR to approximate what the program is actually supposed to do and when the repair is completed [83]. Our experiments on the widely-used Defects4J bugs eventually show that patch generation without bug-triggering test cases is promising.\nManually looking at the details of failures and success in generating patches with iFixR, several insights can be drawn: Test cases can be buggy: During manual analysis of results, we noted that iFixR actually fails to generate correct patches for three bugs (namely, Math-5, Math-59 and Math-65) because even the test cases were buggy. Figure 7 illustrates the example of bug Math-5 where its patch also updated the relevant test case. This example supports our endeavor, given that users would find and report bugs for which the appropriate test cases were never properly written.\n// Patched Source Code: ---a/src/main/java/org/apache/commons/math3/complex/Complex.java +++ b/src/main/java/org/apache/commons/math3/complex/Complex.java @@ -304,3 +304,3 @@ public class Complex if (real == 0.0 && imaginary == 0.  Bug reports deserve more interest: With iFixR, we have shown that bug reports could be handled automatically for a variety of bugs. This is an opportunity for issue trackers to add a recommendation layer to the bug triaging process by integrating patch generation techniques. There are, however, several directions to further investigation, among which: (1) help users write proper bug reports; and (2) re-investigate IRFL techniques at a finer-grained level that is suitable for APR. Prioritization techniques must be investigated: In the absence of complete test suites for validating every single patch candidate, a recommendation system must ensure that patches presented first to the developers are the most likely to be plausible and even correct. There are thus two directions of research that are promising: (1) ensure that fix patterns are properly prioritized to generate good patches and be able to early-stop for not exploding the search space; and (2) ensure that candidate patches are effectively re-prioritized. These investigations must start with a thorough dissection of plausible patches for a deep understanding of plausibility factors. More sophisticated approaches to triaging and selecting fix ingredients are necessary: In its current form, iFixR implements a na√Øve approach to patch generation, ensuring that the performance is tractable.
