Moreover, it is obvious that relaxing the constraint t * j ≥ t * j-1 for j = 2, 3, . . . , k -1 by using t * j ≥ 0 does not increase the corresponding objective function in the linear programming. Therefore, we have\nmin C * k (8a) s.t. C * k + k-1 i=1 α i t * i U i + j-1 i=1 β i C i ≥ t * j , ∀j = 1, 2, . . . , k -1, (8b) t * j ≥ 0, ∀j = 1, 2, . . . , k -1,(8c)\nC * k + k-1 i=1 α i t * i U i + k-1 i=1 β i C i ≥ t k .(8d)\nLet s ≥ 0 be a slack variable such that\nC * k = t k + s - ( k-1 i=1 α i t * i U i + k-1 i=1 β i C i ).\nTherefore, we can replace the objective function and the constraints with the above equality of C * k . The objective function (i.e., Eq. ( 8a)) is to find the minimum value of\nt k + s -( k-1 i=1 α i t * i U i + k-1 i=1 β i C i ) such that Eq. (8b) holds, which is equivalent to t k + s -( k-1 i=1 α i t * i U i + k-1 i=1 β i C i ) + k-1 i=1 α i t * i U i + j-1 i=1 β i C i = t k + s - k-1 i=j β i C i ≥ t * j , ∀j = 1, 2, . . . , k -1.(9)\nFor notational brevity, let t * k be t k +s. Therefore, the linear programming in Eq. ( 8) can be rewritten as follows:\nmin t * k -( k-1 i=1 α i U i t * i + k-1 i=1 β i C i ) (10a) s.t. t * k - k-1 i=j β i C i ≥ t * j , ∀1 ≤ j ≤ k -1, (10b) t * j ≥ 0 ∀1 ≤ j ≤ k -1. (10c) t * k ≥ t k (10d)\nThe remaining proof is to solve the above linear programming to obtain the minimum C * k . Our proof strategy is to solve the linear programming analytically as a function of t * k . This can be imagined as if t * k is given. At the end, we will prove the optimality by considering all possible t * k ≥ t k . This involves three steps:\n• Step 1: we analyze certain properties of optimal solutions based on the extreme point theorem for linear programming [40] under the assumption that t * k is given as a constant, i.e., s is known.\n• Step 2: we present a specific solution in an extreme point, as a function of t * k . • Step 3: we prove that the above extreme point solution gives the minimum\nC * k if k-1 i=1 α i U i ≤ 1.\n[Step 1:] After specifying the value t * k as a given constant, the new linear programming without the constraint in Eq. (10d) has only k -1 variables and 2(k -1) constraints. Thus, according to the extreme point theorem for linear programming [40], the linear constraints form a polyhedron of feasible solutions. The extreme point theorem states that either there is no feasible solution or one of the extreme points in the polyhedron is an optimal solution when the objective of the linear programming is finite. To satisfy Eqs. (10b) and (10c), we know that t * j ≤ t * k for j = 1, 2, . . . , k -1, due to t * i ≥ 0, 0 < β, and C i ≥ 0 for i = j, j + 1, . . . , k -1. As a result, the objective of the above linear programming is finite since a feasible solution has to satisfy t\n* i ≤ t * k for i = 1, 2, . . . , k -1,.\nAccording to the extreme point theorem, one of the extreme points is the optimal solution of Eq. (10). There are k -1 variables with 2k -2 constraints in Eq. ( 10). An extreme point must have at least k -1 active constraints in Eqs. (10b) and (10c), in which their ≥ are set to equality =.\n[Step 2:] One special extreme point solution by setting\nt * j > 0 is to put t * k - k-1 i=j β i C i = t * j for every j = 1, 2, . . . , k -1, i.e., ∀1 ≤ i ≤ k -1, t * i+1 -t * i = β i C i ,(11)\nwhich implies that\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}}
