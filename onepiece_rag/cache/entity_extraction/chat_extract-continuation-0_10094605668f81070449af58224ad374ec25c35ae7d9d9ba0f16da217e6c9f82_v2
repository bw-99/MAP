Road Segment Assesment FIS </p><h2>text</h2> <p>For road segment assessments, inputs from the road surface types and conditions data sets are used to compute three inputs for the FIS. The first input is the related to the total number of road anomalies in a given road segment ùëÜ. For each segment, a normalized percentage of road anomalies ùëÖùê¥ is computed simple through dividing the total number of anomalies over ùëÜ to reflect the density of the anomalies in particular segment. Thus this input is mapped to three membership functions which are defined as low, moderate and high. As shown in fig. 3 we adopted sigmoidal membership function for both low and high functions. A sigmoidal function is a mapping on input vector ùëé, and can be represented by:\nùëì(ùëé, ùëö, ùëõ) = 1 1+exp(-ùëö(ùëé-ùëõ)) (2)\nWhere the sigmoidal membership functions innately open to the right or left according to the sign of the parameter ùëö and ùëõ is a control parameter. The product of two sigmoidal functions is used in the moderate function and is given by: ùëì ùëò (ùëé) = Given that ùëò = 1,2 and the parameters ùëö 1 and ùëö 2 command the left and right curves slopes and these two parameters have to be positive and negative, respectively. While ùëõ 1 and ùëõ 2 control the left and right curves points of inflection.\nThe second input is representing the effect of the anomalies severity level on the assessment of a road segment. As the road segments with equal lengths and have the same density of anomalies should not receive the same assessment decision if they experience different types of anomalies with different levels of severity. Accordingly, the average percentage of anomalies severity level in each segment is calculated and normalized concerning the segment length and presented by mild and severe sigmoid membership functions. Lastly, the third input is to distinguish road segments of single and double lanes. This input was chosen to represent the significance of the road segment wideness on its quality assessment. The road segments with multi-lanes allow the driver to maneuver before the anomalies easily while this is difficult to occur in single road segments and it can lead to dangerous scenarios within the two ways road segments. The third input is also mapped through two sigmoid wide and narrow membership functions. In this FIS, the fuzzification of the inputs is mapped by 11 Mamdani fuzzy rules. The road assessment FIS is then defuzzified to enable three output levels of road segment quality. They are classified into Good, Moderate and poor segments.  </p><h2>publication_ref</h2> <p>[] </p><h2>figure_ref</h2> <p>['fig_0'] </p><h2>table_ref</h2> <p>[] </p><h2>heading</h2> <p>C. Route Suggestion FIS </p><h2>text</h2> <p>Regarding the route suggestions, a cascaded FIS is utilized as shown in fig. 1 to provide route recommendation and evaluation. In this FIS, as shown in fig. 4, there are three inputs adopted to decide the route recommendation. The first input is the average quality of the segments in a potential route. This input is controlled by three membership functions namely poor, moderate and good which reflects one aspect of the route evaluation. We adopted two sigmoid functions for the poor and good membership functions while we used the product of two sigmoidal functions for the moderate one. It is worth mentioning that the primary concern in iDrivesense route planning is in providing high road quality routes. However, high traffic routes and long paths should be avoided as well whenever is possible. Therefore, the second and the third inputs are described by the route travel time and route distance, respectively. The second one is divided by two sigmoid membership functions named slower and faster. On the other hand, the third input is also described by two sigmoid membership functions called longer and shorter. In the route recommendation FIS, the fuzzification of the three inputs is controlled by 12 fuzzy rules. While the defuzzification of this cascaded FIS provides three output levels of route recommendations. They are divided into (not suggested, marginally suggested and suggested). </p><h2>publication_ref</h2> <p>[] </p><h2>figure_ref</h2> <p>['fig_1'] </p><h2>table_ref</h2> <p>[] </p><h2>heading</h2> <p>III. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION </p><h2>text</h2> <p>In order to assess the performance of the proposed system, we conducted extensive experiments in Kingston, ON, Canada. These experiments were held adopting multiple vehicles and included various motion sensors and smart devices. These road experiments involved numerous roads in heavy traffic downtown core, urban and neighborhoods residential areas to assure the variety of road segments quality and routing approaches. Accordingly, to show the performance of the iDriveSense system in route recommendation considering the road quality information. We consider a real trip request as shown in fig. 5. In this trip, the driver requires route planning to travel from point A to point B while requesting a stable and safe drive as the highest priority. According to Google maps, as shown in fig. 6, there are two recommended routes. The first one reaches point B in 5 minutes, and it is 1.3 Km regarding route distance.
