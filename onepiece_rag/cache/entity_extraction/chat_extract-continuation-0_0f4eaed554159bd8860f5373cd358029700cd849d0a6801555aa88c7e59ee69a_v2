Let p n = 1 for all n. In this case, graph G on becomes equivalent to G(n, K n , P n ) with p e = ln n + (k -1) ln ln n + α n ± o(1) n , n = 1, 2, . . .(30)\nFrom ( 30) and ( 20), we have p e n = n\nK 2 n Pn ± o(1) so that i) if there exists an ǫ > 0 such that n K 2 n\nPn > ǫ, then there exists an ǫ ′ > 0 such that p e n > ǫ ′ for all n sufficiently large and ii) if lim n→∞ n K 2 n Pn = 0, then lim n→∞ p e n = 0. Thus, all the conditions enforced by part (a) of Theorem 1 are satisfied for the given K n , P n and p n . Comparing (30) with (9), we get lim n→∞ α n ± o(1) = -∞ and the zero law\nlim n→∞ P [G(n, K n , P n ) is k-connected ] = 0 follows from (10) of Theorem 1.\nWe now establish the one-law. Pick K n , P n such that (20) holds with lim n→∞ α n = +∞, P n = Ω(n) and K n ≥ 2 for all n sufficiently large. In view of [39, Lemma 6.1], there exists Kn , Pn such that Kn ≥ 2 for all n sufficiently large,\nKn ≤ K n and Pn = P n , n = 1, 2, . . . ,and\nK2 n Pn = ln n + (k -1) ln ln n + αn n , n = 1, 2, . . . ,(31)\nwith αn = O(ln n) and lim n→∞ αn = ∞. By an easy coupling argument, it is easy to check that\nP G(n, Kn , Pn ) is k-connected ≤ P [G(n, K n , P n ) is k-connected ] .\nTherefore, the one-law proof will be completed upon showing\nlim n→∞ P G(n, Kn , Pn ) is k-connected = 1.\nUnder (31) we have V. BASIC IDEAS FOR PROVING THEOREM 1<h2>publication_ref</h2>['b29', 'b8', 'b30']<h2>figure_ref</h2>[]<h2>table_ref</h2>[]<h2>heading</h2>A. k-Connectivity vs. Minimum Node Degree<h2>text</h2>It is easy to see that if a graph G is k-connected, then the minimum node degree of G is at least k [29]. Therefore, we have\n[G is k-connected ] ⊆\nMinimum node degree of G is no less than k and the inequality\nP [G is k-connected ] ≤ P Minimum node degree of G is no less than k follows immediately.\nIt is now clear that ( 11) implies ( 10) and ( 12) implies ( 13). Thus, in order to prove Theorem 1, we only need to show (11) under the conditions of case (a), and ( 12) under the conditions of case (b).<h2>publication_ref</h2>['b28', 'b10']<h2>figure_ref</h2>[]<h2>table_ref</h2>[]<h2>heading</h2>B. Confining α n<h2>text</h2>As seen in Section V-A, Theorem 1 will follow if we show (11) and (12) under the appropriate conditions. In this subsection, we show that the extra condition α n = o(ln n) can be introduced in the proof of (12). Namely, we will show that part (b) of Theorem 1 under\nα n = o(ln n) ⇒ part (b) of Theorem 1(32)\nWe write G on as G on (n, K n , P n , p n ) and remember that given K n , P n and p n , one can determine α n from (9); just use (7).\nAssume that part (b) of Theorem 1 holds under the extra condition α n = o(ln n). The desired result (32) will follow if we establish \nlim n→∞ P G(n, Kn , Pn , pn ) is k-connected = 1(33\nand that we have\nP[G on (n, Kn , Pn , pn ) is k-connected ] ≥ P[G on (n, Kn , Pn , pn ) is k-connected ].(38)\nNotice that Kn , Pn and pn satisfy all the conditions enforced by part (b) of Theorem 1 together with the extra condition αn = o(ln n). Thus, we get\nlim n→∞ P[G on (n, Kn , Pn , pn ) is k-connected ] = 1(39)\nby the initial assumption, and (33) follows immediately from (38) and (39). Therefore, given any Kn , Pn and pn as stated above, if we can show the existence of Kn , Pn and\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>THEOREM 1<|>EVENT<|>Theorem 1 is a mathematical statement regarding k-connectivity in graphs and its implications under certain conditions.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GRAPH G<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Graph G is a mathematical structure used to represent pairwise relationships between objects, specifically in the context of k-connectivity.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>K CONNECTIVITY<|>EVENT<|>K connectivity refers to a property of a graph that indicates the minimum number of vertices that need to be removed to disconnect the remaining vertices.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>NODE DEGREE<|>EVENT<|>Node degree is a measure of the number of connections (edges) a node has in a graph, which is relevant in determining k-connectivity.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>α n<|>PERSON<|>α n is a variable representing a sequence in the context of the mathematical proofs related to graph connectivity.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>P n<|>PERSON<|>P n is a variable representing a sequence related to the probability of certain properties in the graph G.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>K n<|>PERSON<|>K n is a variable representing a sequence that defines the number of edges in the graph G.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>THEOREM 1<|>GRAPH G<|>Theorem 1 provides conditions under which graph G is k-connected, establishing a foundational result in graph theory<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>K CONNECTIVITY<|>GRAPH G<|>K connectivity is a property that describes the resilience of graph G against disconnection<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>NODE DEGREE<|>K CONNECTIVITY<|>The minimum node degree is directly related to the k connectivity of a graph, as a higher minimum degree implies greater connectivity<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>α n<|>K n<|>α n is defined in terms of K n, influencing the behavior of the graph's connectivity<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>P n<|>K n<|>P n is a probability measure that is influenced by the number of edges defined by K n in the graph<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>K n<|>GRAPH G<|>K n defines the number of edges in graph G, impacting its structure and properties<|>6)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
