Random key graphs have received much interest recently, owing in part to their wide applicability in various domains including recommender systems, social networks, secure sensor networks, clustering and classification analysis, and cryptanalysis to name a few. In this paper, we study connectivity properties of random key graphs in the presence of unreliable links. Unreliability of the edges are captured by independent Bernoulli random variables, rendering edges of the graph to be on or off independently from each other. The resulting model is an intersection of a random key graph and an Erdős-Rényi graph, and is expected to be useful in capturing various real-world networks; e.g., with secure WSN applications in mind, link unreliability can be attributed to harsh environmental conditions severely impairing transmissions. We present conditions on how to scale this model's parameters so that i) the minimum node degree in the graph is at least k, and ii) the graph is k-connected, both with high probability as the number of nodes becomes large. The results are given in the form of zeroone laws with critical thresholds identified and shown to coincide for both graph properties. These findings improve the previous results by Rybarczyk on the k-connectivity of random key graphs (with reliable links), as well as the zero-one laws by Yagan on the 1-connectivity of random key graphs with unreliable links. </p><h1>sections</h1><h2>heading</h2> <p>I. INTRODUCTION </p><h2>text</h2> <p>Random key graphs have received significant interest recently with applications spanning key predistribution in secure wireless sensor networks (WSNs) [2], [5], [8], [9], [13], social networks [7], [18], [41], recommender systems [27], clustering and classification analysis [4], [19], cryptanalysis of hash functions [3], circuit design [35], and the modeling of epidemics [1] and \"small-world\" networks [38]. They belong to a larger class of random graphs known as random intersection graphs [2]- [7], [10], [14], [28], [34], [35]; in fact, they are referred to as uniform random intersection graphs by some authors [2], [3], [6], [28], [32]- [34], [45], [46].\nTo fix the terminology, we will describe random key graphs in the context of secure WSNs, where they have originated from. Security is expected to be a key challenge in resource constrained sensor networks. A widely accepted solution for securing WSN communications is the random predistribution of cryptographic keys to sensor nodes, and utilization of symmetric-key encryption modes [17], [21], [31] to ensure message secrecy and authenticity. Among various key predistribution algorithms proposed to date, the original scheme by Eschenauer and Gligor (EG) [13] is still the most widely recognized one. According to the EG scheme, each of the n sensors is assigned K n distinct keys that are selected uniformly at random from a key pool of size P n . Two sensors can then securely communicate over an existing communication link if they have at least one key in common; i.e., if they share a common key. This notion of adjacency defines the random key graph, hereafter denoted by G(n, K n , P n ). For generality, K n and P n are assumed to scale with the number of nodes n, with the natural condition 1 ≤ K n ≤ P n always imposed.\nIn this paper, we study connectivity properties of random key graphs in the presence of unreliable links. Unreliability of the edges are captured by independent Bernoulli random variables, rendering each edge of G(n; K n , P n ) to be on (with probability p n ) or off (with probability 1p n ) independently from all other edges. Put differently, we consider an Erdős-Rényi (ER) graph G(n; p n ) [11] on the same set of n vertices, with edges appearing between any pair of vertices independently with probability p n . A random key graph with unreliable links thus corresponds to the intersection of a random key graph and an ER graph. Hereafter, we denote this graph by G on = G(n; K n , p n ) ∩ G(n; p n ); see Section III for precise definitions.\nJust like the random key graph, the G on model can be used in various applications, particularly when links are expected to be unreliable. For example, in a secure WSN application, links might be unreliable due to wireless media of the communication, or due to physical obstacles and altering environmental conditions severally impairing the transmission. We refer the reader to [39] and [41] for two other applications of G on : i) secure connectivity of WSNs under an on-off channel model, and ii) large scale, distributed publish-subscribe services in online social networks, respectively.\nThe main goal of this paper to study k-connectivity of G on . A network (or graph) is said to be k-connected if for each pair of nodes there exist at least k mutually disjoint paths connecting them\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INFORMATION THEORY<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A scholarly journal that publishes research on information theory, including topics like random key graphs and their applications in secure communications.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>JUN ZHAO<|>PERSON<|>Jun Zhao is one of the authors of the paper discussing k-connectivity in random key graphs.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>OSMAN YAGAN<|>PERSON<|>Osman Yagan is a co-author of the paper on k-connectivity in random key graphs.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>VIRGIL GLIGOR<|>PERSON<|>Virgil Gligor is another co-author of the paper discussing random key graphs and their properties.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>RANDOM KEY GRAPHS<|>CONCEPT<|>Random key graphs are a class of random intersection graphs used for securing wireless sensor network communications through key predistribution schemes.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>UNRELIABLE LINKS<|>CONCEPT<|>Unreliable links refer to communication links that may fail or be impaired, affecting the connectivity of networks, particularly in wireless sensor networks.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SECURE WIRELESS SENSOR NETWORKS<|>CONCEPT<|>Secure wireless sensor networks (WSNs) are networks designed to ensure secure communication among sensor nodes, often using key predistribution methods.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>K-CONNECTIVITY<|>CONCEPT<|>K-connectivity is a property of a network that indicates the minimum number of disjoint paths required to connect any two nodes in the network.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ERDŐS-RÉNYI GRAPH<|>CONCEPT<|>An Erdős-Rényi graph is a type of random graph where edges are formed between nodes with a certain probability, used to model various types of networks.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>KEY PREDIStribution<|>CONCEPT<|>Key predistribution is a method used in secure communications where cryptographic keys are distributed to nodes before the network is deployed.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>JUN ZHAO<|>IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INFORMATION THEORY<|>Jun Zhao is an author of the paper published in the IEEE Transactions on Information Theory<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>OSMAN YAGAN<|>IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INFORMATION THEORY<|>Osman Yagan is a co-author of the paper published in the IEEE Transactions on Information Theory<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>VIRGIL GLIGOR<|>IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INFORMATION THEORY<|>Virgil Gligor is a co-author of the paper published in the IEEE Transactions on Information Theory<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>RANDOM KEY GRAPHS<|>SECURE WIRELESS SENSOR NETWORKS<|>Random key graphs are used in secure wireless sensor networks for key predistribution<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>UNRELIABLE LINKS<|>RANDOM KEY GRAPHS<|>Unreliable links affect the connectivity properties of random key graphs<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>K-CONNECTIVITY<|>RANDOM KEY GRAPHS<|>The paper studies the k-connectivity properties of random key graphs<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ERDŐS-RÉNYI GRAPH<|>RANDOM KEY GRAPHS<|>Random key graphs are modeled as intersections of random key graphs and Erdős-Rényi graphs<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>KEY PREDIStribution<|>SECURE WIRELESS SENSOR NETWORKS<|>Key predistribution is a critical method for securing communications in wireless sensor networks<|>8)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
