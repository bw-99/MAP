Prior to training, all segments have been preprocessed in terms of lowercasing, punctuation-and digit removal as well as stemming. The resulting 8000 dimensional segment vectors are then used as input for an ensemble of one-vs-rest binary logistic regression (LR) classifiers. Each classifier is trained for a specific requirement 𝑟 and a maximum of 100 iterations using the \"liblinear\" solver from the scikit-learn python library. Second, we pass the same Tf-Idf representations into an MLP with one hidden layer of dimensionality 1024. In contrast to the binary logistic regression heads, the MLP performs multi-label classification and predicts the relevant requirements simultaneously. We find an optimal batch size of 64 and a learning rate of 1𝑒-3.\nThird, we exchange the Tf-Idf input vectors with frozen contextual embeddings from sustain.AI's BERT model. As classifiers we evaluate the previously defined MLP and a GRU (Gated Recurrent Unit). While the MLP takes BERT's CLS output embedding as input, the bidirectional GRU processes the resulting token representations of the frozen BERT model. Specifically, the last/first hidden state of the forward/backward GRU are concatenated and passed to a sigmoidal output layer. Optimal settings are obtained with a hidden size of 512 neurons, a batch size of 8 and a learning rate of 1𝑒-5. </p><h2>publication_ref</h2> <p>['b12'] </p><h2>figure_ref</h2> <p>[] </p><h2>table_ref</h2> <p>[] </p><h2>heading</h2> <p>Results </p><h2>text</h2> <p>We evaluate and compare sustain.AI and all baseline methods on the previously specified hold out test set for both the GRI and DNK data. Table 3 reports mean sensitivity (MS) and mean average precision (MAP) scores for the top 3 and top 5 recommendations.\nFirst, it can be seen that the overall DNK performance across all methods is much better compared to the GRI data. This was expected, considering the reduced number of requirements and the larger amount of training documents and annotations.\nSecond, we find that the application of weighted random sampling (WRS) during training significantly improves the test set performance of our model. Compared to the version without WRS all metrics have increased by more than 6 percentage points. To enable a fair comparison we apply WRS during the training process of all baseline methods. Also, WRS is solely employed for the GRI data, since the DNK reports do not exhibit any annotation scarcity.\nFinally, the results in Table 3 show the overall superiority of sustain.AI's end-to-end architecture, outperforming all baselines by a large margin. </p><h2>publication_ref</h2> <p>[] </p><h2>figure_ref</h2> <p>[] </p><h2>table_ref</h2> <p>['tab_2', 'tab_2'] </p><h2>heading</h2> <p>CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK </p><h2>text</h2> <p>We presented sustain.AI, an interactive, AI-powered tool for the semi-automated analysis of German sustainability reports. Our transformer-based model achieves promising results both on the well-structured DNK data set and on the real-world GRI data, compared to a number of strong baselines. Qualitative exploration of the results also suggests that it is indeed helpful in analyzing those long documents. The tool is planned to be deployed on an online platform soon and will then be openly accessible to the public.\nFuture work includes improving the current model with additional annotated data, which can easily be inferred from the user feedback we will collect through the tool. We also plan to extend the framework to English reports, as currently only the processing of German documents is possible. Another idea for improvement is to extract specific numeric key performance indicators from the reports, such as different types of CO 2 emissions, water consumption or indicators for social welfare. </p><h2>publication_ref</h2> <p>[] </p><h2>figure_ref</h2> <p>[] </p><h2>table_ref</h2> <p>[] </p><h1>references</h1><h2>ref_id</h2> <p>b0 </p><h2>title</h2> <p>A clustering backed deep learning approach for document layout analysis </p><h2>journal</h2> <p> </p><h2>year</h2> <p>2020 </p><h2>authors</h2> <p>Rhys Agombar; Max Luebbering; Rafet Sifa </p><h2>ref_id</h2> <p>b1 </p><h2>title</h2> <p>A RoBERTa Approach for Automated Processing of Sustainability Reports </p><h2>journal</h2> <p> </p><h2>year</h2> <p>2022 </p><h2>authors</h2> <p>Beyza Merih Angin;  Taşdemir; Arda Cenk; Gökcan Yılmaz; Mert Demiralp; Pelin Atay; Gökhan Angin;  Dikmener </p><h2>ref_id</h2> <p>b2 </p><h2>title\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}}
