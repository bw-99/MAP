The experiment was composed of two sessions. In the first training session, subjects were presented with a tutorial and allowed a trial usage of iQUANT to be tested. In the subsequent formal test session, each subject took seven tasks. To alleviate the influence of financial data on the result and increase statistical power, we presented two stock data. Each subject was required to complete all the tasks with both data using the tested visualization. The full documents of the experiment design are provided in Appendix A. The user tasks can be categorized into four groups.\nQ1/Q2 (factor selection by contribution): Among all the factors, which factors have the highest positive/negative contribution to the return of a particular stock during a given time period? Q3 (factor selection by stability): Among all the factors, which factors have the highest unstable contribution to the return of a particular stock during a given time period? Q4/Q5 (factor selection by contribution to a sector of stocks): Among all the factors, which factors have the highest positive/negative contribution to the return of all stocks in a particular sector during a given time period? Q6/Q7 (stock selection by factor contribution): Among all the stocks in a given sector, whose return receive the highest positive/negative contribution from a selected factor during a given time period?\nFor each question, the subject was required to provide 1 ∼ 2 answers. Because of the between-subject design, subjects were not asked for their subjective rating on each visualization (no within-subject comparison). Instead, we collected their verbal feedback on the pros and cons of each design.<h2>publication_ref</h2>[]<h2>figure_ref</h2>[]<h2>table_ref</h2>[]<h2>heading</h2>Result and Analysis<h2>text</h2>We compute the accuracy of each user's response to a question by comparing them with top-2 answers. The overall accuracy is measured by the number of correct answers to each question. In Figure 4, we depict the accuracy and completion time of four groups of seven questions. Because both accuracy and time do not follow normal distributions, we apply the Mann-Whitney test to analyze.\nOn task accuracy (Figure 4(a)), the result reveals that, for factor selection by contribution (Q1/Q2), by stability (Q3), and stock selection by factor contribution (Q6/Q7), the accuracy of iQUANT is significantly higher than the baseline design: U = 324.0, p = .024 for Q1/Q2; U = 30.0, p = .001 for Q3; U = 207.0, p < .001 for Q6/Q7. The average task accuracies are 1.14±0.14 (iQUANT) and 0.96±0.07 (baseline) for Q1/Q2; 1.29±0.27 (iQUANT) and 0.43±0.3 (baseline) for Q3; 1.36±0.19 (iQUANT) and 0.82±0.15 (baseline) for Q6/Q7. For factor selection in a sector (Q4/Q5), the accuracy difference between the iQUANT and baseline is not significant (U = 364.0, p = .15), though the average accuracy of iQUANT (1.0±0.0) is higher than the baseline (0.93±0.1).\nOn task completion time (Figure 4(b)), the result reveals that, for factor selection by stability (Q3), the completion time using iQUANT is significantly shorter than the baseline design (U = 30.5, p = .002). The average completion times are 27.2s±3.8s (iQUANT) and 50.9s±12.8s (baseline). For factor selection by contribution (Q1/Q2), in a sector of stocks (Q4/Q5), and stock selection by factor contribution (Q6/Q7), the completion time using iQUANT is not significantly shorter than the baseline design: U = 359.0, p = .58 for Q1/Q2; U = 367.0, p = .68 for Q4/Q5; U = 342.0, p = .41 for Q6/Q7. The average completion times are 17.1s±3.4s (iQUANT) and 16.2±3.6s (baseline) for Q1/Q2; 15.9s±3.4s (iQUANT) and 15.9s±4.5s (baseline) for Q4/Q5; 20.4s±3.6s (iQUANT) and 29.3s±9.0s (baseline) for Q6/Q7.\nThe study result indicates that, on most tasks, iQUANT leads to higher task accuracy than the baseline design. The only exception happens on the factor selection task for a sector of stocks (Q4/Q5). It is found that in the stock data used for these two questions, the factor having the highest positive/negative contribution is quite separated from all the other factors. Hence, only the top-1 factor is used as the correct answer, and in both designs, subjects could easily identify this factor (a 100% accuracy for iQUANT). For similarly easy tasks (Q1/Q2 and Q6/Q7), though the baseline design in most case helps to identify one (but only one) top factor, the accuracy of iQUANT is significantly higher because subjects could quickly discover more top factors in comparison to the baseline design.
