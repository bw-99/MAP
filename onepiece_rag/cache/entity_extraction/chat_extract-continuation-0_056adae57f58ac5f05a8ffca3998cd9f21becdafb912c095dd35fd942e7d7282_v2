To capture the transformation from unperturbed to perturbed cell states, the model employs a Hit-and-Run Markov chain sampler. This sampler guarantees a globally optimal solution to generate samples from the target distribution and offers faster convergence than small-step random walks Smith (1996). Second, modeling the PDF of perturbations allows us to identify perturbed genes and predict changes in the expression of other genes following perturbation. Third, sc-OTGM provides a scalable and unified framework for cell state classification, differential gene expression analysis, gene ranking for target identification, perturbation response prediction, and the generation of synthetic scRNA-seq data by sampling from the posteriors of Gaussian components. It offers improved efficiency with reduced runtime and memory requirements compared to LLMs and Variational Autoencoder (VAE) variants, while maintaining competitive accuracy. </p><h2>publication_ref</h2> <p>['b9', 'b0', 'b10', 'b19', 'b23', 'b14', 'b22', 'b29', 'b31', 'b11', 'b20'] </p><h2>figure_ref</h2> <p>[] </p><h2>table_ref</h2> <p>[] </p><h2>heading</h2> <p>RELATED WORK </p><h2>text</h2> <p>Recent advances in single-cell transcriptomics have led to the development of models such as Geneformer Theodoris et al.

However, their effectiveness, particularly in zero-shot learning and in addressing batch effects, is still questioned Kedzierska et al. (2023); Boiarsky et al. (2023). Additionally, there have been significant developments in generative models, including Compositional Perturbation Autoencoder (CPA) Lotfollahi et al. (2021), which uses distinct encoder networks for cell states and perturbations, and further advancements by Lopez et al. (2023) and SAMS-VAE Bereket & Karaletsos (2023), which focus on disentangling representations with causal semantics for perturbation analysis. Tejada-Lapuerta et al. (2023) has criticized these approaches for oversimplifying complex causal relationships.

(2021). These perturbations were executed via CRISPRi, enabling targeted gene knockdown to investigate its effects on neuronal survival and oxidative stress. Using the rank genes groups method from scanpy package Wolf et al. (2018) for differential expression analysis, we scrutinized the effects of knocking down 185 genes identified as potentially relevant to neuronal health and disease states. Of these, only 57 genes met our significance threshold (adjusted p-value less than 0.05), indicating a significant alteration in expression levels post-perturbation. These findings are summarized in Table 2, which includes the genes that presented significant differential expression, highlighting their potential roles in neuronal function and susceptibility to oxidative stress-a key factor in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases.

For each Gaussian component in the mixture model, µ k b ∈ R m and Σ k b ∈ R m×m define the mean and covariance matrix for unperturbed cells of a specific cell type, respectively. We specify perturbations and heterogeneous cellular responses as multivariate Gaussiandistributed variables e ∼ N (µ ke , Σ ke ) and h ∼ N (µ km , Σ km ), respectively. We model perturbation as a dynamic system, where the cell outputs an impulse response function h, when presented with a brief perturbation signal e.
