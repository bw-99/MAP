Furthermore, to realistically evaluate iFixR, we must reorganize the dataset test suites to accurately simulate the context at the time the bug report is submitted by users. </p><h2>publication_ref</h2> <p>['b20', 'b77'] </p><h2>figure_ref</h2> <p>[] </p><h2>table_ref</h2> <p>[] </p><h2>heading</h2> <p>Bug linking. </p><h2>text</h2> <p>To identify the bug report describing a given bug in the Defects4J dataset we focus on recovering the links between the bug fix commits and bug reports from the issue tracking system. Unfortunately, projects Joda-Time, JFreeChart and Closure have migrated their source code repositories and issue tracking systems into GitHub without a proper reassignment of bug report identifiers. Therefore, for these projects, bug IDs referred to in the commit logs are ambiguous (for some bugs this may match with the GitHub issue tracking numbering, while in others, it refers to the original issue tracker). To avoid introducing noise in our validation data, we simply drop these projects. For the remaining projects (Lang and Math), we leverage the bug linking strategies implemented in the Jira issue tracking software. We use a similar approach to Fischer et al. [15] and Thomas et al. [78] to link to commits to corresponding bug reports. Concretely, we crawled the bug reports related to each project and assessed the links with a two-step search strategy: (i)\nwe check commit logs to identify bug report IDs and associate the corresponding changes as bug fix changes; then (ii) we check for bug reports that are indeed considered as such (i.e., tagged as \"BUG\") and are further marked as resolved (i.e., with tags \"RESOLVED\" or \"FIXED\"), and completed (i.e., with status \"CLOSED\"). Eventually, our evaluation dataset includes 156 faults (i.e., De-fects4J bugs). Actually, for the considered projects, Defects4J enumerates 171 bugs associated with 162 bug reports: 15 bugs are indeed left out because either (1) the corresponding bug reports are not in the desired status in the bug tracking system, which may lead to noisy data, or (2) there is ambiguity in the buggy program version (e.g., some fixed files appear to be missing in the repository at the time of bug reporting). </p><h2>publication_ref</h2> <p>['b14', 'b77'] </p><h2>figure_ref</h2> <p>[] </p><h2>table_ref</h2> <p>[] </p><h2>heading</h2> <p>Test suite reorganization. </p><h2>text</h2> <p>We ensure that the benchmark separates past test cases (i.e., regression test cases) from future test cases (i.e., test cases that encode functional requirements specified after the bug is reported). This timeline split is necessary to simulate the snapshot of the repository at the time the bug is reported. As highlighted in Section 2, for over 90% cases of bugs in the De-fects4J benchmark, the test cases relevant to the defective behavior was actually provided along the bug fixing patches. We have thus manually split the commits to identify test cases that should be considered as future test cases for each bug report. </p><h2>publication_ref</h2> <p>[] </p><h2>figure_ref</h2> <p>[] </p><h2>table_ref</h2> <p>[] </p><h2>heading</h2> <p>Implementation Choices </p><h2>text</h2> <p>During implementation, we have made the following parameter choices in the iFixR workflow:\n• IR fault localization considers the top 50 (i.e., k = 50 in Algorithm 1) suspicious files for each bug report, in order to search for buggy code locations. • For patch recommendation experiments, we limit the search space to the top 20 suspected buggy statements yielded by the fine-grained IR-based fault localization. • For comparison experiments, we implement spectrum-based fault localization using the GZoltar testing framework with the Ochiai ranking strategy. Unless otherwise indicated, GZoltar version 0.1.1 is used (as it is widely adopted in the literature, by Astor [59], ACS [92], ssFix [90] and CapGen [84] among others). </p><h2>publication_ref</h2> <p>['b58', 'b91', 'b89', 'b83'] </p><h2>figure_ref</h2> <p>[] </p><h2>table_ref</h2> <p>[] </p><h2>heading</h2> <p>Research Questions </p><h2>text</h2> <p>The assessment objective is to assess the feasibility of automating the generation of patches for user-reported bugs, while investigating the foreseen bottlenecks as well as the research directions that the community must embrace to realize this long-standing endeavor.
