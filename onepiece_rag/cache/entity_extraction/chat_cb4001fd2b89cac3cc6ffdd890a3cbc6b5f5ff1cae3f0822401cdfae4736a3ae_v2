CONCLUSION<h2>text</h2>We investigate random key graph with unreliable links which amounts to the intersection of random key graphs with Erdős-Rényi graphs. We derive zero-one laws for kconnectivity and minimum node degree being at lest k. These zero-one laws are shown to improve the existing results on 1-connectivity of random key graphs with unreliable links as well as k-connectivity of random key graphs.\nAn extension of our work would be to consider a different unreliability model than the independent on/off model used here. One possible candidate is the so-called disk model [29] where two nodes have to be within a certain distance to each other to have a link in between; this induces a random geometric graph. Intersection of random key graphs with random geometric graphs has already received some interest [22], [25], but the model is proven to be difficult to analyze with results obtained thus far for its connectivity [23], [24], [43], not for k-connectivity.\nit is clear that the number of possible instances for realizing the event F is given by\nn -2 m 1 • n -m 1 -2 m 2 • n -m 1 -m 2 -2 m 3 .(206)\nThe event J defined below is an instance of F . (212) upon using exchangeability.\nFor any constants m 1 , m 2 and m 3 , we have\nn -2 m 1 n -m 1 -2 m 2 n -m 1 -m 2 -2 m 3 ∼ n m1 m 1 ! • n m2 m 2 ! • n m3 m 3 ! = n m1+m2+m3 m 1 !m 2 !m 3 ! . (213\n)\nNow, we evaluate the probability\n{P[E xj∩yj | (|S xy | = u)]} n-m1-m2-m3-2 . (214\n)\nIt is clear that \nApplying ( 213) and ( 220) into (212), we obtain (77) and this establishes Lemma 4.<h2>publication_ref</h2>['b28', 'b21', 'b24', 'b22', 'b23', 'b42']<h2>figure_ref</h2>[]<h2>table_ref</h2>[]<h2>heading</h2>APPENDIX A ADDITIONAL FACTS AND LEMMAS<h2>text</h2><h2>publication_ref</h2>[]<h2>figure_ref</h2>[]<h2>table_ref</h2>[]<h2>heading</h2>A.
