After that, a readout layer is applied to the embeddings for either a node classification or link prediction task.

ORC seeks the most efficient transportation plan that preserves mass between two probability measures, which may be solved using linear programming. Intuitively, transporting messages between two nodes whose neighbors are highly overlapping, such as two nodes in the same cluster, is costless. On the other hand, if two nodes are situated in distinct groups or clusters, information flow between them is difficult.<h2>publication_ref</h2>['b20', 'b57', 'b32', 'b57', 'b1', 'b75']<h2>figure_ref</h2>[]<h2>table_ref</h2>[]<h2>heading</h2>METHODOLOGY<h2>text</h2>The proposed method, 𝜅HGCN, combines discrete and continuous curvatures to improve tree-like modeling in hyperbolic space. Our approach emphasizes the strengthening of message passing in nodes with high local graph curvature and the weakening of message propagation in nodes with low local curvature. This curvatureguided approach enhances the formation of hierarchies and reduces the impact of structural incompatibility on the modeling process.<h2>publication_ref</h2>[]<h2>figure_ref</h2>[]<h2>table_ref</h2>[]<h2>heading</h2>𝜅HGCN<h2>text</h2>Our approach, named 𝜅HGCN, presents a novel curvature-aware hyperbolic graph network model, as depicted in Figure 3. Building upon the foundation of HGCN [11], we implement graph convolution operations via the tangential method [11,45] space. However, it is worth mentioning that 𝜅HGCN is flexible and can be applied to non-tangential methods as well [97]. Similar to other GNN and HGNN models, 𝜅HGCN also comprises three fundamental modules: hyperbolic feature transformation, curvature-aware neighbor aggregation, and non-linear activation.<h2>publication_ref</h2>['b10', 'b10', 'b44', 'b96']<h2>figure_ref</h2>[]<h2>table_ref</h2>[]<h2>heading</h2>Hyperbolic Feature Transformation.
