We first calculate\nP [B h | (|S xy | = u)]. Given the definition of B h in (107), we let m 1 = h and m 2 = m 3 = ℓ -h -1 in Lemma 4 to obtain P [B h | (|S xy | = u)] ∼ n 2ℓ-h-2 h![(ℓ -h -1)!] 2 • e -2pen+ pepnu Kn n × {P[E xj∩yj | (|S xy | = u)]} h × {P[E xj∩yj | (|S xy | = u)]} ℓ-h-1 × {P[E xj∩yj | (|S xy | = u)]} ℓ-h-1 . (114\n)\nSubstituting ( 90), ( 91) and ( 92) into (114), we obtain\nP [B h | (|S xy | = u)] ≤ 2e -2pen+ pepnnu Kn (p e n) 2ℓ-h-2 .\n(115) for all n sufficiently large.\nReturning to the evaluation of the R.H.S. of (113), we apply (115) to ( 113) and obtain for all n sufficiently large,\nℓ-1 h=0 P [B h ∩ E xy ] ≤ Kn u=1 P[|S xy | = u] • 2e -2pen+ pn u Kn •pen • ℓ h=0 (p e n) 2ℓ-h-2 = (p e n) -2 × R.H.S. of (94). (116\n)\nFrom p e n = Ω(1), it follows that\nℓ-1 h=0 P [B h ∩ E xy ] = O (R.H.S. of (94)) .(117)\nGiven ( 95) and (117), we obtain (110) and this completes the proof of Proposition 2.\nHaving established Propositions 1 and 2, we prove Lemma 3, and the zero-law (11) follows as explained in Section VI. </p><h2>publication_ref</h2> <p>['b10'] </p><h2>figure_ref</h2> <p>[] </p><h2>table_ref</h2> <p>[] </p><h2>heading</h2> <p>IX. ESTABLISHING (12) (THE ONE-LAW </p><h2>text</h2> <p>FOR k-CONNECTIVITY IN G on )\nAs shown in Section V-B, we can enforce the extra condition α n = o(ln n) in establishing (12) (i.e., the one-law for kconnectivity in G on ). Therefore, we will establish (12) under the following conditions: (9), K n ≥ 2 for all n sufficiently large , P n = Ω(n), (118)\nK n P n = o(1), lim n→∞ α n = +∞ and α n = o(ln n).(119)\nIn graph G on , consider scalings K, P : N 0 → N 0 and p : N 0 → (0, 1) as in Theorem 1. We find it useful to define a sequence β ℓ,n : N × N 0 → R through the relation\np e = ln n + ℓ ln ln n + β ℓ,n n(120)\nfor each n ∈ N 0 and each ℓ ∈ N. (120) follows by just setting\nβ ℓ,n := np e -ln n -ℓ ln ln n. (121\n)\nThe one-law (12) will follow from the next key result. Recall that, as defined in Section V-D, κ is the connectivity of the graph G on , namely the minimum number nodes whose deletion makes it disconnected.\nLemma 5. Let ℓ be a non-negative constant integer. If K n ≥ 2 for any sufficiently large n, P n = Ω(n), Kn Pn = o(1), and (120) holds with β ℓ,n = o(ln n) and lim n→∞ β ℓ,n = +∞, then\nlim n→∞ P [κ = ℓ] = 0. (122\n)\nWe now explain why the one-law (12) follows from Lemma 5. Consider p n , K n and P n such that (118) and (119) hold. Comparing ( 9) and (120), we get\nβ ℓ,n = (k -1 -ℓ) ln ln n + α n .
