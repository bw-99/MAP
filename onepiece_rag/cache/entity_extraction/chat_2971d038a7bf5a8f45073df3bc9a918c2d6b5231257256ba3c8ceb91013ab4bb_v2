That is, each task τ i is specified only by its utilization U i . An instance of task τ i can have different worst-case execution times and different relative deadlines. If an instance of task τ i arrives at time t with execution time C i,t , its relative deadline is Ci,t Ui , and the next instance of task τ i can only be released after t + Ci,t Ui .\nFor systems with known modes, we can also define a multi-mode task system. A multi-mode task τ i with m i modes is denoted by a set of triplet:\nto specify the worst-case execution time C i,j , the minimum inter-arrival time T i,j , and the relative deadline D i,j of the corresponding task mode τ i,j . For a multi-mode task τ i , when a job of mode τ i,j is released at time t, this job has to be finished no later than its absolute deadline at time t + D i,j , and the next release time of task τ i is no earlier than t + T i,j . We only consider systems with constrained deadlines, in which D i,j ≤ T i,j . This model is studied in our paper [31]. The difference between this model and the generalized multi-frame model is that the system can switch arbitrarily among any two modes if the temporal seperation constraints in the multi-mode model are respected.\nWe will focus on mode-level fixed-priority scheduling on uniprocessor scheduling in this section. Suppose that we are testing whether task τ k,h can be feasibly scheduled. Let hp(τ k,h ) be the set of task mode τ k,h and the other task modes with higher priority than task mode τ k,h . It is important to note that τ k,h is also in hp(τ k,h ) for the simplicity of presentation. For notational brevity, we assume that there are k -1 tasks with higher-priority task modes than τ k,h . Moreover, for the rest of this section, we implicitly assume that the tasks in hp(τ k,h ) \\ {τ k,h } are schedulable by the mode-level fixedpriority scheduling algorithm under testing.\nLet load(i, t) be the maximum workload of task τ i (by considering all the task modes τ i,j ∈ hp(τ k,h )) released from 0 to t such that the next mode can be released at time t. That is, let n i,q be a non-negative integer to denote the number of times that task mode τ i,q is released, in which\nq n i,q T i,q ≤ t}.\nWe denote C max i (τ k,h ) the maximum mode execution time among the higher-priority modes of task τ i than task mode τ k,h , i.e., max τi,j ∈hp(τ k,h ) C i,j for a given index i. Similarly, we denote U max i (τ k,h ) the maximum mode utilization among the higher-priority modes of task τ i than task mode τ k,h , i.e., max τi,j ∈hp(τ k,h ) Ci,j Ti,j for a given index i. For notational brevity, since we define C max i (τ k,h ) and U max i (τ k,h ) by referring to τ k,h , we will simplify the notation by using C max i and U max i , respectively, for the rest of this section.\nSuppose that the last release of task τ i in the window of interest is at t i . We define the request bound function for such a case as follows:\nLemma 14. Task τ k,h in a multi-mode task system with constrained deadlines is schedulable by a mode-level fixed-priority scheduling algorithm on uniprocessor systems if\nProof: This is proved by contrapositive. Suppose that τ k,h misses its deadline firstly at time d k,h . We know that this job of τ k,h arrives to the system at time a 1 = d k,h -D k,h . Due to the scheduling policy, we know that the processor is busy executing jobs in hp(τ k,h ) (recall that τ k,h is also in hp(τ k,h )) from a 1 to d k,h . Let a 0 be the last time point in the above schedule before a 1 such that the processor is idle or executing any job with lower priority than τ k,h . It is clear that a 0 is well-defined. Therefore, the processor executes only jobs in hp(τ k,h ) from a 0 to d k,h . We denote a 1 -a 0 as y. Let the last release of the task modes of task τ i before d k,h be a 0 + t i . If task τ i does not have any release, we set t i to 0. Therefore, we have 0\nWithout loss of generality, we set a 0 to 0. Therefore, the workload requested by the modes of task τ i at any time t before (and at)\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}}
