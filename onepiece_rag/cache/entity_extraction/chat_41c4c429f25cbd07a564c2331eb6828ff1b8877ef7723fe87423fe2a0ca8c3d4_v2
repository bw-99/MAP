MAE and RMSE results of rating prediction over Movielens 100K dataset are shown in Table 1. Di erences are very small to LibRec, showing that pyRecLab can reproduce results of a mature recommender library. Time Performance. Although the results vary depending on the method, Figure 2 shows train/test performance using FunkSVD. While both libraries perform similarly in training phase, pyRecLab performs faster in testing time at di erent number of latent factors.\nSummarizing, we have introduced PyRecLab, a library for recommender systems which combines the performance of C++ in its implementation with the versatility of Python for easy-of-use. We expect to add algorithms and recommendations metrics, as well as new code samples to facilitate its widespread adoption.<h2>publication_ref</h2>['b3']<h2>figure_ref</h2>[]<h2>table_ref</h2>['tab_1']<h1>references</h1><h2>ref_id</h2>b0<h2>title</h2>rrecsys: an R-package for prototyping recommendation algorithms<h2>journal</h2><h2>year</h2>2016<h2>authors</h2>C Ludovik; Markus Zanker<h2>ref_id</h2>b1<h2>title</h2>LensKit: a modular recommender framework<h2>journal</h2>ACM<h2>year</h2>2011<h2>authors</h2>Michael Michael D Ekstrand; Jack Ludwig; John T Kolb;  Riedl<h2>ref_id</h2>b2<h2>title</h2>MyMediaLite: A free recommender system library<h2>journal</h2>ACM<h2>year</h2>2011<h2>authors</h2>Zeno Gantner; Christoph Ste En Rendle; Lars Freudenthaler;  Schmidtieme<h2>ref_id</h2>b3<h2>title</h2>LibRec: A Java Library for Recommender Systems<h2>journal</h2><h2>year</h2>2015<h2>authors</h2>Guibing Guo; Jie Zhang; Zhu Sun; Neil Yorke-Smith<h2>ref_id</h2>b4<h2>title</h2>Python is now the most popular introductory teaching language at top us universities<h2>journal</h2>BLOG@ CACM<h2>year</h2>2014-07<h2>authors</h2>Philip Guo<h2>ref_id</h2>b5<h2>title</h2>Metadata Embeddings for User and Item Cold-start Recommendations<h2>journal</h2><h2>year</h2>2015<h2>authors</h2>Maciej Kula<h2>ref_id</h2>b6<h2>title</h2>Recommender systems: Sources of knowledge and evaluation metrics<h2>journal</h2>Springer<h2>year</h2>2013<h2>authors</h2>Denis Parra; Shaghayegh Sahebi<h1>figures</h1><h2>figure_label</h2>1<h2>figure_type</h2>figure<h2>figure_id</h2>fig_0<h2>figure_caption</h2>Figure 1 :1Figure 1: pyRecLab architecture.<h2>figure_data</h2><h2>figure_label</h2>12<h2>figure_type</h2>figure<h2>figure_id</h2>fig_1<h2>figure_caption</h2>Figure 1 ,Figure 2 :12Figure 1, shows the main modules of pyRecLab.
