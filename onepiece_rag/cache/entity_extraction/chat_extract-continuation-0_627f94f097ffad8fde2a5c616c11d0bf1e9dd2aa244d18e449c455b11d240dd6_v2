We then sampled users that follow these content producer accounts. All users are anonymized with no other personally identifiable information (e.g., demographic features) present. Additionally, the timestamp of each follow edge was mapped to an integer that respects date ordering, but does not provide any information about the date that follow occurred. In total, we have 261M edges and 15.5M vertices, with a max-degree of 900K and a min-degree of 5. We hope that this dataset will be of useful to the community as a test-bed for large-scale retrieval research. </p><h2>publication_ref</h2> <p>['b23'] </p><h2>figure_ref</h2> <p>[] </p><h2>table_ref</h2> <p>[] </p><h2>heading</h2> <p>Metrics: </p><h2>text</h2> <p>We evaluate kNN-Embed on three aspects: (1) the recall (2) diversity and (3) goodness of fit of retrieved candidates. Below, we formalize these metrics. </p><h2>publication_ref</h2> <p>[] </p><h2>figure_ref</h2> <p>[] </p><h2>table_ref</h2> <p>[] </p><h2>heading</h2> <p>Recall@K: </p><h2>text</h2> <p>The most natural (and perhaps most important) metric for computing the efficacy of various candidate retrieval strategies is Recall@K. This metric is given by considering a fixed number of top candidates yield by a retrieval system (up to size K) and measuring what percent of these candidates are heldout relevant candidates. The purpose of most candidate retrieval systems is to collect a high-recall pool of items for further ranking, and thus recall is a relevant metric to consider. Additionally, recall provides an indirect way to measure diversity -to achieve high recall, one is obliged to return a large fraction of all relevant documents, which simple greedy ANN searches can struggle with. </p><h2>publication_ref</h2> <p>[] </p><h2>figure_ref</h2> <p>[] </p><h2>table_ref</h2> <p>[] </p><h2>heading</h2> <p>Diversity: </p><h2>text</h2> <p>To evaluate the diversity among the retrieved candidates, we measure the spread in the embeddings of the retrieved candidates by calculating the average distance retrieved candidates are from their centroid. The underlying idea is that when 'locality implies similarity'; as a corollary, if candidates are further in Euclidean distance, then they are likely to be different. As such, for a given set of candidates C, we compute diversity D as follows:\nD(C) = 1 |C| i k ∈C ∥i k -î∥(8)\nwhere C denotes the set of retrieved candidates and î = i k ∈C i k /|C| is the mean of the unimodal embeddings of the retrieved candidates. </p><h2>publication_ref</h2> <p>[] </p><h2>figure_ref</h2> <p>[] </p><h2>table_ref</h2> <p>[] </p><h2>heading</h2> <p>Goodness of Fit: </p><h2>text</h2> <p>In addition to diversity of\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>HEP-TH CITATION GRAPH<|>CONCEPT<|>The HEP-TH Citation Graph is a citation network collected from Arxiv preprints in the High Energy Physics category, consisting of 34,546 papers and 421,578 citations.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DBLP CITATION GRAPH<|>CONCEPT<|>The DBLP Citation Graph is a citation network collected from DBLP, consisting of 5,354,309 papers and 48,227,950 citation relationships.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>TWITTER FOLLOW GRAPH<|>CONCEPT<|>The Twitter Follow Graph is a dataset of user-follow relationships on Twitter, consisting of 261 million edges and 15.5 million vertices, used for large-scale retrieval research.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>RECALL@K<|>CONCEPT<|>Recall@K is a metric used to evaluate the efficacy of candidate retrieval strategies by measuring the percentage of relevant candidates retrieved from a fixed number of top candidates.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DIVERSITY<|>CONCEPT<|>Diversity is a metric that measures the spread in the embeddings of retrieved candidates, indicating how different the candidates are from each other.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GOODNESS OF FIT<|>CONCEPT<|>Goodness of Fit is a metric used to evaluate how well the retrieved candidates fit the expected distribution or characteristics of relevant items.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>HEP-TH CITATION GRAPH<|>DBLP CITATION GRAPH<|>Both citation graphs are networks that represent academic papers and their citation relationships in different domains<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>TWITTER FOLLOW GRAPH<|>HEP-TH CITATION GRAPH<|>The Twitter Follow Graph and HEP-TH Citation Graph are both datasets used for research purposes, although in different contexts<|>3)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>TWITTER FOLLOW GRAPH<|>DBLP CITATION GRAPH<|>The Twitter Follow Graph and DBLP Citation Graph are both datasets used for research purposes, although in different contexts<|>3)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>RECALL@K<|>GOODNESS OF FIT<|>Recall@K and Goodness of Fit are both metrics used to evaluate the performance of retrieval systems<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>DIVERSITY<|>GOODNESS OF FIT<|>Diversity and Goodness of Fit are both metrics that assess different aspects of candidate retrieval effectiveness<|>6)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
