The arrows indicate the aggregation flow and the values on the edges represent the edge curvature, denoted as 𝜅 1 for 𝑇 1 and 𝜅 2 for 𝑇 2 . By incorporating curvature 𝜅 into the neighboring aggregation, the detection of local structures is improved. This is achieved by assigning asymmetric weights (𝜅1 𝑎,𝑜 vs 𝜅 1 𝑎,𝑏 ) to nodes at different levels and results in larger values for nodes in a circular shape (𝜅 1 𝑎,𝑜 vs 𝜅 2 𝑎,𝑜 and 𝜅 1 𝑎,𝑐 vs 𝜅 2 𝑎,𝑐 ). </p><h2>figure_data</h2> <p> </p><h2>figure_label</h2> <p>124 </p><h2>figure_type</h2> <p>figure </p><h2>figure_id</h2> <p>fig_2 </p><h2>figure_caption</h2> <p>4. 1 . 2 Figure 4 :124Figure 4: Illustration of the proposed Curvature-aware aggregation.
