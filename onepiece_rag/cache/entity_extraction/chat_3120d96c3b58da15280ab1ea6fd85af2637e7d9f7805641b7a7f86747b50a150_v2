These factors are initially recommended by sparse models in iQUANT (T1). The model measures the importance of each factor by its weight, value, or contribution to the prediction of stock returns. By default, traders first look at the contribution measure which covers both its current value and the overall weight. The contribution can be either positive or negative depending on the relationship between the factor and stock returns. According to our expert study, they also consider several other metrics in the factor evaluation and selection process, including the temporal stability of factors and their sensitivity in the model.
