CONCLUSION AND DISCUSSION<h2>text</h2>Session-based item recommendation systems have gained many innovations by incorporating deep learning models for variety of applications. Session-based systems can give a precise set of recommendations based on a user's current session activity and their past preferences. In this work we proposed such a model to recommend a set of ragam(music scale in Indian classical music) to perform in a concert, given a set of preferred ragams. Particularly, we proposed a networkbased deep learning approach to utilize both hand picked features and structural features of ragam sequences in concerts for the recommendation task. With the experiments, we show that our model can outperform state-of-the-art methods in recommending songs for Indian classical music concerts.\nAlthough this is the first step to merge recommender system with classical music concerts, the model can be extended in several ways in the future: 1. Even though a ragam is an integral part of a song, adding the composer and composition level features to recommend songs benefit and save time for musicians to arrange the concert, 2. Generalize the architecture to support multiple forms of classical music like Western classical music, and 3. Such an extensive model can be adopted in music streaming services like Pandora and Spotify to match the listener preference in the classical music.<h2>publication_ref</h2>[]<h2>figure_ref</h2>[]<h2>table_ref</h2>[]<h1>references</h1><h2>ref_id</h2>b0<h2>title</h2>Hierarchical temporal convolutional networks for dynamic recommender systems<h2>journal</h2>ser.
