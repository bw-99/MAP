A proof of Corollary 1 </p><h2>text</h2> <p>Consider p n , K n and P n as in the statement of Corollary 1 such that (15) holds. As explained above, conditions Kn Pn = o(1) and\nK 2 n Pn = o(1) both hold.\nThe proof is based on Theorem 1. Namely, we will show that if the sequence α ′ : N 0 → R is defined such that\np e = ln n + (k -1) ln ln n + α ′ n n(25)\nfor any n ∈ N 0 , then it holds that\nα ′ n = α n ± O(1)(26)\nunder the enforced assumptions. In view of lim n→∞ (ln n + (k -1) ln ln n+ α n ) = ∞ and (26), we get lim n→∞ p e n = ∞ from (25). Thus, for any ǫ > 0, we have p e n > ǫ for all n sufficiently large. Hence, all the conditions enforced by Theorem 1 are met, and under ( 25) and ( 26), Corollary 1 follows from Theorem 1 since\nlim n→∞ α ′ n = ±∞ if lim n→∞ α n = ±∞.\nWe now establish (26). First, as seen by the analysis given in Section V-B below, we can introduce the extra condition α n = o(ln n) in proving part (b) of Corollary 1; i.e., in proving the one-law under the condition lim n→∞ α n = ∞. This yields (15). Also, in the case lim n→∞ α n = -∞, we have α n < 0 for all n sufficiently large so that\np n K 2 n Pn = O( ln n n ) under\np n K 2 n Pn = O( ln n n )\n. Now, in order to establish (26), we observe from part (a) of Lemma 8foot_1 that\np s = K 2 n P n ± O K 4 n P 2 n .(27)\nThen, from (27) and the fact that p e = p s p n , we get\np e = p n • K 2 n P n ± p n • K 2 n P n • O K 2 n P n .(28)\nSubstituting (15),\np n K 2 n Pn = O( ln n n ) and K 2 n Pn = O 1 ln n into (28), we find p e = ln n + (k -1) ln ln n + α n ± O(1) n . (29\n)\nComparing the above relation with (25), the desired conclusion (26) follows. </p><h2>publication_ref</h2> <p>['b24', 'b25', 'b14', 'b25', 'b26', 'b14', 'b24'] </p><h2>figure_ref</h2> <p>[] </p><h2>table_ref</h2> <p>[] </p><h2>heading</h2> <p>G. A proof of Corollary 2 </p><h2>text</h2> <p>We first establish the zero-law. Pick K n , P n such that (20) holds with lim n→∞ α n = -∞. It is clear that we have α n < 0 for all n sufficiently large so that\nK 2 n Pn = O( ln n n ) = o(1)\n. In view of ( 27) we thus get\np s = ln n + (k -1) ln ln n + α n ± o(1) n , n = 1, 2, . . . Let p n = 1 for all n. In this case, graph G on becomes equivalent to G(n, K n , P n ) with p e = ln n + (k -1) ln ln n + α n ± o(1) n , n = 1, 2, . . .(30)\nFrom ( 30) and ( 20), we have p e n = n\nK 2 n Pn ± o(1) so that i) if there exists an ǫ > 0 such that n K 2 n\nPn > ǫ, then there exists an ǫ ′ > 0 such that p e n > ǫ ′ for all n sufficiently large and ii) if lim n→∞ n K 2 n Pn = 0, then lim n→∞ p e n = 0. Thus, all the conditions enforced by part (a) of Theorem 1 are satisfied for the given K n , P n and p n . Comparing (30) with (9), we get lim n→∞ α n ± o(1) = -∞ and the zero law\nlim n→∞ P [G(n, K n , P n ) is k-connected ] = 0 follows from (10) of Theorem 1.\nWe now establish the one-law.
