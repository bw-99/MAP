A PROOF OF PROPOSITION 4 </p><h2>text</h2> <p>We start by introducing some notation. For any non-empty subset U of nodes, i.e., U ⊆ v 1 , . . . , v n , we define the graph G on (U ) (with vertex set U ) as the subgraph of G on restricted to the nodes in U . If all nodes in U are deleted from G on , the remaining graph is given by G on (U c ) on the vertices U c = v 1 , . . . , v n  \\ U . Let N U c denote the collection of all nonempty subsets of v 1 , . . . , v n  \\ U . We say that a subset T in N U c is isolated in G on (U c ) if there are no edges (in G on ) between the nodes in T and the nodes in U c \\ T . This is characterized by\nE ij , v i ∈ T, v j ∈ U c \\ T.\nWith each non-empty subset T ⊆ U c of nodes, we associate several events of interest: Let C T denote the event that the subgraph G on (T ) is itself connected. The event C T is completely determined by the random variables (rvs) S i , v i ∈ T  and C ij , v i , v j ∈ T . We also introduce the event D U,T to capture the fact that T is isolated in G on (U c ), i.e., D U,T :=\nvi∈T vj ∈U c \\T E ij .\nFinally, we let B U,T denote the event that each node in U has an edge with at least one node in T , i.e., B U,T :=\nvi∈U vj ∈T E ij .\nWe also set\nA U,T := B U,T ∩ C T ∩ D U,T .\nThe proof starts with the following observations: In graph G on , if the connectivity is ℓ (i.e., κ = ℓ) and yet each node has degree at least ℓ + 1 (i.e., δ > ℓ), then there must exist subsets U , T of nodes with\nU ∈ N , |U | = ℓ and T ∈ N U c , |T | ≥ 2, such that G on (T ) is connected while T is isolated in G on (U c\n). This ensures that G on can be disconnected by deleting an appropriately selected set of ℓ nodes; i..e, nodes in U . Notice that, this would not be possible for sets T in N U c with |T | = 1, since the degree of a node in T is at least ℓ+1 by virtue of the event δ > ℓ; this ensures that a single node in T is connected to at least one node in U c \\ T . Moreover, the event κ = ℓ also enforces G on to remain connected after the deletion of any ℓ -1 nodes. Therefore, if there exists a subset U (with |U | = ℓ) such that some T in N U c is isolated in G on (U c ), then each of the ℓ nodes in U should be connected to at least one node in T and to at least one node in U c \\ T . This can easily be seen by contradiction: Consider subsets U ∈ N with |U | = ℓ, and T ∈ N U c with |T | ≥ 2, such that there exists no edge between the nodes in T and the nodes in U c \\ T . Suppose there exists a node v i in U such that v i is connected to at least one node in U c \\ T but is not connected to any node in T . Then, G on can be disconnected by deleting the nodes in U \\ v i  since there will be no edge between the nodes in T and the nodes in v i  ∪ U c \\ T . But, |U \\ v i | = ℓ -1, and this contradicts the fact that κ = ℓ.\nThe inclusion\n[(κ = ℓ) ∩ (δ > ℓ)] ⊆ U∈N n,ℓ , T ∈N U c : |T |≥2 A U,T\nis now immediate with N n,r denoting the collection of all subsets of v 1 , . . . , v n  with exactly r elements. It is also easy to check that this union need only be taken over all subsets T of v 1 , . . . , v n  with 2 ≤ |T | ≤ ⌊ n-ℓ 2 ⌋. We now use a standard union bound argument to obtain\nP (κ = ℓ) ∩ (δ > ℓ) ∩ E(J ) ≤ U∈N n,ℓ ,T ∈N U c : 2≤|T |≤⌊ n-ℓ 2 ⌋ P A U,T ∩ E(J ) = ⌊ n-ℓ 2 ⌋ r=2 U∈N n,ℓ ,T ∈N U c ,r P A U,T ∩ E(J )(147)\nwith N U c ,r denoting the collection of all subsets of U c with exactly r elements.\nFor each r = 1, . . . , nℓ -1, we simplify the notation by writing A ℓ,r := A v1,...,v ℓ\n######################\noutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>GRAPH G<|>CONCEPT<|>Graph G is a mathematical structure consisting of a set of vertices and edges, used to represent pairwise relationships between objects in the context of the proof of Proposition 4.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SUBGRAPH<|>CONCEPT<|>A subgraph is a graph formed from a subset of the vertices and edges of a larger graph, specifically in this context, the graph G restricted to a subset of nodes U.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ISOLATED SUBSET<|>CONCEPT<|>An isolated subset in a graph is a collection of nodes that has no edges connecting it to other nodes outside the subset, indicating a lack of connectivity in the larger graph.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>EVENT C T<|>CONCEPT<|>Event C T denotes the occurrence of the subgraph G on (T) being connected, which is determined by the random variables associated with the nodes in T.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>EVENT D U,T<|>CONCEPT<|>Event D U,T captures the condition that the subset T is isolated in the graph G on (U c), meaning there are no edges between nodes in T and nodes in U c \\ T.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>EVENT B U,T<|>CONCEPT<|>Event B U,T indicates that each node in U has at least one edge connecting it to a node in T, ensuring some level of connectivity between these subsets.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>EVENT A U,T<|>CONCEPT<|>Event A U,T is the intersection of events B U,T, C T, and D U,T, representing a specific condition of connectivity and isolation in the graph.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CONNECTIVITY κ<|>CONCEPT<|>Connectivity κ is a measure of the minimum number of nodes that need to be removed to disconnect the remaining nodes in the graph G, indicating its robustness.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DEGREE δ<|>CONCEPT<|>Degree δ refers to the minimum number of edges connected to a node in the graph, which influences the graph's connectivity and structure.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SUBGRAPH<|>GRAPH G<|>The subgraph is derived from the graph G, focusing on a specific subset of nodes, thus maintaining the relationships defined in G.<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ISOLATED SUBSET<|>GRAPH G<|>An isolated subset is defined in relation to the graph G, indicating a lack of edges connecting it to the rest of the graph.<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>EVENT C T<|>EVENT A U,T<|>Event C T is one of the conditions that must be satisfied for event A U,T to occur, indicating a relationship between connectivity and isolation.<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>EVENT D U,T<|>EVENT A U,T<|>Event D U,T is another condition that must be satisfied for event A U,T, linking isolation to the overall event structure.<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>EVENT B U,T<|>EVENT A U,T<|>Event B U,T is also a necessary condition for event A U,T, showing the interconnectedness of these events in the graph.<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CONNECTIVITY κ<|>DEGREE δ<|>The connectivity κ is influenced by the degree δ, as a higher degree generally implies better connectivity in the graph.<|>8)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
