However, in their model design, AGTM does not directly train user embeddings. Instead, the user is modeled using an aspect attentive network. As a consequence, the user embedding does not undergo direct training during the backward propagation of the model, resulting in information loss and a deficiency in learning representations. Lastly, printf model consistently achieves exceptional performance across all datasets, providing strong evidence for the effectiveness of our model design. The observed improvements are statistically significant, with all ùëù-values being less than 0.01. These improvements can be attributed to three key factors:\n‚Ä¢ The cross-modality feature alignment encoder in CMIM enables us to extract more potent and robust image and text features with global semantics. ‚Ä¢ Using dimension-based attention via extracted review representations for user embeddings enables us to effectively determine the prominence relationship between user preferences and item contents. Moreover, the user embeddings are directly trained during the EPIM stage to avoid information loss. ‚Ä¢ The bipartite graph structure in EPIM allows printf model to successfully distill higher-order relationships and precisely model user preferences.<h2>publication_ref</h2>[]<h2>figure_ref</h2>[]<h2>table_ref</h2>[]<h2>heading</h2>Ablation Study<h2>text</h2>In our printf model, we have incorporated two crucial components: CMIM and RAUM. We aim to demonstrate the effectiveness of each component individually; a comprehensive ablation study experiment is conducted. The results presented in Table 3 showcase the performance of our model when each component is excluded, allowing us to evaluate the impact and efficiency of CMIM and RAUM in isolation. The constructed variants are as follows: Based on Table 3, it's evident that every component of our model design contributes positively to the recommendation. Removing any of these components would result in a performance decrease. Our experimental findings provide validation for the effectiveness of our design, proving that incorporating both image and textual contents as initial item embeddings is a great starting point. This integration allows CMIM to proficiently capture and align the meaning of item images and titles, enhancing item representation. It's worth noting that eliminating either textual content or image content leads to a significant decline in performance, underscoring the importance of modeling both modalities. Additionally, RAUM excels in capturing user preferences. Removing this component results in a substantial drop in performance, indicating the dimension-based attention in RAUM to differentiate the significance of interacted items is an excellent approach for user preference modeling. To conclude, all of the components play a crucial role in printf. Note that in our ablation test, we did not include the variant of removing Amazon-Grocery Amazon-Tools Amazon-Electronics R@5 N@5 R@10 N@10 R@5 N@5 R@10 N@10 R@5 N@5 R@10 N@10 \n‚Ä¢ w/o CMIM (<h2>publication_ref</h2>[]<h2>figure_ref</h2>[]<h2>table_ref</h2>['tab_2', 'tab_2']<h2>heading</h2>Analysis and Discussions<h2>text</h2>4.5.1 The Effect of GCN Layers. We investigate the impact of varying the number of graph convolution layers on the performance of our model. The comprehensive experimental results can be found in Figure 2. The model performance generally improves as the number of layers is increased from 1 to 7, except for the metrics@5 on Tools and Electronics, which perform better with 5 gcn layers. In most cases, the printf model with 7 GCN layers demonstrates competitive and satisfactory results. This finding highlights that our proposed model requires a higher number of GCN layers compared to other GCN-based models, such as LightGCN [12] and AGTM [14], which typically employ 3 GCN layers. The need for more layers in printf may be attributed to the sparsity and diversity of textual and image features, necessitating additional layers to effectively extract user preferences and capture high-order connectivity. However, it's important to note that excessive propagation, i.e., an excessive number of GCN layers such as 8 or 9, can result in the over-smoothing of information and have a negative impact on predictions.  this leads to negative effects and instead creates noise that interferes with the originally generated representation, since the image embedding we obtained did not participate in the training of the recommendation task. Therefore, we design a method that uses the item image representation and user image representation we just get, as the initial embedding of BPRMF, and conducts model training with the current recommendation task, then takes the user and item embeddings which have been fully trained. We concatenate the embeddings individually behind the user and item representation to predict the top-N items, and compare the performance. From the Table 4, all the above models have positive effects when image contents are taken into consideration.<h2>publication_ref</h2>['b11', 'b13']<h2>figure_ref</h2>[]<h2>table_ref</h2>[]<h2>heading</h2>Dimension-Based Attention in RAUM.<h2>text</h2>Here we would like to validate and evaluate the assumptions and designs we made in RAUM. The assumption posits that each dimension in the representation corresponds to specific topics and aspects that can be easily differentiated. To investigate this hypothesis, we leveraged the attention scores calculated for each dimension to observe if such a phenomenon exists as shown in Figure 3, in which we identified the top frequently attended words for each dimension. It conclusively demonstrated that indeed, each dimension possessed words that were distinctly associated with it, as evident through their diagonal co-cluster effect. Furthermore, these words encompassed diverse types and themes.
