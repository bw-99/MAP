The UUniFast-Discard method [23] was adopted to generate a set of utilization values with the given goal. We used the approach suggested by Davis et al. [25] to generate the task periods according to a uniform distribution in the range of the logarithm of the task periods (i.e., log-uniform distribution). The order of magnitude p to control the period values between the largest and smallest periods is parameterized in evaluations, (e.g., 1 -10ms for p = 1, 1 -100ms for p = 2, etc.). We evaluate these tests in uniprocessor systems with p ∈ [1,2,3]. The execution time was set accordingly, i.e., C i = T i U i . Tasks' relative deadlines were equal to their periods.\nThe evaluated tests for n tasks in T with n ≥ M are:\n• BCL: the linear-time test in Theorem 4 in [11].\n• FF: the pseudo-polynomial-time forced-forward (FF) analysis in Eq. ( 5) in [7]. • BAK: the O(n 3 ) test in Theorem 11 in [5].\n• Guan: the pseudo-polynomial-time response time analysis [29]. 34) in Theorem 5. This requires to sort the higher-priority tasks to define the proper last release ordering and the M -1 carry-in jobs; therefore, the time complexity is O(n 2 log n) for a task set with n tasks. • QB-BC2 (from k 2 Q): Eq. ( 34) in Theorem 6 by always using the worst-case release time ordering, which is the reverse order of the given priority assignment. The schedulability test can be implemented in O(n log M ) time complexity by using proper data structures, provided that the RM priority order is given. 6   Figure 2 depicts the result of the performance comparison. In all the cases, we can see that QB-BC is superior to all the other polynomial-time tests. QB-BC2 is slightly worse than QB-BC but the time complexity is lower. Since QB-BC and QB-BC2 are designed from a more pessimistic test than the analysis by Guan et al. [29] in pseudo-polynomial time, they are worse. But, we note that there is a significant gap in time complexity between QB-BC, QB-BC2, and Guan. Overall, the tests derived by using the k 2 Q framework perform reasonably well with their low time complexity.\n• QB-BC (from k 2 Q): Eq.

Thanks to the independence upon the task and platform models in the framework, k 2 Q can be viewed as a \"block-box\" interface that can result in sufficient utilization-based analyses for a wide range of applications in real-time systems under fixedpriority scheduling. We believe that the k 2 Q framework has high potential to be adopted to solve several other problems for analyzing other task models in real-time systems with fixedpriority scheduling. The framework can be used, once the 6 The time complexity is mainly due to the calculation of T to get the M -1 tasks with the maximum carry-in execution time since the other operations can be done in O(1) time complexity by using proper data structures to calculate the values when we intend to test task τ k+1 after task τ k . Specifically, due to the predefined last release time ordering, when we intend to test task τ k+1 after task τ k , we only have to insert task τ k to be indexed as 1 and updating\nfrom k-1 i=1 (U i k-1 =i C ) M 2 T k to k i=1 (U i k =i C ) M 2 T k\n(under the new ordering) takes only constant time complexity. Finding task set T can be implemented by using a min heap to store the M -1 tasks in T . When we move from testing task τ k (when k ≥ M ) to task τ k+1 , we need to compare whether C k is larger than the minimum execution time of the tasks in the heap. If no, we keep the same task set T ; if yes, we pop out the task with the minimum execution time in the heap, and insert task τ k into the heap. By using the heap, this operation requires time complexity O(log M ). Calculating C k+1 from C k with the help of the heap can be done in O(1) time complexity.\ncorresponding k-point last-release scheduling test or response time analysis can be constructed. Moreover, our proposed frameworks, k 2 U and k 2 Q, provide a solid mathematical foundation for deriving polynomialtime utilization-based schedulability tests and response time analyses almost automatically. That is, utilization-based analyses are almost automatically derived if the schedulability tests can be formulated in the scope of the frameworks. We have demonstrated several applications in this paper. Some models have introduced pretty high dynamics, but we can still handle the response time analysis and schedulability test with proper constructions so\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}}
