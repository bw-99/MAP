With Y = [Y 2 , Y 3 , . . . , Y n ] and\nE(Y ) = T ∈N * |K T | ≤ Y |T |(142)\nit is also easy to see that\nE(J ) =   T ∈Nn,2 [|K T | ≤ (1 + ε)K n ]   ∪ E(Y ).\nupon using (141) and (142) in (140). Using a standard union bound, we now get\nP [E(J )] ≤ P [E(Y )] + T ∈Nn,2 P [|K T | ≤ (1 + ε)K n ] .\nIt was shown in [37, Proposition 7.2] that given P n = Ω(n) and lim n→∞ K n = ∞, we have\nP [E(Y )] = o(1).(143)\nNoting that lim n→∞ K n = ∞ holds in view of Lemma 7 and P n = Ω(n) by assumption, we conclude that (143) holds under the assumptions enforced in Proposition 3.\nIn order to compute T ∈Nn,2\n[|K T | ≤ (1 + ε)K n ],\nwe use exchangeability and the fact that\n|N n,2 | = n 2 . With K 1,2 = S 1 ∪ S 2 , we find P [E(J )] ≤ o(1) + n 2 P [K 1,2 ≤ ⌊(1 + ε)K n ⌋] .(144)\nThen, from (144), the desired conclusion (133) (for Proposition 3) will follow if we show that\nn 2 P [K 1,2 ≤ ⌊(1 + ε)K n ⌋] = o(1).(145)\nThis will also be established by means of the bounds given in [36]. To this end, it was shown [36,Proposition 7.4.11, under the condition Kn Pn = o(1) that\nP [K 1,2 ≤ ⌊(1 + ε)K n ⌋] ≤ Γ(ε) K n P n Kn(1-ε)\n, with Γ(ε) := (1 + ε)e 1+ε 1-ε . Using this bound, we now obtain\nn 2 P [K 1,2 ≤ ⌊(1 + ε)K n ⌋] ≤ Γ(ε)n 2 (1-ε)Kn K n P n Kn(1-ε) . (146\n)\nGiven P n ≥ σn and Kn Pn = o(1), there exist a sequence w n satisfying lim n→+∞ w n = ∞ such that for all n sufficiently large, we have\nP n ≥ max{σn, K n w n }.\nAs noted before, it also holds that lim n→∞ K n = ∞ in view of Lemma 7. It is now easy to see that\nn 2 Kn (1-ε) K n P n ≤ min n -1+ 2 Kn (1-ε) K n σ , e 2 ln n Kn (1-ε) w n ≤ max n -1 2 ln n σ , e 2 (1-ε)\nw n for all n sufficiently large to ensure that K n ≥ 4/(1ε). The last inequality follows by considering the cases K n ≥ ln n and K n < ln n separately for each n on the given range. It follows that\nlim n→∞ Γ(ε)n 2 Kn (1-ε) K n P n = 0,\nand the desired conclusion (145) follows from (146).
