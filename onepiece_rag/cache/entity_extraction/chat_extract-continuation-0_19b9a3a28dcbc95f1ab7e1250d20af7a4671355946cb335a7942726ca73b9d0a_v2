Noisy features and inappropriate embedding dimension assignments can deteriorate the performance of recommender systems and introduce unnecessary complexity in model training and online serving. Optimizing the input configuration of DNN models, including feature selection and embedding dimension assignment, has become one of the essential topics in feature engineering. However, in existing industrial practices, feature selection and dimension search are optimized sequentially, i.e., feature selection is performed first, followed by dimension search to determine the optimal dimension size for each selected feature. Such a sequential optimization mechanism increases training costs and risks generating suboptimal input configurations. To address this problem, we propose a differentiable neural input razor (i-Razor) that enables joint optimization of feature selection and dimension search. Concretely, we introduce an end-to-end differentiable model to learn the relative importance of different embedding regions of each feature. Furthermore, a flexible pruning algorithm is proposed to achieve feature filtering and dimension derivation simultaneously. Extensive experiments on two large-scale public datasets in the Click-Through-Rate (CTR) prediction task demonstrate the efficacy and superiority of i-Razor in balancing model complexity and performance. </p><h1>sections</h1><h2>heading</h2> <p>INTRODUCTION </p><h2>text</h2> <p>I N this era of information overload, recommender systems powered by information technology and deep learning have become an effective way to retrieve potentially useful information for users from a huge range of options [1], [2], [3]. Deep learning recommender systems enhance recommendation performance by capturing complex correlations between features [4]. Experts resort to feature engineering, generating categorical, numerical, statistical, and cross features, to better understand the user's interests. However, due to the universal approximation property [5] of deep neural networks (DNN), feeding noisy features into a DNN model can adversely affect predictive performance [4], [6]. Meanwhile, because the embedding lookup table dominates both the size and inductive bias of DNN-based recommendation models [7], the embedding dimensions of input features are crucial to the performance and complexity of recommender systems. Therefore, it is highly desired to efficiently identify effective features from the original feature set and specify appropriate embedding dimensions. As illustrated in Figure 1, conventional industrial practices typically optimize feature selection and embedding dimension allocation separately. In contrast, this work explores jointly optimizing both in an end-to-end fashion. Feature selection is a crucial task in recommender systems and has been the subject of extensive research. Previous studies have categorized feature selection methods into three main categories: Filter, Wrapper, and Embedded methods [8], [9], [10]. Filter methods measure the discriminant attributes of features through criteria such as information gain [11] and feature consistency [12], so as to extract high-ranked features. Wrapper methods optimize feature subsets by using performance assessments such as the K-nearest neighbor (KNN) algorithm and linear discriminant analysis (LDA) instead of solely relying on evaluation criteria [13]. Compared with Filter and Wrapper, Embedded methods, such as the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) [14] and the gradient-boosting decision tree (GBDT) [15], [16], incorporate feature selection as part of the training process. Despite compensating for the drawbacks of low efficiency in Filter and high computational cost in Wrapper, the effectiveness of Embedded methods is substantially dependent on conductive parameters and strict model assumptions [9]. Although the aforementioned feature selection methods have proven effective in several scenarios, there could be a mismatch between the subset of features selected to optimize the feature selection model and the subset that would ideally serve the target DNN model. Recognizing that DNN models can capture more complex feature interactions, it would be logical to use the target DNN model to guide feature selection directly. In light of this, we propose a model-consistent feature selection approach that integrates the target DNN model into the feature selection process. Our approach belongs to the Embedded methods in a broad sense, but there is a notable difference between our study and previous work: we evaluate the importance of features from the point of view of each feature's optimal embedding dimension size under the target DNN model.\nIn recent years, there has been an increasing interest in studying embedding dimensions, as the embedding layer impacts on both the scale and the inductive bias of DNNbased recommendation models [7]. Specifying an adaptive embedding dimension for each feature is a problem of exponential complexity. A common practice is to set a unified value for all features by hyperparameter tuning experiments or relying on expert knowledge. However, such practice does not distinguish between different features and can be memory inefficient. Inspired by recent progress in neural architecture search (NAS) [17], methods based on reinforcement learning [18], differentiable search [19], [20], pruning [21], and so forth, have been proposed to perform dimension search at either field level or feature level 1 . Despite the ability of these methods to reduce model parameters without compromising model performance given a carefully selected feature subset, their effectiveness without feature selection remains unexplored. The dependency on feature selection effectively equates to assuming all input features are beneficial during the dimension search process. We believe that there is a necessity to conduct dimension search\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>I-RAZOR<|>CONCEPT<|>i-Razor is a differentiable neural input razor designed for feature selection and dimension search in DNN-based recommender systems, optimizing input configurations to improve performance and reduce complexity.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DNN-BASED RECOMMENDER SYSTEMS<|>CONCEPT<|>DNN-based recommender systems utilize deep learning techniques to enhance recommendation performance by capturing complex correlations between various features.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>FEATURE SELECTION<|>CONCEPT<|>Feature selection is a critical process in machine learning that involves identifying and selecting a subset of relevant features for model training to improve performance and reduce overfitting.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DIMENSION SEARCH<|>CONCEPT<|>Dimension search refers to the process of determining the optimal size of embedding dimensions for selected features in machine learning models, particularly in deep learning.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CLICK-THROUGH-RATE PREDICTION<|>EVENT<|>Click-Through-Rate (CTR) prediction is a task in recommender systems that aims to predict the likelihood of a user clicking on a particular item based on various features.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>EXPERIMENTS<|>EVENT<|>Extensive experiments conducted on large-scale public datasets to evaluate the efficacy and superiority of the i-Razor approach in balancing model complexity and performance.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>I-RAZOR<|>DNN-BASED RECOMMENDER SYSTEMS<|>i-Razor is specifically designed to optimize feature selection and dimension search within DNN-based recommender systems, enhancing their performance.<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>FEATURE SELECTION<|>DIMENSION SEARCH<|>Feature selection and dimension search are interrelated processes that are crucial for optimizing the input configuration of DNN models.<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>DNN-BASED RECOMMENDER SYSTEMS<|>CLICK-THROUGH-RATE PREDICTION<|>DNN-based recommender systems are often employed in tasks like Click-Through-Rate prediction to improve user engagement and recommendation accuracy.<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>I-RAZOR<|>CLICK-THROUGH-RATE PREDICTION<|>The i-Razor approach is applied in Click-Through-Rate prediction tasks to enhance the selection of features and dimensions, thereby improving prediction accuracy.<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>EXPERIMENTS<|>I-RAZOR<|>The experiments conducted demonstrate the effectiveness of the i-Razor method in optimizing feature selection and dimension search in DNN-based recommender systems.<|>9)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
