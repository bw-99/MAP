Additionally, the downstream effects of knocking down a particular gene leads to compensatory mechanisms in the cell, altering the expression of other genes. This necessitates benchmarking computational models based on their accuracy to identify knockeddown genes and predict subsequent changes in the expression of other genes. We evaluated statistical models for differential gene expression in CRISPRi experiments, including the Mann-Whitney U test, t-test, and sc-OTGM, as shown in Table 1. We assessed how often each method placed the true knockeddown gene within the top-k results. Lower p-values from the Mann-Whitney U test and t-test correlate with higher rankings. sc-OTGM performs exceptionally well in Top-1 accuracy, showing its effectiveness in identifying the most likely perturbed gene. The performance advantage of sc-OTGM decreases as the ranking threshold increases. In our experiments, we investigated the impact of 57 single-gene knockdowns, featuring BIN1 as a case study in the paper. The dataset for this case study, comprising 382 cells (315 control and 67 target), was split into an 80-20 train-test ratio. The extremely limited size of the dataset presented significant challenges in training our model from scratch and fine-tuning existing foundation models for the CRISPRi experiment. Our results confirm that sc-OTGM accurately predicts the direction of expression level changes among DEGs, distinguishing between upregulated and downregulated genes following BIN1 knockdown. However, the differences between the magnitudes of model predictions and actual values highlight the potential advantages of nonlinear models in capturing the complex dynamics of gene regulation. Furthermore, based on sc-OTGM's ranking, a cutoff of 100 is set to select the top predicted DEGs.\nPredicted DEGs are obtained from the top of the ranked gene list, and compared against the list of known DEGs. We conducted Fisher's exact test which yielded a p-Value of 6.39e-08, significantly below the standard threshold of 0.05. This confirms a strong statistical correlation between known DEGs after BIN1 knockdown and those predicted by sc-OTGM. While this analysis focuses on BIN1, Table 3 presents results for all targeted gene knockdowns, showing p-Values well below 0.05, validating the performance on DEG enrichment. Additionally, sc-OTGM demonstrated a mean accuracy of 75.2% ± 15.4% and F1-score of 0.79 ± 0.14, predicting the directionality of expression changes (upregulation or downregulation) in DEGs.  scGPT introduces a variant of masked language modeling (MLM) that mimics the auto-regressive generation in natural language processing, where the masked genes are iteratively predicted according to the model's confidence. Geneformer completely abandons the precise expression levels of genes. Instead, it models the rank of gene expressions and constructs sequences of genes according to their relative expression levels within each cell. The assessment of Geneformer and scGPT revealed significant limitations in their zero-shot performance Kedzierska et al. (2023). In various tasks, particularly in cell type annotation, these models are outperformed by simpler models, such as scVI Lopez et al. (2018) and strategies focusing on highly variable genes (HVGs). Kedzierska et al. ( 2023) also highlighted that aligning the pretraining dataset's tissue of origin with the target task did not consistently improve scGPT's performance, and broader pretraining datasets sometimes resulted in decreased effectiveness. Additionally, both Geneformer and scGPT showed inadequate handling of batch effects in zero-shot settings. Comparisons of scBERT and scGPT with L1-regularized logistic regression in cell type annotation under limited training data suggest that logistic regression performs more accurately, questioning the complexity needed for cell type annotation and the efficacy of MLM in learning gene embeddings Boiarsky et al. (2023). The failure of these models to accurately predict gene expression in zero-shot or limited data scenarios emphasizes the necessity for advancements in model design and training methodologies. CellPLM aggregates gene embeddings since gene expressions are bag-of-word features and leverages spatially-resolved transcriptomic (SRT) data in pre-training to facilitate learning cell-cell relations and introduce a Gaussian mixture prior as an additional inductive bias to overcome data limitation Wen et al. (2023).\nThe field has also seen advancements in generative modeling. Compositional Perturbation Autoencoder (CPA) has been developed to learn embeddings for both cell states and perturbations Lotfollahi et al. (2021). This is achieved within a unified framework, utilizing input data comprising two main components: gene expression data and perturbation data, such as drug types and dosages. CPA employs distinct encoder networks for cell states and perturbations, respectively. These encoders map input data into a latent space, from which the\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}}
