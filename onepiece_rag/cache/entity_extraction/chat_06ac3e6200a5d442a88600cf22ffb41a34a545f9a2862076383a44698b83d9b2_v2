For the rest of the proof, we replace > with ≥ in Eq. ( 37), as the supermum and the maximum are the same when presenting the inequality with ≥. We can also further drop the condition t * j ≥ 0, which just makes the resulting solution more pessimistic. This results in the following linear programming, which has a safe upper bound of Eq. ( 37),\nmaximize C k + k-1 i=1 α i t * i U i + k-1 i=1 β i C i (38a) such that C k + k-1 i=1 α i t * i U i + j-1 i=1 β i C i ≥ t * j , ∀j = 1, . . . , k -1. (38b)\nThe linear programming in Eq. ( 38) (by replacing > with ≥ and supremum with maximum) has k -1 variables and k -1 constraints. Like the proof of Lemma 1, we again adopt the extreme point theorem for linear programming [40] to solve the linear programming. Suppose that t\n† 1 , t † 2 , . . . , t † k-1\nis a feasible solution for the linear programming in (38) and\nt = max{t † 1 , t † 2 , . . . , t † k-1 }.\nBy the satisfaction of Eq. (38b), we know that\nC k + t k-1 i=1 α i U i + k-1 i=1 β i C i ≥ C k + k-1 i=1 α i t † i U i + k-1 i=1 β i C i ≥ t.\nAs a result, we have t ≤\nC k + k-1 i=1 βiCi 1-k-1 i=1 αiUi . That is, any feasible solution of Eq. (38) has t * j ≤ C k + k-1 i=1 βiCi 1-k-1 i=1 αiUi for any j = 1, 2, . . . , k -1. Under the assumption that k-1 i=1 α i U i < 1 and 0 ≤ k-1 i=1 β i C i ,\nthe above linear programming has a bounded objective function.\nThe only extreme point solution is to put\nC k + k-1 i=1 α i t * i U i + j-1 i=1 β i C i = t * j for every j = 1, 2, . . . , k -1.\nSince the objective function is bounded, by the extreme point theorem [40], we know that this extreme point solution is the optimal solution for the linear programming in Eq. (38). For such a solution, we know that\n∀j = 2, 3, . . . , k -1, t * j -t * j-1 = β j-1 C j-1 .(39)\nand\nt * 1 = C k + k-1 i=1 α i U i (t * 1 + i-1 =0 β C ),(40)\nwhere β 0 and C 0 are defined as 0 for notational brevity. Therefore, we know that\nt * 1 = C k + k-1 i=1 α i U i ( i-1 =0 β C ) 1 - k-1 i=1 α i U i .(41)\nClearly, the above extreme point solution is always feasible when\nk-1 i=1 α i U i < 1.\nTherefore, in this extreme point solution, the objective function of the linear programming is\nt * 1 + k-1 i=1 β i C i = C k + k-1 i=1 α i U i ( i-1 =0 β C ) 1 -k-1 i=1 α i U i + k-1 i=1 β i C i(42)\n= C k + k-1 i=1 β i C i -k-1 i=1 α i U i ( k-1 =i β C ) 1 -k-1 i=1 α i U i(43)\nwhich concludes the proof.\nuniprocessor systems, the time-demand analysis (TDA) developed in [35] can be adopted. That is, if\n∃t with 0 < t ≤ D k and C k + τi∈hp(τ k ) t T i C i ≤ t,(44)\nthen task τ k is schedulable under the fixed-priority scheduling algorithm, where hp(τ k ) is the set of tasks with higher priority than τ k , D k , C k , and T i represent τ k 's relative deadline, worst-case execution time, and period, respectively.
