INTRODUCTION </p><h2>text</h2> <p>Recommendation systems (RecSys) have been used in various applications to suggest items such as movies, music, books, shopping items, websites, etc. based on a user's previous behavior, as well as historical data from other users. The large amount of available data allows RecSys to leverage deep neural networks (DNN). DNN-based RecSys have been widely adopted by companies like Facebook [1] and Google [2] to improve their online services.\nThe typical DNN-based RecSys inference process [2] includes two stages: filtering and ranking. In the filtering stage, the system selects a set of candidate items from a large item database to be recommended based on a user's behavior. The ranking stage then computes the probability of choosing each candidate item. The items with the highest probability are finally returned to the user. Both the filtering and ranking stage use embedding tables (ETs) to capture and store user behaviors and item characteristics. The large ETs make the operations on them memory-bandwidth limited.\nSeveral algorithm and hardware solutions, e.g., ET compression [3], have been proposed to alleviate the memorybandwidth bottleneck. Near-memory computing has also been leveraged to solve the memory-bandwidth problem by bringing the compute units closer to the memory [4]. However, these solutions only focus on the ranking stage and not the filtering stage which are still impeded by memory bottlenecks due to the huge amount of data transfers.\nIn-memory-computing (IMC) is a computational paradigm that can alleviate the data transfer overhead between the memory and the compute unit by performing logic and arithmetic operations inside the memory unit itself. Different IMC kernels have been proposed, such as content addressable memories (CAMs), crossbars, general purpose computing-inmemory (GPCiM) and configurable memory arrays (CMAs). CAMs [5] can perform parallel content-based searches in the memory itself, crossbar arrays [6] can perform matrix-vector multiplications, and GPCiM [7] performs Boolean logic and arithmetic operations in memory. CMAs combine the functionalities of random access memory (RAM), CAM, GPCiM and crossbar in a single memory array. Ferroelectric fieldeffect transistors (FeFET) based crossbars, CAMS, GPCiM and CMAs have been designed [8], [9] and have shown that FeFET-based circuits are denser and faster than CMOS-based and ReRAM-based circuits. FeFETs can be easily integrated with the CMOS fabrication process and large-scale FeFET memories have also been fabricated in [10].\nIn this paper, we propose iMARS, an IMC architecture for RecSys. iMARS exploits an FeFET-based CMA fabric that combines the functionalities of RAM, ternary CAMs (TCAMs) and GPCiM. The FeFET-based CMA (from [9]) can switch its functionality to implement (i) TCAM-based searches to realize nearest neighbor search (NNS) in the filtering stage; and (ii) GPCiM-based arithmetic logic to implement the additions/accumulations in the filtering and ranking stage. Specific contributions of our work include (1) an integrated IMC fabric to simultaneously accelerate the filtering and ranking stages; (2) an IMC-friendly computation flow to facilitate mapping the RecSys algorithms to iMARS;\n(3) support for all ET related operations in memory by combining TCAM and GPCiM functionality in the CMA fabric; (4) a two-level memory hierarchy and corresponding in-memory adder trees to store the large ETs.\nWe have evaluated the latency and energy benefits of iMARS based on two widely used RecSys models: YoutubeDNN [2] on the MovieLens dataset [11] and Facebook DLRM [1] on the Criteo Kaggle dataset. The results show that for the MovieLens dataset, iMARS achieves a 16.8× (713×) end-to-end speedup (energy improvement) against the GPU implementation. For the Criteo Kaggle dataset which is widely used for the ranking task, the ranking model in Facebook DLRM is accelerated with iMARS, which leads to 13.2× (57.8×) improvement in latency (energy) improvement.   </p><h2>publication_ref</h2> <p>['b0', 'b1', 'b1', 'b2', 'b3', 'b4', 'b5', 'b6', 'b7', 'b8', 'b9', 'b8', 'b1', 'b10', 'b0'] </p><h2>figure_ref</h2> <p>[] </p><h2>table_ref</h2> <p>[] </p><h2>heading</h2>\n######################\noutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>RECOMMENDATION SYSTEMS<|>CONCEPT<|>Recommendation systems (RecSys) are systems that suggest items to users by predicting their preferences based on historical data, widely used in various applications such as movies, music, and shopping.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>IM-MEMORY COMPUTING<|>CONCEPT<|>In-memory computing (IMC) is a computational paradigm that reduces data transfer overhead by performing logic and arithmetic operations inside the memory unit itself, enhancing performance in systems like RecSys.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>I-MARS<|>CONCEPT<|>iMARS is a proposed IMC architecture designed to accelerate the filtering and ranking stages of deep neural network-based recommendation systems, utilizing FeFET-based embedding tables.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DEEP NEURAL NETWORKS<|>CONCEPT<|>Deep neural networks (DNN) are a class of machine learning models that are particularly effective in capturing complex patterns in large datasets, commonly used in recommendation systems.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>EMBEDDING TABLES<|>CONCEPT<|>Embedding tables (ETs) are data structures used in recommendation systems to capture and store user behaviors and item characteristics, essential for filtering and ranking processes.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MOVIELENS DATASET<|>CONCEPT<|>The MovieLens dataset is a widely used dataset for evaluating recommendation systems, providing user ratings for movies to facilitate performance testing of algorithms.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CRITEO KAGGLE DATASET<|>CONCEPT<|>The Criteo Kaggle dataset is a benchmark dataset used for ranking tasks in recommendation systems, containing user interactions and features for performance evaluation.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>I-MARS<|>RECOMMENDATION SYSTEMS<|>iMARS is specifically designed to enhance the performance of recommendation systems by improving the efficiency of the filtering and ranking stages.<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>IM-MEMORY COMPUTING<|>I-MARS<|>iMARS leverages in-memory computing principles to optimize data processing and reduce latency in recommendation systems.<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>DEEP NEURAL NETWORKS<|>RECOMMENDATION SYSTEMS<|>Deep neural networks are integral to modern recommendation systems, enabling them to analyze large datasets and improve item suggestions.<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>EMBEDDING TABLES<|>RECOMMENDATION SYSTEMS<|>Embedding tables are crucial components of recommendation systems, as they store user and item data necessary for making predictions.<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MOVIELENS DATASET<|>I-MARS<|>The MovieLens dataset is used to evaluate the performance of iMARS in improving recommendation system efficiency and effectiveness.<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CRITEO KAGGLE DATASET<|>I-MARS<|>The Criteo Kaggle dataset is utilized to assess the ranking capabilities of iMARS in recommendation systems, demonstrating its performance improvements.<|>7)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
