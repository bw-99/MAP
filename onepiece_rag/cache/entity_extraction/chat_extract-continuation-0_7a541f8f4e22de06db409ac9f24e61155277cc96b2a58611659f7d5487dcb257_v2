This can be done by normalizing the rating data before applying the recommender algorithm. Any normalization function h : R n×m → R n×m can be used for preprocessing. Ideally, this function is reversible to map the predicted rating on the normalized scale back to the original rating scale. Normalization is used to remove individual rating bias by users who consistently always use lower or higher ratings than other users. A popular method is to center the rows of the user-item rating matrix by\nh(r ui ) = r ui -ru ,\nwhere ru is the mean of all available ratings in row u of the user-item rating matrix R.\nOther methods like Z-score normalization which also takes rating variance into account can be found in the literature (see, e.g., Desrosiers and Karypis 2011).\nThe two main problems of user-based CF are that the whole user database has to be kept in memory and that expensive similarity computation between the active user and all other users in the database has to be performed.<h2>publication_ref</h2>['b8']<h2>figure_ref</h2>[]<h2>table_ref</h2>[]<h2>heading</h2>Item-based Collaborative Filtering<h2>text</h2>Item-based CF (Kitts et al. 2000;Sarwar et al. 2001;Linden et al. 2003;Deshpande and Karypis 2004) is a model-based approach which produces recommendations based on the relationship between items inferred from the rating matrix. The assumption behind this approach is that users will prefer items that are similar to other items they like.  To reduce the model size to n × k with k n, for each item only a list of the k most similar items and their similarity values are stored. The k items which are most similar to item i is denoted by the set S(i) which can be seen as the neighborhood of size k of the item. Retaining only k similarities per item improves the space and time complexity significantly but potentially sacrifices some recommendation quality (Sarwar et al. 2001).\nTo make a recommendation based on the model we use the similarities to calculate a weighted sum of the user's ratings for related items.<h2>publication_ref</h2>['b20', 'b37', 'b27', 'b7', 'b37']<h2>figure_ref</h2>[]<h2>table_ref</h2>[]<h2>heading</h2>rai = 1<h2>text</h2>j∈S(i)∩{l ; r al =?} s ij j∈S(i)∩{l ; r al =?} s ij r aj (5) Figure 2 shows an example for n = 8 items with k = 3. For the similarity matrix S only the k = 3 largest entries are stored per row (these entries are marked using bold face). For the example we assume that we have ratings for the active user for items i 1 , i 5 and i 8 . The rows corresponding to these items are highlighted in the item similarity matrix. We can now compute the weighted sum using the similarities (only the reduced matrix with the k = 3 highest ratings is used) and the user's ratings. The result (below the matrix) shows that i 3 has the highest estimated rating for the active user.\nSimilar to user-based recommender algorithms, user-bias can be reduced by first normalizing the user-item rating matrix before computing the item-to-item similarity matrix.\nItem-based CF is more efficient than user-based CF since the model (reduced similarity matrix) is relatively small (N × k) and can be fully precomputed. Item-based CF is known to only produce slightly inferior results compared to user-based CF and higher order models which take the joint distribution of sets of items into account are possible (Deshpande and Karypis 2004). Furthermore, item-based CF is successfully applied in large scale recommender systems (e.g., by Amazon.com).<h2>publication_ref</h2>['b7']<h2>figure_ref</h2>[]<h2>table_ref</h2>[]<h2>heading</h2>User and Item-Based CF using 0-1 Data<h2>text</h2>Less research is available for situations where no large amount of detailed directly elicited rating data is available. However, this is a common situation and occurs when users do not want to directly reveal their preferences by rating an item (e.g., because it is to time consuming). In this case preferences can only be inferred by analyzing usage behavior. For example, we can easily record in a supermarket setting what items a customer purchases. However, we do not know why other products were not purchased. The reason might be one of the following.\n• The customer does not need the product right now.\n• The customer does not\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>ITEM-BASED COLLABORATIVE FILTERING<|>EVENT<|>Item-based Collaborative Filtering is a model-based approach that produces recommendations based on the relationship between items inferred from the rating matrix.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>USER-BASED COLLABORATIVE FILTERING<|>EVENT<|>User-based Collaborative Filtering is a method that recommends items based on the similarity between users and their ratings.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>AMAZON.COM<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Amazon.com is a large-scale e-commerce platform that successfully applies item-based collaborative filtering in its recommendation systems.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ITEM-BASED COLLABORATIVE FILTERING<|>USER-BASED COLLABORATIVE FILTERING<|>Item-based CF and User-based CF are both methods used in recommendation systems to suggest items to users based on different criteria.<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>AMAZON.COM<|>ITEM-BASED COLLABORATIVE FILTERING<|>Amazon.com utilizes item-based collaborative filtering to enhance its recommendation system for users.<|>8)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
