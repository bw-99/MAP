RecSys Operation Mapping </p><h2>text</h2> <p>Given the iMARS architecture, careful mapping of the computation, how in Fig. 1 to iMARS is required in order to design the control sequence properly. The crossbars stored the trained weights of the DNN stack and the ItETs and UIETs store the trained ETs for the sparse feature vectors. Fig. 3 illustrates such a mapping where the labels (1a)-(2d*) indicates. We first discuss the operations in the filtering stage. (1a) The sparse features are sent to the corresponding ETs, i.e., UIETs and ItET for lookups and pooling. The embedding vectors of the features are obtained by looking up the stored ETs in the ItET CMAs and UIET CMAs using the RAM mode of the CMA. The retrieved embeddings are then aggregated (indicated by (1b*) in Fig. 3) by the in-memory adder, intramat and intra-bank adder trees. (1b) the dense features are sent to the pre-trained filtering sparse feature DNN stack which is implemented with the crossbar arrays. (1c) All features are then sent to the filtering DNN. The output of the filtering DNN is a user embedding vector (u i in Fig. 3). (1d) The user embedding vector is then sent to the ItET to retrieve the N nearest neighbors as candidate items inside the ItET CMAs. The indices of these retrieved (i.e., candidate) item embeddings are then stored in the item buffer (See (1d*) inf Fig. 3).\nWe now discuss the operations in the ranking stage. (2a) Each candidate item in the item buffer is then analyzed by the next steps with respect to the user's preferences. (2b) By using the item indices in the item buffer, their corresponding item embeddings are retrieved from the stored ET in the ItET and the ranking embeddings are retrieved in the stored ET in the ranking UIETs using the RAM mode. Note that some UIETs used in the filtering mode can be shared with the ranking stage. The item embeddings are pooled with the ranking embeddings either by concatenation or by an ADD operation using the in-memory adder, intra-bank and interbank adder trees. (See (2b*) in Fig. 3) The output forms a new set of embedding features. Together with the dense features are fed to the ranking DNN stack implemented in crossbars. (2c) the dense features are again obtained from the trained ranking DNN stack. (2d) The remaining crossbar arrays implement the ranking DNN with the pooled feature embeddings as input and return the click-through-rate (CTR) to the CTR buffer. The CTR buffer is a CMA that stores the CTR for each candidate item and the item index which are used for selecting the final top-k items. (2e) The CTR buffer then performs a topk operation using the threshold match mode of the CMA by searching a vector of all 1's (the maximum allowable CMA input). </p><h2>publication_ref</h2> <p>[] </p><h2>figure_ref</h2> <p>['fig_0', 'fig_2', 'fig_2', 'fig_2', 'fig_2', 'fig_2'] </p><h2>table_ref</h2> <p>[] </p><h2>heading</h2> <p>IV. EVALUATION </p><h2>text</h2> <p>We evaluated the RecSys implementations with two RecSys instances: (1) YoutubeDNN model [2] on the MovieLens 1M dataset, which includes both the filtering and ranking stage; (2) DLRM model [1] targeting at the ranking stage on the Criteo Kaggle dataset. The configurations of the two RecSys shown in Table I were implemented on Nvidia RTX 1080 GPU. We used the tools Nvidia-smi and lineprofiler to obtain energy and latency, respectively. We only compared with the GPU evaluation as other accelerators use older RecSys models and datasets.\nWe dimension B, M and C based on the largest dataset used in our evaluation (i.e., the Criteo Kaggle) with the configuration shown in Table . I. Each ET have different number of entries. In this configuration, the maximum size of the ETs in the Criteo Kaggle is 30,000 entries. Since each CMA has 256 rows, 118 CMAs are required to store the embedding table. The number of arrays is rounded up to the nearest power-oftwo value, i.e., 128. We choose C=32, which corresponds to 4 mats (M =4) working in parallel inside each bank, to have a balance between storing small and large ETs. The outputs from the 4 mats are accumulated at the bank level. Finally, the Criteo Kaggle dataset has 26 sparse features for ranking. Hence, we dimension iMARS with 32 banks (B=32) to accomodate all these features. The other features are also mapped accordingly,  with some mats and CMAs deactivated in a bank according to the size of the ET. We use 26 activated banks, 104 activated mats and 2860 activated CMAs for the Criteo Kaggle dataset.\nFor the MovieLens dataset (also used in our evaluation\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>IMARS ARCHITECTURE<|>concept<|>The iMARS architecture is an in-memory-computing design aimed at optimizing the filtering and ranking stages of recommendation systems by efficiently mapping computations and storing trained weights in crossbar arrays.)\n(\"entity\"<|>RECSYS<|>concept<|>Recommendation systems (RecSys) are systems that suggest items to users based on their preferences, utilizing historical data and various computational techniques.)\n(\"entity\"<|>DNN STACK<|>concept<|>The DNN stack refers to a deep neural network architecture used in the filtering and ranking stages of recommendation systems to process input features and generate user embedding vectors.)\n(\"entity\"<|>EMBEDDING TABLES<|>concept<|>Embedding tables (ETs) are data structures that store learned representations of features, used in recommendation systems to facilitate lookups and pooling of feature vectors.)\n(\"entity\"<|>CANDIDATE ITEMS<|>concept<|>Candidate items are potential recommendations generated for users based on their preferences and the outputs of the filtering DNN.)\n(\"entity\"<|>CLICK-THROUGH RATE (CTR)<|>concept<|>Click-through rate (CTR) is a metric used to evaluate the effectiveness of recommendations, indicating the ratio of users who click on a suggested item.)\n(\"entity\"<|>MOVIELENS DATASET<|>concept<|>The MovieLens dataset is a collection of movie ratings used to evaluate recommendation systems, particularly in the context of filtering and ranking stages.)\n(\"entity\"<|>CRITEO KAGGLE DATASET<|>concept<|>The Criteo Kaggle dataset is a dataset used for benchmarking recommendation systems, particularly focusing on ranking tasks.)\n(\"entity\"<|>NVIDIA RTX 1080 GPU<|>organization<|>The Nvidia RTX 1080 GPU is a graphics processing unit used for running and evaluating the performance of recommendation system models.)\n(\"relationship\"<|>IMARS ARCHITECTURE<|>RECSYS<|>The iMARS architecture is designed to enhance the performance of recommendation systems by optimizing their computational processes<|>9)\n(\"relationship\"<|>DNN STACK<|>RECSYS<|>The DNN stack is a critical component of recommendation systems, used for processing features and generating user embeddings<|>8)\n(\"relationship\"<|>EMBEDDING TABLES<|>DNN STACK<|>Embedding tables are utilized by the DNN stack to retrieve and process feature vectors during the filtering and ranking stages<|>7)\n(\"relationship\"<|>CANDIDATE ITEMS<|>DNN STACK<|>Candidate items are generated based on the outputs of the DNN stack, which analyzes user preferences<|>8)\n(\"relationship\"<|>CLICK-THROUGH RATE (CTR)<|>CANDIDATE ITEMS<|>The click-through rate (CTR) is calculated based on user interactions with candidate items, serving as a performance metric<|>7)\n(\"relationship\"<|>MOVIELENS DATASET<|>RECSYS<|>The MovieLens dataset is used to evaluate the performance of recommendation systems, particularly in the filtering and ranking stages<|>6)\n(\"relationship\"<|>CRITEO KAGGLE DATASET<|>RECSYS<|>The Criteo Kaggle dataset is used for benchmarking recommendation systems, especially focusing on ranking tasks<|>6)\n(\"relationship\"<|>NVIDIA RTX 1080 GPU<|>RECSYS<|>The Nvidia RTX 1080 GPU is employed to run and evaluate the recommendation system models<|>5) \n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
