This multi-embedding scheme represents a source entity with multiple distinct topical affinities by globally clustering items and aggregating the source entity's engagements with clusters. Recognizing that user-item engagements may often be sparse, we propose a nearest-neighbor smoothing to enrich these mixture representation. Our smoothed mixture representation better models user preferences retrieving a diverse set of candidate items reflective of a user's multiple interests. This significantly improves recall on candidate retrieval tasks on three datasets including Twitter-Follow, a dataset we curate and release to the community. </p><h2>publication_ref</h2> <p>[] </p><h2>figure_ref</h2> <p>[] </p><h2>table_ref</h2> <p>[] </p>\r\n######################\r\noutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}}
