Existing feature selection methods include the following three categories: Filter, Wrapper, and Embedded methods [23]. Filter methods measure the association between the feature and the class label via some specific evaluation criteria [22], such as information gain [24], minimum redundant maximum relevance [25], and spatiotemporal preserving representations [26]. This stream of research also includes feature selection methods based on statistical tests, e.g., Chi-squared [27], Pearson correlation, and ANOVA F-value test [28]. Input features that demonstrate a significant statistical relationship with the output variable are retained and utilized for further analysis, while others are discarded. Filter methods are expected to have the highest computational efficiency and tend to keep more features from the total feature space [9], [10]. By contrast, Wrapper methods adopt specific learning techniques such as KNN [29], Naive Bayes [30], LDA [31], and adaptive semisupervised feature analysis [32] to assess the performance of feature combinations [13]. Though more efficient for feature selection than Filter methods, Wrapper methods require higher computational resources [33]. In these two types of feature selection methods, the feature selection process and the model training process are distinctly separate.\nUnlike Filter and Wrapper methods, Embedded methods such as LASSO [14], GBDT [15], and semi-supervised recurrent convolutional attention models [34] integrate the feature selection process with the model training process, i.e., feature selection is performed automatically during the model training process [8]. Recently, the advancement of NAS has spawned a new research hotspot in Embedded methods, the automatic search for useful features with AutoML techniques [10], [35]. For instance, AutoFIS [36] proposes a gating mechanism to identify and mask the intersection of useless features in factorization models. AutoField [37] assigns two operators to each field, one for selecting and the other for ignoring that field. By comparing the relative importance of these two operators, it determines whether to select that field or not. Operators of each field of AutoField [37] and AutoFIS [36] are independent of each other, while AdaFS [38] assigns associated operators to each field through softmax operation, and measures the relative importance of fields corresponding to each operator by comparing the weight of each operator, so as to screen features. Meanwhile, there has been a growing interest in automatic feature selection in deep learning-based sequential recommendation systems. For instance, NASR [35] made significant strides in designing a hybrid sequential recommendation model with the aim to ensemble the capacity of both self-attention and convolutional architectures. The proposed method can automatically select the architecture operation on each layer.\nInspired by these advancements, our approach, i-Razor, also belongs to the Embedded category, but with a unique perspective. i-Razor facilitates model-consistent feature selection by evaluating the importance of each feature concerning its optimal embedding dimension in the target DNN model. Building upon the foundation laid by AutoField, we propose a 0-dimension absorbing operator, which signifies the action of deselecting a specific feature. In addition, we enhance the existing design of the dimension search space, which commonly segments the embedding dimensions, by introducing the concept of the 0-dimension operator into this process. The weight associated with each operator measures the relative importance of these divisions, with 0 dimension indicating that all regions should be masked. By considering combinations of these operators, we derive the final input configuration. This method allows us to perform dimension search and feature selection concurrently, offering a more efficient manner to ensure that the chosen features and embedding dimensions contribute to the target model's performance.<h2>publication_ref</h2>['b21', 'b22', 'b21', 'b23', 'b24', 'b25', 'b26', 'b27', 'b8', 'b9', 'b28', 'b29', 'b30', 'b31', 'b12', 'b32', 'b13', 'b14', 'b33', 'b7', 'b9', 'b34', 'b35', 'b36', 'b36', 'b35', 'b37', 'b34']<h2>figure_ref</h2>[]<h2>table_ref</h2>[]<h2>heading</h2>Dimension Search Techniques<h2>text</h\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}}
