( 10) by rephrasing based on the condition in Eq. ( 12) is\nt * k - k-1 i=1 (αiUit * i + βiCi) (13) =t * k - k-1 i=1 αiUi t * k - k-1 =i β C + βiCi (14) =t * k - k-1 i=1 αiUit * k + k-1 i=1 βiCi - k-1 i=1 αiUi k-1 =i β C(15)\nwhich means that\nC * k ≥ t * k (1 - k-1 i=1 α i U i ) - k-1 i=1 (β i C i - α i U i ( k-1 =i β C )).\n[Step 3:] The rest of the proof shows that other feasible extreme point solutions (that allow t * j to be 0 for some higherpriority task τ j ) are with worse objective values for Eq. (10). Under the assumption that\nk-1 i=1 β i C i ≤ t k ≤ t * k , if t * j is set to 0, there are two cases: (1) t * k - k-1 i=j β i C i > 0 or (2) t * k - k-1 i=j β i C i = 0. In the former case, we can simply set t * j to t * k - k-1\ni=j β i C i to improve the objective function without introducing any violation of the constraints. In the latter case, the value of t * j can only be set to 0 in any feasible solutions. Therefore, we conclude that any other feasible extreme point solutions for Eq. ( 10) are worse. </p><h2>publication_ref</h2> <p>['b39', 'b39', 'b9', 'b9'] </p><h2>figure_ref</h2> <p>[] </p><h2>table_ref</h2> <p>[] </p><h2>heading</h2> <p>Note that the above solution of C * </p><h2>text</h2> <p>k is still a function of t * k . We need to find the minimization of C * k with respect to t * k based on the fact t * k ≥ t k . Due to the assumption that 1 -\nk-1 i=1 α i U i ≥ 0 and t * k ≥ t k , we know that t * k (1 - k-1 i=1 α i U i ) ≥ t k (1 - k-1 i=1 α i U i ). Therefore, C * k = t k (1 - k-1 i=1 α i U i ) - k-1 i=1 (β i C i -α i U i ( k-1 =i β C )) when 1 - k-1 i=1 α i U i ≥ 0 and k-1 i=1 β i C i ≤ t k , which concludes the proof.\nLemma 1 can be applied only when the last release time ordering of the k -1 higher-priority tasks is given. We demonstrate the importance of the last release time ordering by using the following example. 3   Example 4.\nConsider that k = 3 and |hp(τ k )| is 2. For the two tasks in hp(τ k ), let C 1 = 2, U 1 = 0.2, T 1 = 10 and C 2 = 4, U 2 = 0.5, T 2 = 8. Suppose that t 3 = D 3 = T 3 = 36.\nBy the transformation in Example 1, we know that α i = 1 and\nβ i = 1 for i = 1, 2.\nThere are two last release time orderings. Suppose that π 1 : {τ 1 , τ 2 } → {1, 2} and π 2 : {τ 1 , τ 2 } → {2, 1}. That is, the last release time ordering is τ 1 , τ 2 in π 1 , and the last release time ordering is τ 2 , τ 1 in π 2 . Now, we can use Lemma 1 based on π 1 and π 2 : 3 To demonstrate the impact of the last release time ordering, we use the original task indexes before applying π 1 or π 2 whenever referring to Example 4.\n• For π 1 , the schedulability condition in Lemma 1 shows that task τ 3 in Example 4 can meet the deadline if\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}}
