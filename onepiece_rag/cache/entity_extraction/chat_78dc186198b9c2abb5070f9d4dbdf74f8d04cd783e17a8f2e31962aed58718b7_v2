We have mentioned in previous sections, the model-only approach in factor selection suffers from the interpretability issue. Traders need to understand the factor before applied in practice. Also, a human is better in a heuristic search of the best combination within the vast factor space. More importantly, in the financial domain, there is no model that works in the long term. It will be critical to have human stand by models, and would be better to early adjust accordingly.\nThe visual design and its learning curve. Notice that stock traders may not have a strong background in visualization. Thus, we tried to strike a balance between the intuitiveness and expressiveness of visualization. On one hand, classical designs such as bar charts and line charts are employed in iQUANT , due to their intuitiveness and users' familiarity. On the other hand, our designs are tailored to the target users. For example in the factor view, green/red are used to indicate the decline/rise of stock prices, according to the convention of our target market. The effectiveness of iQUANT design is confirmed by the user study result and expert feedback. Most subjects found iQUANT easy to learn and understand.\nThe user study and its design choices. We evaluated iQUANT through a formal user study focusing on the performance of factor/stock selection. The study would have accounted for more stages of iQUANT by looking at the final stock returns, or the accuracy in predicting. We stayed in the scope of evaluating factors for two reasons. First, the stock return by an interactive factor investing system is determined in complex interactions among factor/stock selection, predictive model, and trading strategy. A higher stock return in the study may or may not be directly correlated with a better factor selection design. Second, there is currently no com-mercial tool that supports end-to-end interactive factor investing. We compare iQUANT with a baseline design, which is not natively integrated with prediction models and trading strategies.\nThe deployment of iQUANT and its extensibility. The investment industry is highly closed as the winning secret can be too valuable to disclose. This closedness prohibits a more practical approach to directly optimize deployed tools. Instead, we developed a homegrown interactive factor investing pipeline and an end-to-end system. Because of the complexity of quantitative investment, we mainly focus on improving the factor selection in the pipeline. We demonstrated the effectiveness of iQUANT by using the 20-year real stock market data. However, our system can also be deployed to take in real-time data. As a next step, we plan to customize and integrate iQUANT into the production system of our industrial collaborators, in the hope of making real impacts on the industry.<h2>publication_ref</h2>[]<h2>figure_ref</h2>['fig_2']<h2>table_ref</h2>[]<h2>heading</h2>Conclusion<h2>text</h2>This paper presents iQUANT, a visual analytics system that seamlessly integrates algorithmic and user-steered feature selection methods for interactive factor investing. On the analytics side, we explore the use of sparse regression models that jointly optimizing factor selection and stock prediction processes. On the visualization side, we propose multiple coordinated visual designs to comprehensively illustrate importance metrics of each factor, including its positive/negative contribution to models, the factor stability and sensitivity. On top of the prediction model and visualization design, iQUANT develops an interactive framework that encloses factor refinement and portfolio construction in the same visual analytics loop. With iQUANT , traders can optimize their investment strategy and evaluate them in industry-standard backtesting. We demonstrate the value of iQUANT through one formal user study and two case studies, using a real stock market dataset recording the stock data in the past 30 years. On the selection of investment time and stock portfolio, our domain experts achieved excess returns from both individual stock and sector-based portfolios.<h2>publication_ref</h2>[]<h2>figure_ref</h2>[]<h2>table_ref</h2>[]<h1>references</h1><h2>ref_id</h2>b0<h2>title</h2>The interaction of value and momentum strategies<h2>journal</h2>Financial Analysts Journal<h2>year</h2>1997<h2>authors</h2>C S Asness<h2>ref_id</h2>b1<h2>title</h2>ifeed: Interactive feature extraction for engineering design<h2>journal</h2>American Society of Mechanical Engineers<h2>year</h2>2016<h2>authors</h2>H Bang; D Selva<h2>ref_id</h2>b2<h2>title</h2>Stacked graphs -geometry & aesthetics<h2>journal</h2>IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics<h2>year</h2>2008<h2>authors</h2>Byron L Wattenberg; M <h2>ref_id</h2>b3<h2>title</h2>Machine Learning for Factor Investing: R Version<h2>journal</h2>CRC Press<h2>year</h2>2020<h2>authors</h2>G Coqueret; T Guida<h2>ref_id</h2>b4<h2>title</h2><h2>journal</h2><h2>year</h2><h2>authors</h2> C\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}}
