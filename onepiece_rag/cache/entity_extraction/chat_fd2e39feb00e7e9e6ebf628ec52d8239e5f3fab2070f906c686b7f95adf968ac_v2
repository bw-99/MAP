To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, we conducted further analysis by classifying nodes into defined local substructures. As an example, consider the following, we set the nodes to the following three types: tree-like (𝜅 𝑖 ≥ -0.01); zero-like (-0.01 < 𝜅 𝑖 ≤ 0.01); positive-like (𝜅 𝑖 > 0.01). The curvature of each node is defined as the sum of curvatures over its edges, that is:\n𝜅 𝑖 = 1 |𝑁 𝑖 |\n𝑗 ∈𝑁 𝑖 𝜅 𝑖 𝑗 , where |𝑁 𝑖 | is the number of neighbors of node 𝑖, and 𝜅 𝑖 𝑗 is the curvature of the edge between nodes 𝑖 and 𝑗. This curvature measure was used to determine the local substructure of each node. In the following, we evaluated the performance of three models (GCN, HGCN, and the proposed method) on both the Cora and Airport datasets. Specifically, we calculated the accuracy/F1-score on the test set for nodes in each local substructure.\nThe results are shown in Table 8 and Table 9. The \"GT-Prop\" row in the Tables show the proportion of nodes belonging to each Overall, the study found that the models achieved comparable accuracy to the best achievable, but performance varied across different substructures. Specifically, Euclidean GCN outperformed HGCN on zero-density and densely connected areas, but underperformed on tree-like nodes. In contrast, HGCN showed improved accuracy for tree-like nodes, but lower accuracy on other substructures. The proposed model achieved a balance of performance across all substructures, with high accuracy for both tree-like and non-tree-like nodes.<h2>publication_ref</h2>[]<h2>figure_ref</h2>[]<h2>table_ref</h2>['tab_9', 'tab_10']<h2>heading</h2>C.4 Connections of the Discrete and Continuous Curvatures<h2>text</h2>The discrete curvature 𝜅 is computed in advance, which can be regarded as an edge weight. The continuous curvature 𝑐 of the predefined hyperbolic space is learnable and differentiable. For simplicity, we denote the learnable parameters of our model 𝜅HGCN as 𝜃 . Let us consider node classification as an example. If the groundtruth label of node x is y and the predicted label is ȳ, then we have ȳ = 𝜅HGCN(x, 𝜅, 𝜃, 𝑐) and the loss is given by 𝐿(y, ȳ). We can take the derivative of 𝑐 with respect to the loss, i.e., 𝜕𝐿 (y,ȳ) 𝜕𝑐 = 𝜕 (y,𝜅HGCN(x,𝜅,𝜃,𝑐 ) ) 𝜕𝑐\n. It is easy to see that the update of 𝑐 is constrained by 𝜅. In other words, we learn a good embedding space equipped with curvature 𝑐 that matches the graph structure through discrete Ricci curvature 𝜅.<h2>publication_ref</h2>[]<h2>figure_ref</h2>[]<h2>table_ref</h2>[]<h1>references</h1><h2>ref_id</h2>b0<h2>title</h2>Metric tree-like structures in realworld networks: an empirical study<h2>journal</h2>Networks<h2>year</h2>2016<h2>authors</h2>Muad Abu; -Ata ; Feodor F Dragan<h2>ref_id</h2>b1<h2>title</h2>Ricci curvature and the manifold learning problem<h2>journal</h2>Advances in Mathematics<h2>year</h2>2019<h2>authors</h2>G Antonio; Micah W Ache;  Warren<h2>ref_id</h2>b2<h2>title</h2>Tree-like structure in large social and information networks<h2>journal</h2>IEEE<h2>year</h2>2013<h2>authors</h2>Blair D Aaron B Adcock; Michael W Sullivan;  Mahoney<h2>ref_id</h2>b3<h2>title</h2>A theorem of Myers<h2>journal</h2>Duke Mathematical Journal<h2>year</h2>1957<h2>authors</h2> Ambrose<h2>ref_id</h2>b4<h2>title</h2>Hyperbolic Image Segmentation<h2>journal</h2><h2>year</h2>2022<h2>authors</h2>Mina Ghadimi; Atigh ; Julian Schoep; Erman Acar; Nanne Van Noord; Pascal Mettes<h2>ref_id</h2>b5<h2>title</h2>Constant curvature graph convolutional networks<h2>journal\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}}
