Note [CLS] denotes a BERTspecific special token that aggregates the content of the entire segment while [SEP] simply highlights the end of the sequence.\nPassing 𝑡 to the BERT model with pretrained parameters 𝑾 bert yields a sequence of contextual token embeddings 𝒉 [CLS] , 𝒉 1 , . . . , 𝒉 𝑛 , 𝒉 [SEP] , where 𝒉 [CLS] represents the aggregated context hidden state for the whole segment 𝑠.\nSubsequently, we employ a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) with trainable parameters 𝑾 mlp to predict relevance probabilities ŷ = [ ŷ1 , . . . , ŷ𝑀 ] ∈ R 𝑀 for all requirements in R. The classifying MLP consists of a fully-connected hidden layer followed by dropout and ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit) activation functions and a sigmoidal output layer.\nDuring training, we jointly optimize and finetune the parameters of the BERT model 𝑾 bert and the classification layer 𝑾 mlp to minimize the Binary Cross Entropy (BCE) loss between target labels 𝒚 and predicted probabilities ŷ.\nFinally, after assigning relevance scores over requirements for all 𝑠 𝑖 ∈ S, we sort the segments for each requirement 𝑟 𝑗 in descending order in order to recommend the top 𝐾 relevant text blocks.  </p><h2>publication_ref</h2> <p>['b2', 'b14'] </p><h2>figure_ref</h2> <p>[] </p><h2>table_ref</h2> <p>[] </p><h2>heading</h2> <p>EXPERIMENTS </p><h2>text</h2> <p>In the following sections, we introduce our two custom data sets of German sustainability reports, define our evaluation metrics, discuss the overall training setup, describe the competing baseline methods, and finally, evaluate results. </p><h2>publication_ref</h2> <p>[] </p><h2>figure_ref</h2> <p>[] </p><h2>table_ref</h2> <p>[] </p><h2>heading</h2> <p>Data </p><h2>text</h2> <p>We train and evaluate our algorithms on two novel sustainability reporting data sets. The first data set, named GRI, consists of 92 published sustainability reports from major German companies. The reports have been sourced in PDF format from the companies' websites. After the parsing step domain experts from the auditing industry annotated all text segments in accordance to the requirements of the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) standards. Concretely, we consider the 89 indicators of the GRI topic standards which cover the three main categories, economy, environment and social that are further split into granular topics like anti-corruption, energy consumption and human rights assessment. The annotation work load was equally split among three auditors which were supervised by a senior auditor. In multiple iterations, the created requirement labels have been validated and refined via double-checking randomly selected sample annotations and a qualitative inspection of the false positive and negative model predictions.\nThe second data set, named DNK, leverages the public sustainability reporting database from the German Sustainability Code 3 (DNK). The platform is used by the majority of German companies to annually disclose their sustainability activities with respect to 33 requirements from 20 DNK criteria, e.g. usage of natural resources and human rights. The categories and their requirements cover most of the GRI topics but are generally less granular. In contrast to the PDF documents of the GRI data set, the DNK reports in HTML format follow a predefined structure where each section of text segments answers a distinct requirement. Since the requirement descriptions precede their respective sections we can automatically retrieve the ground truth annotations from the HTML during the parsing process.\nTable 1 displays descriptive statistics for both data sets. Due to the smaller amount of training documents, the greater document size and the annotation sparsity, we consider the GRI data set the harder challenge for our models.
