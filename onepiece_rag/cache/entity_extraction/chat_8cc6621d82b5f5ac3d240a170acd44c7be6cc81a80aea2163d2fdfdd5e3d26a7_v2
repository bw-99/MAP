R2Fix runs a straightforward classification to identify the bug category and uses a match and transform engine (e.g., Coccinelle[66]) to generate patches. As the authors admitted, their target space represents <1% of bug reports in their dataset. Furthermore, it should be noted that, given the limited scope of the changes implemented in its fix patterns, R2Fix does not need to run tests for verifying that the generated patches do not break any functionality.This paper. We propose to investigate the feasibility of a program repair system driven by bug reports, thus we replace classical spectrum-based fault localization with Information Retrieval (IR)-based fault localization. Eventually, we propose iFixR, a new program repair workflow which considers a practical repair setup by imitating the fundamental steps of manual debugging. iFixR works under the following constraint:<h2>figure_data</h2><h2>figure_label</h2>2<h2>figure_type</h2>figure<h2>figure_id</h2>fig_2<h2>figure_caption</h2>Figure 2 :2Figure 2: The iFixR Program Repair Workflow.<h2>figure_data</h2><h2>figure_label</h2>123<h2>figure_type</h2>figure<h2>figure_id</h2>fig_3<h2>figure_caption</h2>Algorithm 1 : 2 F 3 F123Statement-level IR-based Fault Localization.
