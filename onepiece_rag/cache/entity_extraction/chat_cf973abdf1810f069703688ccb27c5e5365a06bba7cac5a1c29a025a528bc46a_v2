These graphs have received much attention and also been used in diverse application areas beyond secure sensor networks; e.g., cryptanalysis, social networks, and recommender systems. Formally, a random key graph with n nodes is constructed by assigning each node Xn keys selected uniformly at random from a pool of Yn keys and then putting an undirected edge between any two nodes sharing at least one key. Considerable progress has been made in the literature to analyze connectivity and k-connectivity of random key graphs; e.g., Yagan and Makowski [ISIT '09, Trans. IT'12] on connectivity under Xn = Ω( √ ln n ), Rybarczyk [Discrete Mathematics '11] on connectivity under Xn ≥ 2, and our recent work [CDC '14] on k-connectivity under Xn = Ω( √ ln n ), where k-connectivity of a graph ensures connectivity even after the removal of k nodes or k edges. Yet, it still remains an open question for k-connectivity in random key graphs under Xn ≥ 2 and Xn = o( √ ln n ) (the case of Xn = 1 is trivial). In this paper, we answer the above problem by providing an exact analysis of k-connectivity in random key graphs under Xn ≥ 2.<h1>sections</h1><h2>heading</h2>I. INTRODUCTION<h2>text</h2>Random key graphs, also known as homogeneous random intersection graphs, have been investigated widely in the literature [1], [2], [5]- [7], [9], [10], [12], [13]. The notion of random key graph results from the seminal Eschenauer-Gligor (EG) random key predistribution scheme [4], which is the most recognized solution to secure communication using cryptographic keys in wireless sensor networks [10]. The definition of a random key graph can also be generalized beyond cryptographic keys. Consider a random key graph G(n, X n , Y n ) that is constructed on a set of n nodes as follows. Each node is independently assigned a set of\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}}
