FIS<h2>text</h2>Basically, fuzzy logic is intended to deal with real-world applications through framework able to deal with ambiguity and inaccuracy [19]. In fuzzy logic, quantified rules or statements are adopted to avoid firm true or false decisions. Accordingly, fuzzy logic sets grant objects values that range from 0 to 1 through graded memberships. Therefore, FIS maps sets of given inputs to outputs with the aid of fuzzy logic. Fig. 1 iDriveSense system architecture Fig. 2 FIS system Structure.\nIn addition, FIS dynamic performance is modeled by sets of linguistic descriptive rules that are set according to the system designer prior knowledge [19]. For example, the fuzzy rules of a multiple-input-single-output (MISO) fuzzy system are given by\nR1: if (a) is X1 and (b) is Y1, then (c) is Z1; R2: if (a) is X2 and (b) is Y2, then (c) is Z2;(1)\n……….\nRn: if (a) is Xn and (b) is Yn, then (c) is Zn;\nAs a, b and c are linguistic variables representing two inputs process state variables and one output variable. While, Xi and Yi are linguistic values of the linguistic a, b in the universe of discourse U and V with i = 1, 2, … , n. The linguistics values Zi of the linguistic variable c in the universe of discourse W in case of Mamdani FIS [20].\nFundamentally, as shown in fig. 2, four components together represent the FIS. The fuzzy rules which can be called \"IF-THEN\" are built according to the prior knowledge of the required system. Also, the input domain crisp values U are outlined with fuzzy sets defined in the same universe of disclosure by the aid the fuzzification stage. On the other hand, an inverted operation is carried by the defuzzification stage to map the crisp values of the output domain V with the predefined fuzzy sets. Further details on FIS structure and derivations can be found in [21].<h2>publication_ref</h2>['b18', 'b18', 'b19', 'b20']<h2>figure_ref</h2>[]<h2>table_ref</h2>[]<h2>heading</h2>B. Road Segment Assesment FIS<h2>text</h2>For road segment assessments, inputs from the road surface types and conditions data sets are used to compute three inputs for the FIS. The first input is the related to the total number of road anomalies in a given road segment 𝑆. For each segment, a normalized percentage of road anomalies 𝑅𝐴 is computed simple through dividing the total number of anomalies over 𝑆 to reflect the density of the anomalies in particular segment. Thus this input is mapped to three membership functions which are defined as low, moderate and high. As shown in fig. 3 we adopted sigmoidal membership function for both low and high functions. A sigmoidal function is a mapping on input vector 𝑎, and can be represented by:\n𝑓(𝑎, 𝑚, 𝑛) = 1 1+exp(-𝑚(𝑎-𝑛)) (2)\nWhere the sigmoidal membership functions innately open to the right or left according to the sign of the parameter 𝑚 and 𝑛 is a control parameter. The product of two sigmoidal functions is used in the moderate function and is given by: 𝑓 𝑘 (𝑎) = Given that 𝑘 = 1,2 and the parameters 𝑚 1 and 𝑚 2 command the left and right curves slopes and these two parameters have to be positive and negative, respectively. While 𝑛 1 and 𝑛 2 control the left and right curves points of inflection.\nThe second input is representing the effect of the anomalies severity level on the assessment of a road segment. As the road segments with equal lengths and have the same density of anomalies should not receive the same assessment decision if they experience different types of anomalies with different levels of severity. Accordingly, the average percentage of anomalies severity level in each segment is calculated and normalized concerning the segment length and presented by mild and severe sigmoid membership functions. Lastly, the third input is to distinguish road segments of single and double lanes. This input was chosen to represent the significance of the road segment wideness on its quality assessment. The road segments with multi-lanes allow the driver to maneuver before the anomalies easily while this is difficult to occur in single road segments and it can lead to dangerous scenarios within the two ways road segments. The third input is also mapped through two sigmoid wide and narrow membership functions. In this FIS, the fuzzification of the inputs is mapped by 11 Mamdani fuzzy rules. The road assessment FIS is then defuzzified to enable three output levels of road segment quality. They are classified into Good, Moderate and poor segments. <h2>publication_ref</h2>[]<h2>figure_ref</h2>['fig_0']<h2>table_ref</h2>[]<h2>heading</h2>C.
