Section 3.4) and produces an ordered sequence of patches (f r cmd (patches) = seq r cmd ∈ P k ). We propose the following heuristics to re-prioritize the patch candidates:\n(1) [Minimal changes]: we favor patches that minimize the differences between the patched program and the buggy program. To that end, patches are ordered following their AST edit script sizes. Formally, we define pri chanдe : 2\nP → P n where n = |patches |, pri chanдe (patches) = [p i , p i+1 , p i+2 , • • • ] and holds ∀p ∈ patches, C chanдe (p i ) ≤ C chanдe (p i+1 ).\nHere, C chanдe (p) is a function that counts the number of deleted and inserted AST nodes by the change actions of p.\n(2) [Fault localization suspiciousness]: when two patch candidates have equal edit script sizes, the tie is broken by using the suspiciousness scores (of the associated statements) yielded during IR-based fault localization. Thus, when C chanдe (p i ) == C chanдe (p i+1 ), pri susp re-orders the two patch candidates. We define pri susp :\nP n → P n such that pri susp (seq chanдe ) = [• • • , p i , p i+1 , • • • ] holds S susp (p i ) ≥ S susp (p i+1 )\n, where seq chanдe is the result of pri chanдe and S susp returns a suspicious score of the statement that a given patch p i changes. (3) [Affected code elements]: after a manual analysis of fix patterns and the performance of associated APR in the literature, we empirically found that some change actions are irrelevant to bug fixing. Thus, for the corresponding pre-defined patterns, iFixR systematically under-prioritizes their generated patches against any other patches, although among themselves the ranking obtained so far (through pri chanдe and pri susp ) is preserved for those under-prioritized patches. These are patches generated by (i) mutating a literal expression, (ii) mutating a variable into a method invocation or a final static variable, or (iii) inserting a method invocation without parameter. This prioritization, is defined by pri type : P n → P k , which returns a sequence of top k ordered patches (k ≤ n = |patches |). To define this prioritization function, we assign natural numbers j 1 , j 2 , j 3 , j 4 ∈ N to each patch generation types (i.e., j 1 ←(i), j 2 ←(ii), and j 3 ←(iii), respectively) and (j 4 ←) everything else, which strictly hold j 4 > j 1 , j 4 > j 2 , j 4 > j 3 . This prioritization function takes the result of pri susp and returns another sequence\n[p i , p i+1 , p i+2 , • • • ] that holds ∀p i , D type (p i ) ≥ D type (p i+1\n). D type is defined as D type : 2 P → {j 1 , j 2 , j 3 , j 4 } and determines how a patch p i has been generated as defined above. From the ordered sequence, the function returns the leftmost (i.e., top) k patches as a result.<h2>publication_ref</h2>['b47']<h2>figure_ref</h2>[]<h2>table_ref</h2>[]<h2>heading</h2>EXPERIMENTAL SETUP<h2>text</h2>We now provide details on the experiments that we carry out to assess the iFixR patch generation pipeline for user-reported bugs. Notably, we discuss the dataset and benchmark, some implementation details before enumerating the research questions.<h2>publication_ref</h2>[]<h2>figure_ref</h2>[]<h2>table_ref</h2>[]<h2>heading</h2>Dataset & Benchmark<h2>text</h2>To evaluate iFixR we propose to rely on the Defects4J [21] dataset which is widely used as a benchmark in the Java APR literature. Nevertheless, given that Defects4J does not provide direct links to the bug reports that are associated with the benchmark bugs, we must undertake a fairly accurate bug linking task [78]. Furthermore, to realistically evaluate iFixR, we must reorganize the dataset test suites to accurately simulate the context at the time the bug report is submitted by users.<h2>publication_ref</h2>['b20', 'b77']<h2>figure_ref</h2>[]<h2>table_ref</h2>[]<h2>heading</h2>Bug linking.<h2>text</h2>To identify the bug report describing a given bug in the Defects4J dataset we focus on recovering the links between the bug fix commits and bug reports from the issue tracking system. Unfortunately, projects Joda-Time, JFreeChart and Closure have migrated their source code repositories and issue tracking systems into GitHub without a proper reassignment of bug report identifiers. Therefore, for these projects, bug IDs referred to in the commit logs are ambiguous (for some bugs this may match with the GitHub issue tracking numbering, while in others, it refers to the original issue tracker). To avoid introducing noise in our validation data, we simply drop these projects.
