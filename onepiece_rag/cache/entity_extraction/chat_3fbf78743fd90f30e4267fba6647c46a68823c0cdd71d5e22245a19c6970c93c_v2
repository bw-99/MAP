Overall, subjects reported the iQUANT interface to be user-friendly, as our design was similar to their familiar and popular tools. Some experts even commented that our design could be part of standard stock market analysis tools (e.g., the work from Bloomberg [SB13]).\nOn the other hand, it was suggested that the interface could incorporate more statistical information according to the industry standard (e.g., the change of stock holdings in the backtesting view). The Voronoi map for top-5 factors could be reduced to only show the top-3 or less, in order to better reveal the most salient signal for the stock market. More detailed visual encoding could be applied to distinguish the factors of the same type, which are now depicted in the same color. Notably, we thought the complexity of the interface could raise learning issues. During the study, most subjects could be well prepared after a 10-minute training session, as indicated by the high task accuracy in applying iQUANT. </p><h2>publication_ref</h2> <p>[] </p><h2>figure_ref</h2> <p>[] </p><h2>table_ref</h2> <p>[] </p><h2>heading</h2> <p>Case Study </p><h2>text</h2> <p> </p><h2>publication_ref</h2> <p>[] </p><h2>figure_ref</h2> <p>[] </p><h2>table_ref</h2> <p>[] </p><h2>heading</h2> <p>Selection of Investment Time </p><h2>text</h2> <p>We first invited a fund manager to select the best investment time for individual stock with iQUANT. He looked at the year of 2016.2-2017.1 when the market index rose by 15.7%. From a list of candidates, the manager examined each stock until a feasible investment time for excess return is identified.\nThe manager reported stock in the Computer sector (code: 002351.SZ) for which the composite index of the whole sector rose by 2.5%. In his analysis, the Lasso model was selected. As shown in Figure 5(a1), the initial factor view displays a summary of important factors recommended by the Lasso model. In the factor list view (Figure 5(a2)), the manager identified several useful factors having large contribution to the stock return. He hovered these factors one by one to examine their performance in the given period. The AM factor (asset-to-market ratio) was chosen because its contributions are stable in the first six months: all negative to the rise of stock prices. There are two months when the factor sen- sitivity is high, as indicated by opaque colors. By this one-factor model, the investment return (red curve in Figure 5(a3)) surpasses the stock price change (blue curve) by 26.5% at the end of the period. A maximal return of 11% can also be forecast for the next three months, as shown by the grey dotted curve in the backtesting view of Figure 5(a4). Notably, the manager suggested applying the model from June when the AM factor has been stable for four months and enjoys a high sensitivity in the latest month (May). In case this strategy was adopted, an excess return of 39.1% could be earned in June when the overall market only rose by 1.6%.\nTo optimize the investment for the whole year, the manager explored other factors that can characterize the price change in the second half of the year. He found that the volumed factor was complementary to AM, as the volumed factor contributed to the model mainly from July (Figure 5(b1)). By applying a AM+volumed twofactor model, a return of 81.8% can be obtained by the end of the period, which is 14.5% more than the one-factor model (Figure 5(b3)). Notably, the predicted return for the next three months increases to 40.9% with the new model (Figure 5(b4)). </p><h2>publication_ref</h2> <p>[] </p><h2>figure_ref</h2> <p>['fig_6', 'fig_6', 'fig_6', 'fig_6', 'fig_6', 'fig_6'] </p><h2>table_ref</h2> <p>[] </p><h2>heading</h2> <p>Selection of Stock Portfolio </p><h2>text</h2> <p>In the second scenario, we invited the fund manager to select a portfolio of stocks to invest from an initial stock pool in a given time period. The sector-based division was adopted. The manager analyzed every candidate sector, and combined the selected stocks in each sector into a final portfolio for investment. The year of 2015 was considered when the market experienced a spike with the maximal index climbing as high as 60% in the first six months. The yearly growth was 9.4% after the downturn in the second half of the year. It is thus an appropriate scenario to test whether our tool can improve factor investing even in rapidly changing markets.\nThe manager first studied the Chemical sector which had a similar trend to the market in 2015. The factor view in Figure 2(b) visualizes an initial collection of factors using the ELNetApp model. It can be seen in the factor view that many factors are quite stable over time.
