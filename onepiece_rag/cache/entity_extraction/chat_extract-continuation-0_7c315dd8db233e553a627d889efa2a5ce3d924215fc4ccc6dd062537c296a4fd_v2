Meanwhile, to demonstrate the capability of feature selection from noisy fields, we augment the number of fields in the two datasets by brute-forcing all cross fields, yielding 39 + C 2 39 = 780 fields in Criteo and 24 + C 2 24 = 300 fields in Avazu. We renamed the new datasets as Criteo-FG and Avazu-FG. Some key statistics of the aforementioned datasets are summarized in Table 1.  L1 and L2 control the weights of the L1-norm and L2-norm loss respectively; TopK represents the field search space, where each element means the retention of the topK fields; τ is the temperature; λ is the parameter that controls the weight of the regularization term L p ; cpt is the threshold in the retraining stage. </p><h2>publication_ref</h2> <p>['b35', 'b44'] </p><h2>figure_ref</h2> <p>[] </p><h2>table_ref</h2> <p>['tab_2'] </p><h2>heading</h2> <p>Experimental Setup </p><h2>text</h2> <p> </p><h2>publication_ref</h2> <p>[] </p><h2>figure_ref</h2> <p>[] </p><h2>table_ref</h2> <p>[] </p><h2>heading</h2> <p>Baselines </p><h2>text</h2> <p>To evaluate the effectiveness of i-Razor, we select the following state-of-the-art methods as baselines:\n1) Feature selection methods. Fixed dimension embedding (FDE) specifies a uniform dimension size for all fields via traversal search and is paired with all feature selection methods to test the effectiveness of feature selection alone. FTRL [50] is a widely used feature selection algorithm that incorporates L1 and L2 regularization and has excellent sparsity and convergence properties. AutoField [37] is an AutoML framework that can adaptively evaluate the inclusion/exclusion probability for each feature. Following the experimental setup in the original paper, we evaluated model performance by keeping varying numbers of features and identified the configuration that achieved the best performance. AdaFS [38] employs a control network to score input data samples and adaptively select the most informative features. Mirroring AdaFS-hard [38] in the original study, we performed hard feature selection to retain different proportions of features in order of importance and discarded the remainder. AutoFIS [36] is a state-of-theart method to select important feature interactions in FMbased methods 5 . Notice that we tried different deletion ratios ranging from 0 to 1 with an interval of 0.1, and only presented the best results with the highest AUC metric. The feature selection performance of i-Razor is evaluated by just removing the fields dominated by dimension 0. 2) Dimension search methods. AutoDim [19] and DARTS [17] are two state-of-the-art methods that bear the closest resemblance to i-Razor and can automatically select appropriate dimensions for different fields. Both methods perform dimension search directly on all fields without feature selection to evaluate the validity of naive dimension optimization. Unlike AutoDim [19] and i-Razor, different dimension candidates in DARTS [17] do not share dimension blocks with each other. DARTS needs to allocate total K j=1 D j dimensions to each field in the pretraining model and relies on the argmax operator as Autodim for dimension selection.\n3) Hybrid methods. In addition to our approach, we compare the training mechanism of feature selection followed by dimension search, and the corresponding baselines are designated as 'AutoFIS w/ AutoDim' and 'AutoFIS w/ i-Razor'. </p><h2>publication_ref</h2> <p>['b49', 'b36', 'b37', 'b37', 'b35', 'b18', 'b16', 'b18', 'b16'] </p><h2>figure_ref</h2> <p>[] </p><h2>table_ref</h2> <p>[] </p><h2>heading</h2> <p>Evaluation Metrics </p><h2>text</h2> <p>We evaluate the performance of our proposed method on the classical CTR prediction task. The evaluation metrics include Area Under the ROC Curve (AUC), the number of selected fields (Fields), the total embedding dimensions used in the retraining stage (Dims), and the parameter quantity of all embeddings (Params) 6 . A higher AUC indicates a better recommendation performance. It is noteworthy that a slightly higher AUC at 0.001-level is regarded as significant for the CTR prediction task [19], [51]. We naturally introduce Dims and Fields as straightforward metrics since all methods aim to reduce model parameters through feature selection or dimension search. </p><h2>publication_ref</h2> <p>['b18', 'b50'] </p><h2>figure_ref</h2> <p>[] </p><h2>table_ref</h2> <p>[] </p><h2>heading</h2> <p>Implementation </p><h2>text</h2> <p>We implement all algorithms in Tensorflow [52] and use the Adagrad [53] optimizer for gradient descent.\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>CRITEO<|>CONCEPT<|>Criteo is a dataset used for evaluating machine learning models, particularly in the context of click-through rate (CTR) prediction, which has 780 fields after augmentation.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>AVAZU<|>CONCEPT<|>Avazu is another dataset used for machine learning evaluation, specifically in CTR prediction, which has 300 fields after augmentation.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>I-RAZOR<|>CONCEPT<|>i-Razor is a proposed method for feature selection and dimension search in machine learning models, particularly for CTR prediction tasks.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>AUTOFIS<|>CONCEPT<|>AutoFIS is a state-of-the-art method for selecting important feature interactions in factorization machine-based methods.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>FTRL<|>CONCEPT<|>FTRL is a widely used feature selection algorithm that incorporates L1 and L2 regularization, known for its sparsity and convergence properties.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>AUTOFIELD<|>CONCEPT<|>AutoField is an AutoML framework that adaptively evaluates the inclusion/exclusion probability for each feature in machine learning models.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ADAFS<|>CONCEPT<|>AdaFS is a method that employs a control network to score input data samples and adaptively select the most informative features.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DARTS<|>CONCEPT<|>DARTS is a method for dimension search that automatically selects appropriate dimensions for different fields in machine learning models.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>AUTODIM<|>CONCEPT<|>AutoDim is a method that performs dimension search directly on all fields without feature selection to evaluate naive dimension optimization.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>AUC<|>CONCEPT<|>Area Under the ROC Curve (AUC) is a performance metric used to evaluate the effectiveness of machine learning models, particularly in CTR prediction.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>I-RAZOR<|>AUTOFIS<|>i-Razor is a proposed method that builds upon the principles of AutoFIS for feature selection and dimension search in CTR prediction tasks.<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CRITEO<|>I-RAZOR<|>i-Razor is evaluated using the Criteo dataset for its effectiveness in feature selection and dimension search.<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>AVAZU<|>I-RAZOR<|>i-Razor is also evaluated using the Avazu dataset for its effectiveness in feature selection and dimension search.<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>FTRL<|>AUTOFIS<|>FTRL is one of the baseline feature selection methods compared against AutoFIS in the evaluation of i-Razor.<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>AUTOFIELD<|>I-RAZOR<|>AutoField is another method that is compared with i-Razor in the context of feature selection and dimension search.<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ADAFS<|>I-RAZOR<|>AdaFS is compared with i-Razor to evaluate the effectiveness of feature selection methods in the context of CTR prediction.<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>DARTS<|>I-RAZOR<|>DARTS is compared with i-Razor to evaluate dimension search methods in the context of CTR prediction.<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>AUTODIM<|>I-RAZOR<|>AutoDim is compared with i-Razor to evaluate dimension search methods in the context of CTR prediction.<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>AUC<|>I-RAZOR<|>The performance of i-Razor is evaluated using AUC as a key metric for CTR prediction effectiveness.<|>9)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
