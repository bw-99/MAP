AUC refers to the area under the ROC curve, which means the probability that a model will rank a randomly selected positive instance higher than a randomly selected negative one. A higher AUC value indicates superior model performance. On the other hand, Logloss, aka binary cross-entropy loss, directly quantifies the model's performance, with a lower score denoting more accurate predictions. Note that a marginal 0.001-level improvement in AUC (increase) or Logloss (decrease) is perceived as a significant enhancement in model performance [19,33,37]. </p><h2>publication_ref</h2> <p>['b16', 'b24', 'b18', 'b32', 'b36'] </p><h2>figure_ref</h2> <p>[] </p><h2>table_ref</h2> <p>[] </p><h2>heading</h2> <p>Baseline Methods </p><h2>text</h2> <p>We compare our proposed method with the following state-of-theart methods:\n• PEP [17]: It adopts trainable thresholds to prune redundant embedding dimensions. • AutoField [33]: It utilizes neural architecture search techniques [16] to select important field features. • OptEmbed [20]: It trains a supernet with various selected embedding dimensions, then uses evolution search to find the optimal embedding dimensions based on the supernet. • AdaFS [15]: It assigns weights to different fields in a soft manner (AdaFS-soft) or masks unimportant fields in a hard manner (AdaFS-hard) via a novel controller network. • OptFS [19]: It simultaneously selects optimal field features and the optimal interactions between these features using \"binary gates\". </p><h2>publication_ref</h2> <p>['b16', 'b32', 'b15', 'b19', 'b14', 'b18'] </p><h2>figure_ref</h2> <p>[] </p><h2>table_ref</h2> <p>[] </p><h2>heading</h2> <p>Implementation Details </p><h2>text</h2> <p>We implement our method based on a public libraryfoot_0 that involves sixteen commonly-used DLRMs. As our framework is modelagnostic, it can be seamlessly integrated with any of these models, see Section 4.6. For the embedding layer, we set the initial embedding size of all fields as 16 in accordance with the previous works [15,33]. For the MLP component, we adopt two fully-connected layers of size (16,8) with the ReLU activation function. We use Adam optimizer [13] with an initial learning rate of 0.001, and weight decay of 1e-6. The batch size is set to 2048. We sample one validation batch every 100 training batches for bi-level optimization.\nThe temperature 𝜏 for ST Gumbel-Softmax is set to 0.1. The baseline models are implemented by the codes provided by their authors. For a fair comparison, we set the initial embedding dimension as 16 for all baselines. All the experiments are run on a single machine with an Nvidia RTX 3090 GPU.  First, our iHAS outperforms all the state-of-the-art baseline methods as it can achieve higher AUC and lower Logloss on both datasets, demonstrating the effectiveness of iHAS in deep recommendation systems. Specifically, iHAS outperforms the runner-ups by 0.0038 (AUC) and 0.0021 (Logloss) on the Avazu datasets, and by 0.0004 (AUC) and 0.0006 (Logloss) on the Criteo datasets.\nSecondly, among all baselines, AdaFS-soft is the most effective model for the Avazu and Criteo datasets. However, it only shrinks the field features using a feature weighting layer and therefore does not completely eliminate the effect of unimportant fields. Although AdaFS-hard attempts to mask unimportant fields by uniformly keeping the top 𝐾 features, the trained feature weights may still exhibit a high variance pattern (remember the non-distinguishable probabilities in Figure 3, left panel). Therefore, this top 𝐾 selection manner may lead to selecting unimportant features or omitting the important feature in their final model, further compromising the model performance. Our polarization regularizer and threshold searcher can help with this issue,\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>CRITEO DATASET<|>CONCEPT<|>The Criteo dataset consists of 46 million users' click records on display ads, containing 26 categorical fields and 13 numerical fields, used for evaluating ad performance.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>AVAZU DATASET<|>CONCEPT<|>The Avazu dataset is a collection of click records used for predicting click-through rates in online advertising, serving as a benchmark for model evaluation.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>AUC<|>CONCEPT<|>AUC, or Area Under the ROC Curve, is a performance metric that indicates the probability that a model will rank a randomly selected positive instance higher than a randomly selected negative one.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LOGLOSS<|>CONCEPT<|>Logloss, also known as binary cross-entropy loss, quantifies the performance of a model, with lower scores indicating more accurate predictions.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>IHAS<|>CONCEPT<|>iHAS is a proposed method that outperforms state-of-the-art baseline methods in deep recommendation systems, achieving higher AUC and lower Logloss.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PEP<|>ORGANIZATION<|>PEP is a baseline method that adopts trainable thresholds to prune redundant embedding dimensions in machine learning models.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>AUTOFIELD<|>ORGANIZATION<|>AutoField is a baseline method that utilizes neural architecture search techniques to select important field features in machine learning models.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>OPTEMBED<|>ORGANIZATION<|>OptEmbed is a baseline method that trains a supernet with various selected embedding dimensions to find the optimal dimensions based on the supernet.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ADAFS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>AdaFS is a baseline method that assigns weights to different fields in a soft or hard manner via a novel controller network.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>OPTFS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>OptFS is a baseline method that simultaneously selects optimal field features and the optimal interactions between these features using binary gates.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>IHAS<|>AVAZU DATASET<|>iHAS outperforms all state-of-the-art baseline methods on the Avazu dataset, demonstrating its effectiveness in deep recommendation systems<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>IHAS<|>CRITEO DATASET<|>iHAS outperforms all state-of-the-art baseline methods on the Criteo dataset, demonstrating its effectiveness in deep recommendation systems<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>IHAS<|>AUC<|>iHAS achieves higher AUC values compared to baseline methods, indicating superior model performance<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>IHAS<|>LOGLOSS<|>iHAS achieves lower Logloss values compared to baseline methods, indicating more accurate predictions<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PEP<|>IHAS<|>PEP is one of the baseline methods that iHAS is compared against in terms of performance<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>AUTOFIELD<|>IHAS<|>AutoField is one of the baseline methods that iHAS is compared against in terms of performance<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>OPTEMBED<|>IHAS<|>OptEmbed is one of the baseline methods that iHAS is compared against in terms of performance<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ADAFS<|>IHAS<|>AdaFS is one of the baseline methods that iHAS is compared against in terms of performance<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>OPTFS<|>IHAS<|>OptFS is one of the baseline methods that iHAS is compared against in terms of performance<|>5)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
