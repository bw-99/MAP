We compare the performance of the proposed paper2repo with the competing methods. Fig. 5 illustrates the comparison results of different methods as K increases with three measures: HR@K, MRR@K and MAP@K. We can observe that the proposed paper2repo outperforms the other recommendation algorithms for all the three metrics. This is because our paper2repo encodes both the contents and graph structures of papers and repositories to learn their embeddings. In addition, paper2repo performs better than the cross-domain NCSR algorithm for two reasons. First of all, NCSR leverages spectral embeddings method without using node features in social domain, while our model encodes both content information and graph structures. Secondly, the items in our data sets have more attributes (keywords and tags) than that (20 attributes) in the NCSR paper, making it hard to train the NCSR model. In Fig. 5(c), we also find that the MAP of paper2repo slightly drops. This reason is that more positive repositories are recommended but not at the top of ranking list, leading to lower MAP. Moreover, we can observe that CDL and NCF do not perform well in our case.\nThe main reason is that the number of positive examples for model training is very small such that they suffer from data sparsity as the traditional MF. Besides, KGCN does not work very well because it only adopts one hot embedding without taking node features into account in the paper domain.<h2>publication_ref</h2>[]<h2>figure_ref</h2>['fig_6', 'fig_6']<h2>table_ref</h2>[]<h2>heading</h2>Performance on Larger Data Sets<h2>text</h2>We conduct another experiment to evaluate the performance of the paper2repo on larger data sets. We do not otherwise perform any data-set-specific tuning. We change the number of papers from 11, 272 to 32, 029, and the number of pairs of bridge papers and their original repositories from 1, 386 to 2, 107. Fig. 6 illustrates the comparison results for two different sizes of data sets. From this figure, it can be observed that the proposed paper2repo performs better on larger data sets than that on small data sets in terms of MAP and MRR, and their hit ratios are comparable. The is because our model can learn more information from different nodes in a large-scale graph.<h2>publication_ref</h2>[]<h2>figure_ref</h2>['fig_7']<h2>table_ref</h2>[]<h2>heading</h2>Ablation Studies<h2>text</h2>Effect of Pre-trained Embeddings. We first explore how the settings of pre-trained embeddings impact the performance of the proposed paper2repo. We compare three different cases: (i) fixed pre-trained embeddings; (ii) pre-trained embeddings are used as initialization (not fixed); (iii) fixed and not fixed embeddings are concatenated together. Table 3 illustrates the comparison results for these three cases when K = 10. We can see that when the pretrained embeddings are fixed, it performs better than the other two cases. The main reason is that the pre-trained embeddings are produced from the large Wikipedia corpus by GloVe. The performance of concatenated embeddings seems not very good, because it is more difficult to train the model with more complicated networks. Effect of top T positive repositories . Next, we explore how the number of positive repositories in training, T , influences the performance of paper2repo. In our experiment, the number of positive repositories, T , varies from 3 to 7 with step 1. From Table 4, it can be seen that the performance of paper2repo gradually boosts as T increases from 3 to 6. When T = 6 and 7, their performance are close to each other. Thus, we can find that paper2repo has a better performance when the number of positive repositories in training is large in some degree. In this paper, we use T = 6 to do experiments because most of papers in the testing data labelled by graders have at most 6 positive examples.\nEffect of the Margin Hyper-parameter. We also study the impact of the margin hyper-parameter on the performance of the paper2repo. We change the margin parameter, ∆, from 0.1 to 0.7 with step 0.1 while keeping the other hyper-parameters unchanged.  We further discuss the advantages and disadvantages of pape2repo.\nAccording to our experiments, we discover that the recommended repositories are relevant to a query paper when there exists substantial user co-starring between bridge repositories and other repositories or when there are multiple overlapped tags between them. The main reason is that two repositories starred by many of the same users or that have multiple overlapped keywords are very likely to involve similar research topics. However, when only few users star both repositories, the recommendation performance is not very good. For example, when two repositories are only starred by a couple of users together, it is hard to judge whether these two repositories are similar or not. As a result, the recommended repositories seem not to be very relevant to the query papers. The need to find a sufficient number of bridge repositories is another limitation. Extensions of this joint embedding framework to domains with no natural analogue to bridge papers/repositories can be a good topic for future investigation. Cold start is one of the most important research topics in recommender systems. As we know, when users release new source code, their repositories have\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}}
