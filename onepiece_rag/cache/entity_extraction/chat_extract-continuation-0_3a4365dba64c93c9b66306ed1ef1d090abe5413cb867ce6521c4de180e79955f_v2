For instance, DeepCoNN [50] utilized the TextCNN [3] to encode features and generate user and item embeddings for rating prediction. In order to differentiate the importance of different reviews, the attention mechanism [37] has also been introduced to improve review-based recommendation performance.\nIn some studies such as NARRE [2], after the feature extraction by CNN, attention is employed to select important reviews in learning user and item representations, improving model interpretability. HUITA [44] designs a three-hierarchy attention mechanism to leverage word-level, sentence-level, and review-level information in user reviews. We can also concatenate all reviews generated by a single user into a long document, for instance, NRCA [22] integrates the document-level and review-level modeling for learning better representations. Last but not least, previous studies such as RGCL [34] also combine the review information during the propagation of the graph-based model. It employs user reviews to interact with the corresponding users and items, and the rating-specific weights, to further get better representations for rating prediction tasks. In summary, from the aforementioned previous works, it is evident that user reviews play a crucial role in recommendation scenarios.<h2>publication_ref</h2>['b5', 'b13', 'b6', 'b27', 'b36', 'b3', 'b26', 'b18', 'b23', 'b17', 'b16', 'b1', 'b4', 'b10', 'b19', 'b32', 'b33', 'b42', 'b48', 'b49', 'b2', 'b36', 'b1', 'b43', 'b21', 'b33']<h2>figure_ref</h2>[]<h2>table_ref</h2>[]<h2>heading</h2>PRINTF FOR PREFERENCE MODELING 3.1 Overview<h2>text</h2>Referring to Figure 1, printf is composed of three main components, including (1) Cross-Modality Item Modeling (CMIM), (2) Review-Aware User Modeling (RAUM), and (3) User-Item Embedding Propagation and Interaction Modeling (EPIM). CMIM fine-tunes our cross-modality feature encoder to extract image and text representations for items. RAUM leverages user reviews to distill user interests and preferences. User reviews are treated as an indicator to derive user embeddings. Compared to previous methods, instead of using a vector-wise inner product operator to compute the attention scores, we propose to compute multiple dimension-wise attention scores to reflect diversified topics between user reviews and item contents. EPIM employs the state-of-the-art graph convolutional network to propagate user-item embeddings and model high-order connectivity of user-item interactions. Problem Statement. Suppose we have a user set U, an item set I, and the review matrix R, where the entry 𝑟 𝑢,𝑖 specifies the review written by the user 𝑢 ∈ U toward the item 𝑖 ∈ I. The observedinteractions list can be designated as E = {(𝑢, 𝑖, 𝑟 𝑢,𝑖 )|𝑢 ∈ U, 𝑖 ∈ I, 𝑟 𝑢,𝑖 ∈ R}, where each (𝑢, 𝑖, 𝑟 𝑢,𝑖 ) tuple represents an interaction between the user 𝑢 and the item 𝑖 with the corresponding review 𝑟 𝑢,𝑖 . Moreover, we have a set of item text contents T , and a set of item image contents M. For each item 𝑖 ∈ I, its corresponding textual and image contents are denoted as 𝑡 𝑖 ∈ T and 𝑚 𝑖 ∈ M respectively. The goal of our proposed model is to learn a function that can predict how likely a user will interact with an unseen item given interaction data E and item contents {T , M}. Note that since the review feature 𝑟 𝑢,𝑖 implies the positive interaction between the user 𝑢 ∈ U and the item 𝑖 ∈ I, the review feature of the given user toward the item 𝑟 𝑢,𝑖 will be not be fed into the model while making the prediction, i.e., inference stage.<h2>publication_ref</h2>[]<h2>figure_ref</h2>['fig_0']<h2>table_ref</h2>[]<h2>heading</h2>Cross-Modality Item Modeling (CMIM)<h2>text</h2>3.2.1 Cross-Modality Feature Alignment Encoder. Inspired by the ALBEF [18] model, we propose to leverage the image-text contrastive loss [15] and an additional multi-modal encoder to obtain aligned image and text representations. Specifically, a 12layer visual transformer [8] and a 6-layer BERT model [7] derive the image and text embeddings h 𝑣 𝑖 and h 𝑡 𝑖 . In the learning stage, the contrastive loss will align embeddings to each other while an additional 6-layer cross-attentive multi-modal encoder will enforce their multi-modality with self-supervised learning. The detailed loss functions can be found in Section 3.5.<h2>publication_ref</h2>['b17', 'b14', 'b7', 'b6']<h2>figure_ref</h2>[]<h2>table_ref</h2>[]<h2>heading</h2>Item Embedding Compressor\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>DEEPCONN<|>ORGANIZATION<|>DeepCoNN is a model that utilizes TextCNN to encode features and generate user and item embeddings for rating prediction in recommendation systems.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>NARRE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>NARRE is a model that employs attention mechanisms to select important reviews for learning user and item representations.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>HUITA<|>ORGANIZATION<|>HUITA is a model that designs a three-hierarchy attention mechanism to leverage word-level, sentence-level, and review-level information in user reviews.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>NRCA<|>ORGANIZATION<|>NRCA integrates document-level and review-level modeling for better representation learning in recommendation systems.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>RGCL<|>ORGANIZATION<|>RGCL is a model that combines review information during the propagation of a graph-based model for rating prediction tasks.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CROSS-MODALITY ITEM MODELING (CMIM)<|>EVENT<|>CMIM is an event that involves fine-tuning a cross-modality feature encoder to extract image and text representations for items.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>REVIEW-AWARE USER MODELING (RAUM)<|>EVENT<|>RAUM is an event that leverages user reviews to distill user interests and preferences.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>USER-ITEM EMBEDDING PROPAGATION AND INTERACTION MODELING (EPIM)<|>EVENT<|>EPIM is an event that employs a graph convolutional network to propagate user-item embeddings and model high-order connectivity of user-item interactions.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>DEEPCONN<|>NARRE<|>Both DeepCoNN and NARRE utilize attention mechanisms to improve recommendation performance through user and item embeddings<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>NARRE<|>HUITA<|>NARRE and HUITA both focus on enhancing user review modeling through attention mechanisms<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>HUITA<|>NRCA<|>HUITA and NRCA both aim to improve representation learning in recommendation systems through advanced modeling techniques<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>NRCA<|>RGCL<|>NRCA and RGCL both integrate review information to enhance user-item interactions in their respective models<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CROSS-MODALITY ITEM MODELING (CMIM)<|>REVIEW-AWARE USER MODELING (RAUM)<|>CMIM and RAUM are components of a larger model aimed at improving recommendation systems through different modalities<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>REVIEW-AWARE USER MODELING (RAUM)<|>USER-ITEM EMBEDDING PROPAGATION AND INTERACTION MODELING (EPIM)<|>RAUM and EPIM work together to enhance user-item interactions and user preferences in recommendation systems<|>8)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
