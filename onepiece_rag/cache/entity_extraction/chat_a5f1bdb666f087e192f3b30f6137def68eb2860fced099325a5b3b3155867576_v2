For notational brevity, since we define C max i (τ k,h ) and U max i (τ k,h ) by referring to τ k,h , we will simplify the notation by using C max i and U max i , respectively, for the rest of this section.\nSuppose that the last release of task τ i in the window of interest is at t i . We define the request bound function for such a case as follows:\nLemma 14. Task τ k,h in a multi-mode task system with constrained deadlines is schedulable by a mode-level fixed-priority scheduling algorithm on uniprocessor systems if\nProof: This is proved by contrapositive. Suppose that τ k,h misses its deadline firstly at time d k,h . We know that this job of τ k,h arrives to the system at time a 1 = d k,h -D k,h . Due to the scheduling policy, we know that the processor is busy executing jobs in hp(τ k,h ) (recall that τ k,h is also in hp(τ k,h )) from a 1 to d k,h . Let a 0 be the last time point in the above schedule before a 1 such that the processor is idle or executing any job with lower priority than τ k,h . It is clear that a 0 is well-defined. Therefore, the processor executes only jobs in hp(τ k,h ) from a 0 to d k,h . We denote a 1 -a 0 as y. Let the last release of the task modes of task τ i before d k,h be a 0 + t i . If task τ i does not have any release, we set t i to 0. Therefore, we have 0\nWithout loss of generality, we set a 0 to 0. Therefore, the workload requested by the modes of task τ i at any time t before (and at) t i is no more than load(i, t). Moreover, the workload released by the modes of task τ i at any time t after t i is no more than load(i, t i ) + C max i . As a result, the function rbf (i, t i , t) defined in Eq. ( 63) is a safe upper bound of the workload requested by task τ i upt to time t.\nBy the definition of the task model, task mode τ k,h and the other higher-priority task modes of task τ k may also release some workload before a 1 , in which the workload is upper bounded by load(k, y). The assumption of non-schedulability of task τ k,h in the above schedule and the busy execution in the interval (a 0 , d k,h ] implies that the above workload at any point t in the interval (a 0 , d k,h ] is larger than t. Therefore, we know that\nwhich concludes the proof by contrapositive.\nEvaluating load(i, t) is in fact equivalent to the unbounded knapsack problem (UKP). The UKP problem is to select some items in a collection of items with specified weights and profits so that the total weight of the selected items is less than or equal to a given limit (called knapsack) and total profit of the selected items is maximized, in which an item can be selected unbounded multiple times. The definition of load(i, t) is essentially an unbounded knapsack problem, by considering t as the knapsack constraint, the minimum inter-arrival time (period) of a task mode as the weight of an item, and the execution time of a task mode as the profit of the item. \nProof: It has been shown in [42] that an upper bound of the above unbounded knapsack problem is max τi,j ∈hp(τ k,h ) { Ci,j Ti,j } • t = U max i • t, which completes the proof.\nBy Lemma 14 and Lemma 15, we can now apply the k 2 Q </p><h2>publication_ref</h2> <p>['b0', 'b30', 'b41'] </p><h2>figure_ref</h2> <p>[] </p><h2>table_ref</h2> <p>[] </p><h1>references</h1><h2>ref_id</h2> <p>b0 </p><h2>title</h2> <p>A utilization bound for aperiodic tasks and priority driven scheduling </p><h2>journal</h2> <p>IEEE Trans.
