However, when cpt ≥ 0.4, the performance of the model will decrease significantly. The potential reason is that with more fields and embedding dimensions preserved, the DNN model may require more data to eliminate the side-effect of redundant parameters. Meanwhile, the experimental results indicate that larger λ usually corresponds to less Params, which reflects the effectiveness of L p in controlling the number of parameters. However, when L p dominates the gradient update of the architecture parameters, model performance tends to drop sharply since some useful embedding regions or fields with large cardinality may be incorrectly filtered out. In short, both cpt and λ are crucial hyperparameters in i-Razor, and we empirically find them to be effective and parameter insensitive when taking smaller values. In practical use, the appropriate values can be found by performing a grid search on recommended intervals: cpt ∈ [0, 0.4] and λ ∈ [0, 0.01].<h2>publication_ref</h2>[]<h2>figure_ref</h2>['fig_2']<h2>table_ref</h2>[]<h2>heading</h2>Candidate Dimension Set Study (RQ4)<h2>text</h2>In this subsection, we study how different dimension partitioning schemes for the candidate dimension sets affect model performance.

The result on Avazu-FG with the search space D = {0, 1, 2, 4, 6} is presented in Figure 5 as an example, and similar results obtained with other settings are omitted due to limited space. We can observe that important single fields such as \"site id\", \"app id\", and \"device ip\", generate many cross fields to be kept with. It makes sense since item features, context features and position features are essential features in recommender systems. For continuous fields, we can infer that \"C17\" and \"C20\" are relatively more important than others as they generate more effective cross fields. Meanwhile, we can directly pick out useful cross fields according to their derived embedding dimension size. For instance, \"site id * C14\", \"site domain * mday\", \"app category * device model\", and \"device model * C20\" are expected to be beneficial cross fields, since they are assigned with the largest dimension size. Furthermore, we can find the configuration matrix is sparse, where only 75 out of the 300 fields are\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}}
