The fixed-radius near neighbor search is amenable to the threshold-based match offered by the TCAM implementation, and reduces the total number of required operations. Algorithm-level evaluation will be presented in Sec. IV to study the effects of the adjustment on accuracy. We use a 256 LSH signature length which requires 2 CMAs to store a single entry. </p><h2>publication_ref</h2> <p>['b4'] </p><h2>figure_ref</h2> <p>[] </p><h2>table_ref</h2> <p>[] </p><h2>heading</h2> <p>C. RecSys Operation Mapping </p><h2>text</h2> <p>Given the iMARS architecture, careful mapping of the computation, how in Fig. 1 to iMARS is required in order to design the control sequence properly. The crossbars stored the trained weights of the DNN stack and the ItETs and UIETs store the trained ETs for the sparse feature vectors. Fig. 3 illustrates such a mapping where the labels (1a)-(2d*) indicates. We first discuss the operations in the filtering stage. (1a) The sparse features are sent to the corresponding ETs, i.e., UIETs and ItET for lookups and pooling. The embedding vectors of the features are obtained by looking up the stored ETs in the ItET CMAs and UIET CMAs using the RAM mode of the CMA. The retrieved embeddings are then aggregated (indicated by (1b*) in Fig. 3) by the in-memory adder, intramat and intra-bank adder trees. (1b) the dense features are sent to the pre-trained filtering sparse feature DNN stack which is implemented with the crossbar arrays. (1c) All features are then sent to the filtering DNN. The output of the filtering DNN is a user embedding vector (u i in Fig. 3). (1d) The user embedding vector is then sent to the ItET to retrieve the N nearest neighbors as candidate items inside the ItET CMAs. The indices of these retrieved (i.e., candidate) item embeddings are then stored in the item buffer (See (1d*) inf Fig. 3).\nWe now discuss the operations in the ranking stage. (2a) Each candidate item in the item buffer is then analyzed by the next steps with respect to the user's preferences. (2b) By using the item indices in the item buffer, their corresponding item embeddings are retrieved from the stored ET in the ItET and the ranking embeddings are retrieved in the stored ET in the ranking UIETs using the RAM mode. Note that some UIETs used in the filtering mode can be shared with the ranking stage. The item embeddings are pooled with the ranking embeddings either by concatenation or by an ADD operation using the in-memory adder, intra-bank and interbank adder trees. (See (2b*) in Fig. 3) The output forms a new set of embedding features. Together with the dense features are fed to the ranking DNN stack implemented in crossbars. (2c) the dense features are again obtained from the trained ranking DNN stack. (2d) The remaining crossbar arrays implement the ranking DNN with the pooled feature embeddings as input and return the click-through-rate (CTR) to the CTR buffer. The CTR buffer is a CMA that stores the CTR for each candidate item and the item index which are used for selecting the final top-k items. (2e) The CTR buffer then performs a topk operation using the threshold match mode of the CMA by searching a vector of all 1's (the maximum allowable CMA input). </p><h2>publication_ref</h2> <p>[] </p><h2>figure_ref</h2> <p>['fig_0', 'fig_2', 'fig_2', 'fig_2', 'fig_2', 'fig_2'] </p><h2>table_ref</h2> <p>[] </p><h2>heading</h2> <p>IV. EVALUATION </p><h2>text</h2> <p>We evaluated the RecSys implementations with two RecSys instances: (1) YoutubeDNN model [2] on the MovieLens 1M dataset, which includes both the filtering and ranking stage; (2) DLRM model [1] targeting at the ranking stage on the Criteo Kaggle dataset. The configurations of the two RecSys shown in Table I were implemented on Nvidia RTX 1080 GPU. We used the tools Nvidia-smi and lineprofiler to obtain energy and latency, respectively. We only compared with the GPU evaluation as other accelerators use older RecSys models and datasets.\nWe dimension B, M and C based on the largest dataset used in our evaluation (i.e., the Criteo Kaggle) with the configuration shown in Table . I. Each ET have different number of entries. In this configuration, the maximum size of the ETs in the Criteo Kaggle is 30,000 entries. Since each CMA has 256 rows, 118 CMAs are required to store the embedding table. The number of arrays is rounded up to the nearest power-oftwo value, i.e., 128. We choose C=32, which corresponds to 4 mats (M =4) working in parallel inside each bank, to have a balance between storing small and large ETs. The outputs from the 4 mats are accumulated at the bank level. Finally, the Criteo Kaggle dataset has 26 sparse\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>NEAR NEIGHBOR SEARCH<|>CONCEPT<|>Near neighbor search is a method used in data retrieval to find points in a dataset that are closest to a given point, often used in machine learning and data mining applications.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>TCAM IMPLEMENTATION<|>CONCEPT<|>TCAM (Ternary Content Addressable Memory) implementation refers to a specific hardware architecture that allows for fast searching and matching of data based on multiple criteria.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>IMARS ARCHITECTURE<|>CONCEPT<|>iMARS (Intelligent Memory Architecture for Recommender Systems) is a computational architecture designed to optimize the performance of recommendation systems through efficient data processing and storage.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>RECSYS<|>CONCEPT<|>RecSys (Recommendation Systems) are algorithms and systems designed to suggest relevant items to users based on their preferences and behaviors.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>YOUTUBEDNN MODEL<|>CONCEPT<|>YoutubeDNN model is a specific deep learning model used for recommendation tasks, particularly in video content recommendations on platforms like YouTube.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MOVIELENS 1M DATASET<|>CONCEPT<|>MovieLens 1M dataset is a widely used dataset in the field of recommendation systems, containing 1 million ratings from users on various movies.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DLRM MODEL<|>CONCEPT<|>DLRM (Deep Learning Recommendation Model) is a model designed for recommendation tasks, focusing on ranking items based on user interactions and preferences.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CRITEO KAGGLE DATASET<|>CONCEPT<|>Criteo Kaggle dataset is a large dataset used for benchmarking recommendation algorithms, particularly in the context of click-through rate prediction.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>NEAR NEIGHBOR SEARCH<|>TCAM IMPLEMENTATION<|>Near neighbor search is effectively implemented using TCAM to enhance the speed and efficiency of data retrieval operations<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>IMARS ARCHITECTURE<|>RECSYS<|>The iMARS architecture is designed to improve the performance of recommendation systems by optimizing computation and data handling<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>YOUTUBEDNN MODEL<|>MOVIELENS 1M DATASET<|>The YoutubeDNN model is evaluated using the MovieLens 1M dataset to assess its effectiveness in making recommendations<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>DLRM MODEL<|>CRITEO KAGGLE DATASET<|>The DLRM model is tested on the Criteo Kaggle dataset to measure its performance in ranking and recommendation tasks<|>6)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
