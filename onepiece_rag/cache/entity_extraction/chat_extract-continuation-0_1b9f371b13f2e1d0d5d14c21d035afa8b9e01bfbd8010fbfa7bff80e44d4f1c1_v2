To compute t(u, v), we first build up a reciprocal trust matrix Tr , whose (i, j)th cell tr (i, j) = 1/ t(i, j) if t(i, j) > 0; otherwise, set tr (i, j) = ‚àû. We treat the reciprocal trust matrix as a weighted directed graph G r . An exemplary show of the transformation from G to G r is presented in Fig. 3. Then we consider a shortest path problem [17], which aims to find the shortest path from u to v, denoted by SP r (u, v), in G r . The Dijkstra's algorithm [18] is employed here to find SP r (u, v).\nThen we set t(u, v) as follows\nt(u, v) = 1 M √ó L(SP r (u, v)) ,(7)\nwhere L(‚Ä¢) and M denote the length of a path and the number of nodes except the starting node included in the shortest path, respectively. For the sake of clarity, consider the case shown in the right graph of Fig. 3, for which the shortest path from u\nto v, SP r (u, v), is u ‚Üí k ‚Üí v, L(SP r (u, v)) = tr (u, k) + tr (k, v) = 4, M = 2 and thus t(u, v) = 1/8.\nIf the pattern of the trust information flow from u to v does not belong to any of the above mentioned categories, it then must belong to the 4th category, for which we set t(u, v) = 0. It is worth noting that, given T , the computation of t(u, v) for all cases included in the 1st, 3rd and 4th categories can be unified by a single formula as follows\nt(u, v) = 1 M √ó M-1 m=1 1 t(pm,pm+1) , (8\n)\nwhere  8), we can infer that, provided all the other conditions are the same, the bigger the value of M is or the smaller the value of t(p m , p m+1 ) is, the smaller the value of t(u, v) will be, and vice versa. The above effect is consistent with our intuitive understanding of the property of transitivity in the trust type relationships between a pair of users.\np 1 = u, p M = v and p 1 ‚Üí p 2 ‚Üí . . . ‚Üí p M is the shortest path in G r from u to v. </p><h2>publication_ref</h2> <p>['b16', 'b17'] </p><h2>figure_ref</h2> <p>['fig_1', 'fig_1'] </p><h2>table_ref</h2> <p>[] </p><h2>heading</h2> <p>Connections to related work </p><h2>text</h2> <p>The iTrace algorithm proposed here finds connections to several existent TaCF methods in the literature. The algorithm architecture of iTrace falls within a generic TaCF framework presented in [9], while the implicit inference procedure of iTrace presented here is unique. In a variety of existent TaCF methods [16,[19][20][21][22], the trust score is derived from the user rating data. To this regard, trust inference and the computation of user similarity are performed based on exactly the same information source. In contrast with the aforementioned work, the iTrace algorithm employs not only the user rating data but also data other than user rating, namely the explicit user trust data. Since the explicit trust data and the rating data are processed independently, the iTrace has the advantage of making full use of two complementary views in rating prediction. Furthermore, since the trust inference procedure can be performed offline prior to calculation of user similarity, the computation time of the iTrace for online rating predictions is similar to traditional CF methods. The iTrace algorithm also finds connections to our previous work on trust modeling in the context of wireless sensor networks [23][24][25]. Although the same term trust is used, its physical meaning is different. In iTrace, the term trust represents a classical social relationship among users, while in [23][24][25], it is an artificially designed concept related to abnormal sensory behaviors caused by sensor faults.\nTo our knowledge, the most similar work to our algorithm is a trust based CF method presented in [26], which has come to our attention only recently. In contrast with [26], we provide a new and more efficient way for readers to understand the shortest path based formulation of the trust inference problem by identifying four categories of trust information flow patterns and unifying three of them by a single formula, namely Eqn. (8). In addition, we consider two different ways, namely IW and LW as specified by Eqns.( 4) and ( 5), respectively, for fusion of trust and similarity; while in [26], only one way, i.e., LW, is considered. Further, the iTrace algorithm leverages the property of trust value attenuation in the trust propagation process by adding a penalization item M to the denominator of Eqn.( 7), while the method in [26] does not take into account of such attenuation effect. Finally, through a public open dataset, we demonstrate that our iTrace algorithm outperforms the method proposed in [26]. </p><h2>publication_ref</h2> <p>['b8', 'b15', 'b18', 'b19', 'b20', 'b21', 'b22', 'b23', 'b24',\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>RECIPROCAL TRUST MATRIX<|>concept<|>The reciprocal trust matrix is a mathematical representation used to quantify trust relationships between users, where each cell indicates the trust value between two users, adjusted based on certain conditions.)\n(\"entity\"<|>WEIGHTED DIRECTED GRAPH<|>concept<|>A weighted directed graph is a type of graph where edges have weights representing the strength or capacity of the connection, and the direction indicates the flow of trust or information.)\n(\"entity\"<|>DIJKSTRA'S ALGORITHM<|>concept<|>Dijkstra's algorithm is a well-known algorithm used to find the shortest paths between nodes in a graph, particularly in weighted graphs.)\n(\"entity\"<|>SHORTEST PATH<|>concept<|>The shortest path refers to the minimum distance or minimum number of edges required to travel from one node to another in a graph, denoted as SP r (u, v) in this context.)\n(\"entity\"<|>iTRACE ALGORITHM<|>concept<|>The iTrace algorithm is a method for trust inference that utilizes both user rating data and explicit user trust data to improve rating predictions in collaborative filtering.)\n(\"entity\"<|>USER RATING DATA<|>concept<|>User rating data consists of ratings given by users to items, which is used to derive trust scores and compute user similarity in collaborative filtering methods.)\n(\"entity\"<|>EXPLICIT USER TRUST DATA<|>concept<|>Explicit user trust data refers to direct trust relationships expressed by users, which can complement user rating data in trust inference processes.)\n(\"entity\"<|>TRUST INFERENCE<|>concept<|>Trust inference is the process of deducing trust values between users based on available data, which can include both ratings and explicit trust information.)\n(\"entity\"<|>TRUST PROPAGATION<|>concept<|>Trust propagation is the mechanism by which trust values are transferred or attenuated through a network of users, affecting how trust is perceived across connections.)\n(\"entity\"<|>TRUST BASED CF METHOD<|>concept<|>A trust-based collaborative filtering method is a recommendation approach that incorporates trust relationships among users to enhance the accuracy of predictions.)\n(\"relationship\"<|>RECIPROCAL TRUST MATRIX<|>WEIGHTED DIRECTED GRAPH<|>The reciprocal trust matrix is treated as a weighted directed graph to analyze trust relationships between users<|>8)\n(\"relationship\"<|>DIJKSTRA'S ALGORITHM<|>SHORTEST PATH<|>Dijkstra's algorithm is employed to find the shortest path in the weighted directed graph representing trust relationships<|>9)\n(\"relationship\"<|>iTRACE ALGORITHM<|>USER RATING DATA<|>The iTrace algorithm utilizes user rating data to derive trust scores and compute user similarity<|>8)\n(\"relationship\"<|>iTRACE ALGORITHM<|>EXPLICIT USER TRUST DATA<|>The iTrace algorithm incorporates explicit user trust data alongside user rating data for improved trust inference<|>9)\n(\"relationship\"<|>TRUST INFERENCE<|>iTRACE ALGORITHM<|>Trust inference is a key function of the iTrace algorithm, which aims to deduce trust values from available data<|>8)\n(\"relationship\"<|>TRUST PROPAGATION<|>TRUST INFERENCE<|>Trust propagation affects how trust values are inferred and perceived across the network of users<|>7)\n(\"relationship\"<|>TRUST BASED CF METHOD<|>iTRACE ALGORITHM<|>The iTrace algorithm is a specific implementation of a trust-based collaborative filtering method that enhances rating predictions<|>6) \n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
