To that end, we implemented iFixR, an APR pipeline variant adapted to the constraints of test cases unavailability when users report bugs. The proposed system revisits the fundamental steps, notably fault localization, patch generation and patch validation, which are all tightly-dependent to the positive test cases [83] in a test-based APR system.\nWithout making any assumptions on the availability of test cases, we demonstrate, after re-organizing the Defects4J benchmark, that iFixR can generate and recommend priority correct (and more plausible) patches for a diverse set of user-reported bugs. The repair performance of iFixR is even found to be comparable to that of the majority of test-based APR systems on the Defects4J dataset.\nWe open source iFixR's code and release all data of this study to facilitate replication and encourage further research in this direction which is promising for practical adoption in the software development community: https://github.com/SerVal-DTF/iFixR <h2>publication_ref</h2>['b82']<h2>figure_ref</h2>[]<h2>table_ref</h2>[]<h1>references</h1><h2>ref_id</h2>b0<h2>title</h2>D&C<h2>journal</h2><h2>year</h2>2019<h2>authors</h2><h2>ref_id</h2>b1<h2>title</h2>On the accuracy of spectrum-based fault localization<h2>journal</h2>IEEE<h2>year</h2>2007<h2>authors</h2>Rui Abreu; J C Arjan; Peter Van Gemund;  Zoeteweij<h2>ref_id</h2>b2<h2>title</h2>A practical evaluation of spectrum-based fault localization<h2>journal</h2>JSS<h2>year</h2>2009<h2>authors</h2>Rui Abreu; Peter Zoeteweij; Rob Golsteijn; Arjan Jc Van Gemund<h2>ref_id</h2>b3<h2>title</h2>Spectrum-based multiple fault localization<h2>journal</h2><h2>year</h2>2009<h2>authors</h2>Rui Abreu; Peter Zoeteweij; Arjan Jc Van Gemund<h2>ref_id</h2>b4<h2>title</h2>Who should fix this bug?<h2>journal</h2><h2>year</h2>2006<h2>authors</h2>John Anvik; Lyndon Hiew; Gail C Murphy<h2>ref_id</h2>b5<h2>title</h2>Test-driven development: by example<h2>journal</h2>Addison-Wesley Professional<h2>year</h2>2003<h2>authors</h2>Kent Beck<h2>ref_id</h2>b6<h2>title</h2>When, how, and why developers (do not) test in their IDEs<h2>journal</h2><h2>year</h2>2015<h2>authors</h2>Moritz Beller; Georgios Gousios; Annibale Panichella; Andy Zaidman<h2>ref_id</h2>b7<h2>title</h2>Neuro-symbolic program corrector for introductory programming assignments<h2>journal</h2><h2>year</h2>2018<h2>authors</h2>Sahil Bhatia; Pushmeet Kohli; Rishabh Singh<h2>ref_id</h2>b8<h2>title</h2>Harvesting Fix Hints in the History of Bugs<h2>journal</h2><h2>year</h2>2015<h2>authors</h2>F Tegawendé;  Bissyandé<h2>ref_id</h2>b9<h2>title</h2>Where is the bug and how is it fixed? an experiment with practitioners<h2>journal</h2><h2>year</h2>2017<h2>authors</h2>Marcel Böhme; Sudipta Ezekiel O Soremekun; Emamurho Chattopadhyay; Andreas Ugherughe;  Zeller<h2>ref_id</h2>b10<h2>title</h2>Gzoltar: an eclipse plug-in for testing and debugging<h2>journal</h2><h2>year</h2>2012<h2>authors</h2>José Campos; André Riboira; Alexandre Perez; Rui Abreu<h2>ref_id</h2>b11<h2>title</h2>Contract-based program repair without the contracts<h2>journal</h2><h2>year</h2>2017<h2>authors</h2>Liushan Chen; Yu Pei; Carlo A Furia<h2>ref_id</h2>b12<h2>title</h2>Program transformations to fix C integers<h2>journal</h2><h2>year</h2>2013<h2>authors</h2>Zack Coker; Munawar Hafiz<h2>ref_id</h2>b13<h2>title</h2>\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}}
