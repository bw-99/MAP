The number of arrays is rounded up to the nearest power-oftwo value, i.e., 128. We choose C=32, which corresponds to 4 mats (M =4) working in parallel inside each bank, to have a balance between storing small and large ETs. The outputs from the 4 mats are accumulated at the bank level. Finally, the Criteo Kaggle dataset has 26 sparse features for ranking. Hence, we dimension iMARS with 32 banks (B=32) to accomodate all these features. The other features are also mapped accordingly,  with some mats and CMAs deactivated in a bank according to the size of the ET. We use 26 activated banks, 104 activated mats and 2860 activated CMAs for the Criteo Kaggle dataset.\nFor the MovieLens dataset (also used in our evaluation), due to the much smaller number of rows per ET, we are still able to use the same architecture while keeping idle arrays deactivated. The MovieLens dataset uses 5 UIET for the filtering stage and 6 UIET for the ranking stage (Table I), 5 of which are shared between the filtering and ranking stages. ETs have a maximum of 6040 entries and a minimum of 3 entries. We use 7 active banks, 8 active mat and 54 active CMA in the MovieLens dataset. </p><h2>publication_ref</h2> <p>['b1', 'b0'] </p><h2>figure_ref</h2> <p>[] </p><h2>table_ref</h2> <p>['tab_0', 'tab_0'] </p><h2>heading</h2> <p>A. Array-level Evaluation </p><h2>text</h2> <p>We have designed the complete circuit of a 256×256 FeFET-based CMA, and simulated it in HSPICE by employing a Preisach based model for FeFETs [19] along with the CMOS Predictive Technology Model (PTM) from [20] with a 45nm technology node. In our evaluation, besides the memory cells inside each CMA, we also consider all the peripherals depicted in Fig. 3(c). The adder trees and communication network are implemented in Verilog and synthesized with Cadence Encounter RTL Compiler v14.10, with the NanGate 45nm open-cell library [21]. The crossbars are evaluated by the Neurosim tool [22] using a 45nm FeFET model. Table II summarizes the array-level figures-of-merit (FoM) for the different types of accesses supported by the CMA. Table II also includes the FoM for a 256×128 crossbar. These values are used for higher-level evaluations. </p><h2>publication_ref</h2> <p>['b18', 'b19', 'b20', 'b21'] </p><h2>figure_ref</h2> <p>['fig_2'] </p><h2>table_ref</h2> <p>['tab_1'] </p><h2>heading</h2> <p>B.

We implemented a YoutubeDNN filtering model [2] on the MovieLens 1M dataset [11], where a FAISS-based distance search is used. We use the hit rate (HR), the # of hits (i.e., correct predictions) divided by the # of test users, as the accuracy metric.

Energy and Latency Evaluation </p><h2>text</h2> <p>We estimated the energy and latency of iMARS based on the mapping and the simulated array-level FoM. As the latency and energy improvement of TCAM arrays and crossbars are well studied in previous work [5] [22], in this section we mainly focus on our findings on ET lookup operations, which is also a bottleneck of the RecSys. We compare the latency and energy of TCAM-based LSH search with the LSH search on GPU as well as the original cosine search on GPU. Finally we report the end-to-end system comparison.\n1) ET lookup operation: Table III shows the latency and energy consumption of the ET lookup operation in the two RecSys instances as well as on GPU. All the data are obtained for one item input. The ET lookup operation in iMARS includes the multiple lookups of CMAs, the intra-mat addition and intra-bank addition. To estimate the latency and energy on iMARS, we consider the worst case that all lookups for one ET happen in the same array. Multiple lookups in one array requires multiple read, write and in-memory add operations, incurring higher latency and energy. We also include the latency/energy overhead of communication due to wiring and serialization with the RSC bus/IBC network. Thus, under the aforesaid worst case, the iMARS takes 0.24 µs latency and 6.88 µJ energy for a single input on the Criteo Kaggle dataset and achieves 61.83× latency and 47.9× energy improvement.
