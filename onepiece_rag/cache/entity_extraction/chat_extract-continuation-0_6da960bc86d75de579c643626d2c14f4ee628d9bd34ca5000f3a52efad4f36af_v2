For instance, GraphRec [9] incorporates user-item interactions and item contents to learn a joint user-item representation via graph convolutional neural networks (GCNs) and propagate messages between connected nodes to predict ratings. PinSage [46] uses a two-level GNN architecture to capture the structural and content-based information of items, and performs neighborhood aggregation for top-N recommendations. To further reduce the model complexity and improve the performance, LightGCN [12] is the state-of-the-art GNN-based model that minimizes the number of computational resources, only applies graph convolutional operations without non-linear activation to learn user and item embeddings. These previous studies demonstrate the effectiveness of GNNs in top-N tasks by leveraging high-order relationships successfully.<h2>publication_ref</h2>['b8', 'b45', 'b11']<h2>figure_ref</h2>[]<h2>table_ref</h2>[]<h2>heading</h2>Content-Based Recommendations<h2>text</h2>2.2.1 Item Content Utilization. Item content features usually come in unstructured forms, such as item titles, descriptions, and images. To the best of our knowledge, the majority of studies such as TPR [6] and AGTM [14] specifically focus on modeling unstructured item textual contents. TPR models token-level information between users and items by constructing an enormous knowledge graph including tokens, items, and users nodes. However, the information provided by the token-level is limited; therefore, AGTM tries to leverage transformer-based language models [7,28,37] to extract item textual contents at the sentence-level. Even though both methods utilized item titles and descriptions, there is no previous model dedicated to model item textual contents and images simultaneously. However, in the field of vision-language (V-L) tasks, they have reached notable improvement and success in retrieving the information from (image,text) pairs. Vision-Language Representation Learning In recent years, the existing work on Vision-Language (V-L) representation learning can be classified into 3 main categories. The first category [4,27] involves learning separate uni-modal encoders for images and texts and utilizing a contrastive loss to pre-train on large, noisy web data. They perform exceptionally well on image-text retrieval tasks but lack the capacity to model more intricate interactions between image and text for other V-L tasks. The second category [19,24] utilizes transformer-based multi-modal encoders to model interactions between image and text features, which are highly effective in downstream V-L tasks that require intricate reasoning. However, these methods often require high-resolution input images and pre-trained object detectors. Although some recent approaches aim to improve inference speed by eliminating object detectors, they result in lower performance. Therefore, hybrid models, such as ALBEF [18] and BLIP [17], have emerged as a third category, which unifies the first two categories to create robust uni-modal and multimodal representations with superior performance on both retrieval and reasoning tasks. Furthermore, most of these recent approaches do not require object detectors, which were previously a significant bottleneck for many conventional methods.\n2.2.2 User Review Utilization. Historical reviews have been widely used to improve the learning of user and item embeddings in the field of recommendation systems [2,5,11,20,33,34,43,49]. Generally speaking, the users can be represented as the reviews they have written, and the items can be represented as the reviews they have received. For instance, DeepCoNN [50] utilized the TextCNN [3] to encode features and generate user and item embeddings for rating prediction. In order to differentiate the importance of different reviews, the attention mechanism [37] has also been introduced to improve review-based recommendation performance.\nIn some studies such as NARRE [2], after the feature extraction by CNN, attention is employed to select\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>PRINTF<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Printf is a proposed framework that generates precise recommendations based on high-order relationships in user-item interactions through graph networks.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>AMAZON-GROCERY<|>EVENT<|>Amazon-Grocery is a dataset used to evaluate the performance of the printf framework in generating recommendations.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>AMAZON-TOOLS<|>EVENT<|>Amazon-Tools is a dataset used to evaluate the performance of the printf framework in generating recommendations.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>AMAZON-ELECTRONICS<|>EVENT<|>Amazon-Electronics is a dataset used to evaluate the performance of the printf framework in generating recommendations.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GRAPH NEURAL NETWORKS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are a type of neural network that has shown promising results in various recommendation tasks.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>TPR<|>ORGANIZATION<|>TPR is a model that focuses on modeling unstructured item textual contents by constructing a knowledge graph including tokens, items, and users nodes.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>AGTM<|>ORGANIZATION<|>AGTM is a model that leverages transformer-based language models to extract item textual contents at the sentence-level.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ALBEF<|>ORGANIZATION<|>ALBEF is a hybrid model that unifies separate uni-modal encoders for images and texts to create robust representations for vision-language tasks.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BLIP<|>ORGANIZATION<|>BLIP is a hybrid model that combines features from both uni-modal and multimodal representations for superior performance on retrieval and reasoning tasks.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PRINTF<|>AMAZON-GROCERY<|>Printf framework was evaluated using the Amazon-Grocery dataset to showcase its recommendation capabilities.<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PRINTF<|>AMAZON-TOOLS<|>Printf framework was evaluated using the Amazon-Tools dataset to showcase its recommendation capabilities.<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PRINTF<|>AMAZON-ELECTRONICS<|>Printf framework was evaluated using the Amazon-Electronics dataset to showcase its recommendation capabilities.<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>GRAPH NEURAL NETWORKS<|>PRINTF<|>Graph Neural Networks are utilized in the printf framework to enhance recommendation performance through user-item interactions.<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>TPR<|>AGTM<|>TPR and AGTM are both models that focus on improving item content utilization in recommendation systems.<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ALBEF<|>BLIP<|>ALBEF and BLIP are both hybrid models that aim to improve performance in vision-language tasks by combining different encoding strategies.<|>8)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
