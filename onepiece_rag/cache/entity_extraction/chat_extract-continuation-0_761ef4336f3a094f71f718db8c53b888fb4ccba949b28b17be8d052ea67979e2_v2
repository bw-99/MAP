We intuitively expect the weighting scheme of L p to penalize those fields and regions with large cardinality, thus facilitating the compression of the model. In this paper, we focus on the CTR prediction task, where cross-entropy loss is commonly used. We combine it with L p to define the loss function of the pretraining stage as follows:\nL(y, ŷ) = -y log ŷ -(1 -y) log(1 -ŷ) + λL p ,(7)\nwhere y ∈ {0, 1} is the real label, ŷ ∈ [0, 1] is the predicted probability of y = 1, and the hyperparameter λ is a coefficient to control the degree of regularization.<h2>publication_ref</h2>['b41']<h2>figure_ref</h2>[]<h2>table_ref</h2>[]<h2>heading</h2>Algorithm 1:<h2>text</h2>The CPT-based Pruning Algorithm\nInput: The value of α i after pretraining, the threshold cpt (0 ≤ cpt ≤ 1), and the search space\nD = {d 1 , • • • , d K }.\nOutput: a pruned dimension size d fi assigned to field f i . 1 Sort the architecture weights α i in the descending order:\nα i = [α i j1 , • • • , α i j K ], satisfying α i j1 ≥ α i j2 ≥ • • • ≥ α i j K ; 2 sum = 0 ;\n// The cumulative weight 3 d fi = 0 ; // The cumulative dimension size 4 for t ∈ [1, 2, . . . , K] do 5\nd fi = d fi + c jt ;\n// c jt is the embedding size of α i jt calculated from Eq.( 6) \n6 sum = sum + α i jt ; //<h2>publication_ref</h2>[]<h2>figure_ref</h2>[]<h2>table_ref</h2>[]<h2>heading</h2>One-level Optimization<h2>text</h2>In this work, we reparameterize the problem of feature selection and dimension search as a structural search problem and relax the selection of different operators to be continuous and differentiable. We slightly abuse the symbol\nA = [ α 1 , • • • , α N ]\nto denote all the continuous architecture parameters and W(A) to represent the downstream DNN parameters. Different from DARTS-style works [7], [17], [19] that use bi-level optimization to iteratively update A and W(A), we follow the setting of [36] and use one-level optimization to simultaneously train A and W(A) on the training set T . In addition to being time-consuming, [36] empirically demonstrated that bi-level optimization might downgrade the final performance due to the accumulation of errors from multiple approximations. On the other hand, we argue that there are many causes that can affect the performance and stability of bi-level optimization, such as the size of the validation set and the switch interval during iterative training. Hence, we adopt one-level optimization for practicality and efficiency by simultaneously updating A and W(A) via gradient descent as follows:\n∂ A L (T ; A, W (A)) and ∂ W(A) L (T ; A, W (A)).

We then seek to derive the optimal subset F ⊆ F and the corresponding dimension configuration C A . Retraining the target DNN model with F and C A aims to eliminate suboptimal influence since the unpicked fields in F and the redundant embedding dimensions are also involved during the pretraining stage.<h2>publication_ref</h2>[]<h2>figure_ref</h2>[]<h2>table_ref</h2>[]<h2>heading</h2>Input Configuration Derivation<h2>text</h2>Despite the hard selector argmax being widely used in previous DARTS-style work [17], [19], we argue that it can lead to an inconsistency between the pretraining model and the retraining model, resulting in inferior performance. For instance, assume there is a field that has three candidate dimensions with corresponding weights of {0.33, 0.33, 0.34}. It is difficult to judge which operator is better since the gap is too small, and dropping all of the relatively smaller operators can lead to a dilemma that the total weight of the dropped operators is much higher than the selected one. Moreover, due to randomness during DNN model training, the derived optimal operators can also be unstable. To alleviate such issues, we set a cumulative probability threshold (CPT) to flexibly adjust the minimum amount of information kept in the retraining stage, supplemented with a pruning algorithm to derive the embedding dimension d fi for each field f i .
