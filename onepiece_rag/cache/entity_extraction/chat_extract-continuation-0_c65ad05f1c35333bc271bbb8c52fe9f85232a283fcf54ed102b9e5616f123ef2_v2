Therefore, it is always safe to use π 1 , even though it can be sometimes more pessimistic, e.g., when t 3 is 23. </p><h2>publication_ref</h2> <p>[] </p><h2>figure_ref</h2> <p>[] </p><h2>table_ref</h2> <p>[] </p><h2>heading</h2> <p>Different Utilization Bounds </p><h2>text</h2> <p>The analysis in Lemma 1 uses the execution time and the utilization of the tasks in hp(τ k ) to build an upper bound of C k /t k for schedulability tests. It is also very convenient in real-time systems to build schedulability tests only based on utilization of the tasks. We explain how to achieve that in the following lemmas under the assumptions that 0 < α i ≤ α, and 0 < β i C i ≤ βU i t k for any i = 1, 2, . . . , k -1. These lemmas are useful when we are interested to derive utilization bounds, speed-up factors, resource augmentation factors, etc., for a given scheduling policy by defining the coefficients α and β according to the scheduling policies independently from the detailed parameters of the tasks. Since the property repeats in all the statements, we make a formal definition before presenting the lemmas. Definition 4. Lemmas 3 to 5 are based on the following kpoint last-release schedulability test of a scheduling algorithm, defined in Definition 2, in which 0 < α i ≤ α, and 0\n< β i C i ≤ βU i t k for any i = 1, 2, . . . , k -1, 0 < t k , α k-1 i=1 U i ≤ 1, and β k-1 i=1 U i ≤ 1. Lemma 3.\nFor a given k-point last-release schedulability test of a scheduling algorithm, with the properties in Definition 4, task τ k is schedulable by the scheduling algorithm if the following condition holds\nC k t k ≤1 -(α + β) k-1 i=1 Ui + αβ k-1 i=1 Ui( k-1 =i U )(16)\n=1 -(α + β) k-1 i=1 Ui + 0.5αβ ( k-1 i=1 Ui) 2 + ( k-1 i=1 U 2 i )(17)\nProof: The condition in Eq. ( 16) comes by reformulating the proof of Lemma 1 with βU i t * k instead of β i C i . All the procedures remain the same, and, therefore, β i C i for task τ i in the right-hand side of Eq. ( 5) can be replaced by βU i .\nWe focus on the condition in Eq. ( 17) by showing that\nk-1 i=1 U i ( k-1 =i U ) = 0.5 ( k-1 i=1 U i ) 2 + ( k-1 i=1 U 2 i ) . This condition clearly holds when k = 2 since U 2 1 = 0.5(U 2 1 + U 2 1\n). We consider k ≥ 3. This is due to\nk-1 i=1 U i ( k-1 =i U ) = k-1 i=1 U 2 i + k-2 i=1 U i ( k-1 =i+1 U ) = 1 k-1 i=1 U 2 i + 0.5   k-1 i=1 U i 2 - k-1 i=1 U 2 i   = 0.5 ( k-1 i=1 U i ) 2 + ( k-1 i=1 U 2 i ) ,\nwhere = 1 follows from the fact\nk-2 i=1 U i ( k-1 =i+1 U ) = k-1 i=2 U i ( i-1 =1 U ) = 0.5 k-1 i=1 U i 2 - k-1 i=1 U 2 i .\nLemma 3 provides a schedulability test based on a quadratic form by using only the utilization of the higherpriority tasks with the properties in Definition 4. The following two lemmas are applicable for testing the utilization bound(s), i.e., the summation of the task utilization.\nLemma 4. For a given k-point last-release schedulability test of a scheduling algorithm, with the properties in Definition 4, task τ k is schedulable by the scheduling algorithm if\nk-1 i=1 Ui ≤ k -1 k   α + β -(α + β) 2 -2αβ(1 -C k t k ) k k-1 αβ   .(18)\nProof: This can be formally proved by using the Lagrange Multiplier Method. However, it can also be proved by using a simpler mathematical observation. Suppose that x = k-1 i=1 U i is given. For given α, β, and x, we know that Eq. ( 17) becomes 1 -\n(α + β)x + 0.5αβ(x 2 + k-1 i=1 U 2 i ). That is, only the last term 0.5αβ( k-1 i=1 U 2 i\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>LEMMA 2<|>CONCEPT<|>Lemma 2 is a mathematical statement that provides a basis for the analysis of scheduling algorithms, particularly in relation to the utilization of tasks in real-time systems.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>UTILIZATION BOUNDS<|>CONCEPT<|>Utilization bounds are metrics used in scheduling theory to determine the efficiency and feasibility of task scheduling in real-time systems.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SCHEDULABILITY TEST<|>CONCEPT<|>A schedulability test is a method used to determine whether a set of tasks can be scheduled to meet their deadlines under a given scheduling algorithm.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SCHEDULING ALGORITHM<|>CONCEPT<|>A scheduling algorithm is a method for determining the order in which tasks are executed in a computing environment, particularly in real-time systems.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LEMMA 1<|>CONCEPT<|>Lemma 1 is a mathematical statement that serves as a foundation for deriving conditions related to task schedulability in scheduling algorithms.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DEFINITION 4<|>CONCEPT<|>Definition 4 outlines the properties and conditions necessary for a k-point last-release schedulability test in scheduling algorithms.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>LEMMA 2<|>SCHEDULABILITY TEST<|>Lemma 2 provides foundational principles that are used to establish conditions for a schedulability test in scheduling algorithms.<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>UTILIZATION BOUNDS<|>SCHEDULABILITY TEST<|>Utilization bounds are critical for performing schedulability tests, as they help determine if tasks can be scheduled without missing deadlines.<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SCHEDULING ALGORITHM<|>SCHEDULABILITY TEST<|>A schedulability test is applied to a scheduling algorithm to assess whether it can successfully schedule a set of tasks.<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>LEMMA 1<|>LEMMA 2<|>Lemma 1 and Lemma 2 are interconnected as they both contribute to the understanding of task schedulability in scheduling algorithms.<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>DEFINITION 4<|>SCHEDULABILITY TEST<|>Definition 4 provides the necessary properties that must be satisfied for a schedulability test to be valid in the context of scheduling algorithms.<|>8)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
