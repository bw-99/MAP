The analysis in [31] is limited degree-based aggregation and Euclidean space. The hyperbolic message passing learning paradigm of 𝜅HGCN also shows a similar phenomenon, which causes too much influence loss in long-term propagation. Especially, if the paths consist of numerous connections to other nodes, the node influence is minimal. For clarity, we term the hyperbolic message passing learning paradigm in 𝜅HGCN or original HGNNs [11,45,96] as HMP. The HMP is a local aggregation method, in which the influence of nodes decreases with increasing distance, as demonstrated in Theorem 4.3. </p><h2>publication_ref</h2> <p>['b34', 'b30', 'b30', 'b10', 'b44', 'b95'] </p><h2>figure_ref</h2> <p>[] </p><h2>table_ref</h2> <p>[] </p><h2>heading</h2> <p>Theorem 4.3 (Decaying property of HMP). </p><h2>text</h2> <p>Let 𝑝 be a path between node 𝑢 and node 𝑣, 𝑑 * 𝑔 be the shortest distance between 𝑢 and 𝑣, let 𝐶 be a constant and z be the embedding on the tangent space.

Recall the aggregation rule in Equations ( 6) and ( 7) (similar to that in origin HGNNs), we focus on the aggregation in the tangent space and ignore the previous logarithmic map and the later exponential map since they are applied before and after the whole aggregation process, respectively.
