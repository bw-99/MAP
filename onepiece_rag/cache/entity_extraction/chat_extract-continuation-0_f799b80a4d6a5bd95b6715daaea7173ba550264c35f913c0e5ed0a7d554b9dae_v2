Filter methods measure the discriminant attributes of features through criteria such as information gain [11] and feature consistency [12], so as to extract high-ranked features. Wrapper methods optimize feature subsets by using performance assessments such as the K-nearest neighbor (KNN) algorithm and linear discriminant analysis (LDA) instead of solely relying on evaluation criteria [13]. Compared with Filter and Wrapper, Embedded methods, such as the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) [14] and the gradient-boosting decision tree (GBDT) [15], [16], incorporate feature selection as part of the training process. Despite compensating for the drawbacks of low efficiency in Filter and high computational cost in Wrapper, the effectiveness of Embedded methods is substantially dependent on conductive parameters and strict model assumptions [9]. Although the aforementioned feature selection methods have proven effective in several scenarios, there could be a mismatch between the subset of features selected to optimize the feature selection model and the subset that would ideally serve the target DNN model. Recognizing that DNN models can capture more complex feature interactions, it would be logical to use the target DNN model to guide feature selection directly. In light of this, we propose a model-consistent feature selection approach that integrates the target DNN model into the feature selection process. Our approach belongs to the Embedded methods in a broad sense, but there is a notable difference between our study and previous work: we evaluate the importance of features from the point of view of each feature's optimal embedding dimension size under the target DNN model.\nIn recent years, there has been an increasing interest in studying embedding dimensions, as the embedding layer impacts on both the scale and the inductive bias of DNNbased recommendation models [7]. Specifying an adaptive embedding dimension for each feature is a problem of exponential complexity. A common practice is to set a unified value for all features by hyperparameter tuning experiments or relying on expert knowledge. However, such practice does not distinguish between different features and can be memory inefficient. Inspired by recent progress in neural architecture search (NAS) [17], methods based on reinforcement learning [18], differentiable search [19], [20], pruning [21], and so forth, have been proposed to perform dimension search at either field level or feature level 1 . Despite the ability of these methods to reduce model parameters without compromising model performance given a carefully selected feature subset, their effectiveness without feature selection remains unexplored. The dependency on feature selection effectively equates to assuming all input features are beneficial during the dimension search process. We believe that there is a necessity to conduct dimension search under the assumption that not all features in the original feature set are helpful, as the updating of features can be very frequent in industrial practice. With this objective, we propose a differentiable framework that identifies redundantly assigned embedding dimensions for pruning. Specifically, a feature with its embedding dimension pruned to 0 is considered unimportant. It is worth noting that features are typically grouped into fields for practical reasons in industrial recommender systems, and these fields can 1. Field-level methods assign the same dimension to all features within the same field while feature-level ones can assign diverse dimensions to different features within the same field.\nhave significantly varying cardinalities. For example, the field Gender generally contains two features \"Female\" and \"Male\", while the field Browsed Goods may have millions of features. While individual dimension assignment for each feature (i.e., feature-level methods) might boost performance, field selection and field-level dimension search are often prioritized in large-scale recommender systems to reduce complexity and enhance implementation ease. This paper emphasizes assigning different dimension sizes to fields based on their importance, and discarding less important fields during the retraining stage. Unless otherwise specified, the term \"feature selection\" hereafter refers to the selection of fields.\nTo guide the input configuration towards better optima, we propose a differentiable neural input razor (i-Razor) that is capable of simultaneously pruning unnecessary fields and assigning adaptive embedding dimensions. The training of i-Razor consists of two stages. i) In the pretraining stage, we refine the dimension search space to learn the importance of different fields and different embedding regions. Meanwhile, to control the number of model parameters and avoid overfitting, we introduce a novel regularization term to regularize the model complexity. ii) In the retraining stage, a proposed pruning algorithm is executed to remove redundant fields and preserve the desired embedding dimensions for the remaining fields according to the relative weights of each embedding region. We then reconstruct the DNN model and retrain it with the training dataset based on the derived input configuration. We conduct extensive experiments on two large-scale public datasets for the CTR prediction task. The experimental results show that i-Razor achieves higher prediction accuracy while saving fields than several state-ofthe-art methods.\nThe main contributions of this paper are threefold. • Traditionally, feature selection and embedding dimension search were treated as separate processes. Our research presents a pioneering approach that explores their joint optimization. This innovative leap not only bridges the gap between feature selection and dimension search but also hints at a higher level of alignment between the two, which has the potential to discover input configurations that more closely approach optimal solutions. The remainder of this paper is organized as follows: Section 2 discusses the related literature on feature selection and embedding dimension search. We formulate the input configuration optimization problem and present the framework of i-Razor in Section 3. In Section 4, we elaborate on our experimental setup and empirical results. Finally, we conclude our work and discuss its potential future extensions in Section 5.<h2>publication_ref</h2>['b0', 'b1', 'b2', 'b3', 'b4', 'b3', 'b5', 'b6', '\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>I-RAZOR<|>ORGANIZATION<|>i-Razor is a proposed differentiable neural input razor that prunes unnecessary fields and assigns adaptive embedding dimensions in DNN models.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DNN<|>ORGANIZATION<|>DNN refers to Deep Neural Networks, which are used in recommendation models and can capture complex feature interactions.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>K-NEAREST NEIGHBOR<|>ORGANIZATION<|>K-nearest neighbor (KNN) is an algorithm used for performance assessments in feature selection.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LINEAR DISCRIMINANT ANALYSIS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) is another algorithm used for performance assessments in feature selection.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LASSO<|>ORGANIZATION<|>LASSO stands for Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator, which is an embedded method for feature selection.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GBDT<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Gradient-Boosting Decision Tree (GBDT) is an embedded method for feature selection.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>FILTER METHODS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Filter methods are a category of feature selection methods that measure discriminant attributes through criteria such as information gain.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>WRAPPER METHODS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Wrapper methods are a category of feature selection methods that optimize feature subsets using performance assessments.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>NEURAL ARCHITECTURE SEARCH<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Neural Architecture Search (NAS) is a method that has inspired recent progress in dimension search.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>REINFORCEMENT LEARNING<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Reinforcement learning is a method proposed for dimension search at either field level or feature level.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PRUNING<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Pruning is a method proposed for dimension search that reduces model parameters without compromising performance.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>FEATURE SELECTION<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Feature selection is the process of selecting a subset of relevant features for model training.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CTR PREDICTION<|>EVENT<|>CTR prediction refers to Click-Through Rate prediction, a task for which extensive experiments were conducted.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>I-RAZOR<|>DNN<|>i-Razor is designed to optimize input configurations for DNN models by pruning fields and assigning dimensions<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>FILTER METHODS<|>FEATURE SELECTION<|>Filter methods are a type of feature selection method that evaluates features based on certain criteria<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>WRAPPER METHODS<|>FEATURE SELECTION<|>Wrapper methods are another type of feature selection method that uses performance assessments<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>LASSO<|>FEATURE SELECTION<|>LASSO is an embedded method used for feature selection<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>GBDT<|>FEATURE SELECTION<|>GBDT is also an embedded method used for feature selection<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>K-NEAREST NEIGHBOR<|>WRAPPER METHODS<|>K-nearest neighbor is an algorithm used in wrapper methods for performance assessments<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>LINEAR DISCRIMINANT ANALYSIS<|>WRAPPER METHODS<|>Linear Discriminant Analysis is another algorithm used in wrapper methods for performance assessments<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>NEURAL ARCHITECTURE SEARCH<|>DIMENSION SEARCH<|>Neural Architecture Search has inspired methods for dimension search in feature selection<|>4)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>REINFORCEMENT LEARNING<|>DIMENSION SEARCH<|>Reinforcement learning is a method proposed for conducting dimension search<|>4)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PRUNING<|>DIMENSION SEARCH<|>Pruning is a method that helps reduce model parameters during dimension search<|>4)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>I-RAZOR<|>CTR PREDICTION<|>i-Razor was tested on large-scale public datasets for the CTR prediction task<|>7)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
