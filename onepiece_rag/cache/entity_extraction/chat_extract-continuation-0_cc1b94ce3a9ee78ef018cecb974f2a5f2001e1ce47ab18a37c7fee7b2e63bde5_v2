The key idea is to introduce a soft selection layer that estimates the importance of different embedding regions and thus evaluates the field importance. Moreover, we design a CPTbased pruning algorithm to flexibly generate the mixed embedding configuration. While conceptually simple, i-Razor provides us with a concrete framework that is amenable to practicality and can be easily incorporated with various recommendation models. CTR prediction experiments on two real-world datasets verify the efficacy of i-Razor on the joint optimization of feature selection and dimension search. Since i-Razor can serve as an efficient plug-in for recommendation models, future work may include extension to other recommendation tasks. </p><h2>figure_data</h2> <p>Metric </p><h1>formulas</h1><h2>formula_id</h2> <p>formula_0 </p><h2>formula_text</h2> <p>D = {d 1 , ‚Ä¢ ‚Ä¢ ‚Ä¢ , d K }, where K represents the number of candidate dimensions and d 1 < ‚Ä¢ ‚Ä¢ ‚Ä¢ < d K . </p><h2>formula_coordinates</h2> <p>[4.0, 312.0, 391.12, 252.0, 21.19] </p><h2>formula_id</h2> <p>formula_1 </p><h2>formula_text</h2> <p>min A L (C A , W (A)) ,(1) </p><h2>formula_coordinates</h2> <p>[4.0, 395.44, 519.62, 169.51, 14.51] </p><h2>formula_id</h2> <p>formula_2 </p><h2>formula_text</h2> <p>d j | d j = j√ó(j-1) 2 , j ‚àà [1, K] or d j | d j = 2 j-1 , j ‚àà [1, K] </p><h2>formula_coordinates</h2> <p>[5.0, 317.54, 183.06, 246.65, 26.7] </p><h2>formula_id</h2> <p>formula_3 </p><h2>formula_text</h2> <p>ùëí ! \" ùëí # \" e $ \" ùëí % \" ùëí & \" ùëí ' \" ùëí ( \" ùëí ) \" ùëí !
