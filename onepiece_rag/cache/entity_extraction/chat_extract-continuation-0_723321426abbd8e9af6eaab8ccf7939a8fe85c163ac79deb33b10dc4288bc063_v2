It is important to note that we do not use the same heuristic for recommender evaluation. Rather, as we describe in a later section, we use Mechanical Turk workers to evaluate resulting recommendation accuracy, allowing us to understand the efficacy of our distant supervision framework. • Negative samples: We also introduce negative examples, referring to repositories that are not highly related to a query paper. In this work, we randomly sample n k negative examples of repositories across the entire graph to train the model. We expect the similarity scores of positive examples to be larger than those of negative examples.\nÃ = A p + I N , D = j Ãi j , H (0) = X p ; 3 p i ← ReLU D-1 2 Ã D-1 2 H (l ) W (l ) ; 4 p i ← p i / ∥p i ∥ 2 ; 5 /* For repo embeddings */ 6 Ã = A r + I N , D = j Ãi j , H (0) = X r ; 7 r j ← ReLU D-1 2 Ã D-1 2 H (l ) W (l ) ; 8 r j ← r j /\nWe briefly summarize the proposed constrained GCN algorithm in Algorithm 1. In this algorithm, the first l layers learn the hidden vectors (embeddings) of each paper and repository using the GCN algorithm in (1). Then we use the normalized embeddings of paper p i , and repository r j to compute their similarity scores. Additionally, we try to minimize the distance between the embeddings of bridge papers and their original repositories as an added constraint.<h2>publication_ref</h2>['b0']<h2>figure_ref</h2>[]<h2>table_ref</h2>['tab_0']<h2>heading</h2>EXPERIMENTS<h2>text</h2>We carry out experiments to evaluate the performance of the proposed paper2repo on the real-world data sets collected from GitHub and Microsoft Academic. Further, we show that the proposed model performs well on larger data sets without any hyper-parameter tuning. In addition, we conduct ablation experiments to explore how design choices impact performance. Finally, we conduct a case study to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed method.<h2>publication_ref</h2>[]<h2>figure_ref</h2>[]<h2>table_ref</h2>[]<h2>heading</h2>Datasets<h2>text</h2>We collected a repository data set and a research paper data set from GitHub and Microsoft Academic, respectively. Microsoft Academic provides an API for users to query the detailed entities of academic papers, such as paper title, abstract, and venue names. For a proof of concept, we query the top 20 venue names and 8 journals of computer science, such as KDD, WWW, ACL, ICML, NIPS, CVPR and TKDE, to retrieve the entities of 59, 404 raw papers from year 2010 to 2018. After that, we query for the titles of these papers to collect some original open source repositories through the GitHub API. We obtain about 2, 427 original repositories corresponding to the named papers. We define bridge papers as those for which we found a matching repository (which we call the bridge repository). In addition, we collect about 8, 000 popular repositories from users who star the bridge repositories. After data cleaning and preprocessing, we have 32, 029 research papers and 7, 571 repositories, including 2, 107 bridge repositories. In our experiments, we evaluate the performance of the proposed model on both small and full data sets as illustrated in Table 2. Testing and ground truth estimation. To evaluate the accuracy of our recommender system, its results need to be compared to ground truth (that is not part of training data). For that purpose, we asked human graders on Amazon Mechanical Turk (AMT) to evaluate produced recommendations. Specifically, for each pair to be evaluated, we provided the graders with (i) the paper title, abstract, and (ii) the description, ReadMe (if available) and URL the corresponding repository on GitHub. The graders were asked to grade similarity on a three point scale: Score âĂĲ2âĂİ meant that the paper and repository were highly related; score âĂĲ1âĂİ meant that they were somewhat related; and score âĂĲ0âĂİ meant that the pair was not related. Three graders were used per pair.\nAfter labelling, we considered those pairs that received a score of 1 or 2 from all graders to be correct matches. Pairs that received a score of 1 or 0 from all graders (and received at least one zero) were considered to be incorrect matches. Finally, pairs where graders disagreed, receiving scores 0 and 2 together (about 7% result), were graded by an additional grader. An average was then computed. If the average score was less than 1, the pair was considered unrelated (an incorrect match). Otherwise, it was considered a correct match.\nIt remains to describe how we partition data into the training set and test set. We already described how positive and negative training pairs were selected. It is tempting to try and choose test papers and repositories at random. However, due to the large number of papers and repositories available on the respective platforms, this random sampling leads to a predominance of unrelated pairs, unless the test set is very large (which would be very expensive to label). Clearly, restricting testing to predominantly unrelated papers\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>GITHUB<|>ORGANIZATION<|>GitHub is a platform for hosting and sharing code repositories, widely used by developers and researchers to collaborate on projects.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MICROSOFT ACADEMIC<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Microsoft Academic is a research tool that provides access to academic papers and their metadata, including titles, abstracts, and venue names.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PAPER2REPO<|>EVENT<|>Paper2Repo is a proposed model for linking academic papers to their corresponding code repositories, evaluated through experiments on real-world datasets.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>REPOSITORY DATA SET<|>EVENT<|>A collection of code repositories gathered from GitHub for the purpose of evaluating the Paper2Repo model.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>RESEARCH PAPER DATA SET<|>EVENT<|>A collection of academic papers collected from Microsoft Academic to evaluate the Paper2Repo model.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>AMAZON MECHANICAL TURK<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Amazon Mechanical Turk is a crowdsourcing marketplace that enables individuals to coordinate the use of human intelligence to perform tasks that computers are currently unable to do.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>GITHUB<|>PAPER2REPO<|>The Paper2Repo model utilizes repositories from GitHub to establish connections between academic papers and their corresponding code bases.<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MICROSOFT ACADEMIC<|>PAPER2REPO<|>The Paper2Repo model uses data from Microsoft Academic to link research papers with their respective repositories.<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PAPER2REPO<|>REPOSITORY DATA SET<|>The repository data set is used in the Paper2Repo model to evaluate its performance in linking papers to repositories.<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PAPER2REPO<|>RESEARCH PAPER DATA SET<|>The research paper data set is used in the Paper2Repo model to evaluate its performance in linking papers to repositories.<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>AMAZON MECHANICAL TURK<|>PAPER2REPO<|>Amazon Mechanical Turk is used to evaluate the accuracy of the Paper2Repo model by having human graders assess the similarity of paper-repository pairs.<|>6)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
