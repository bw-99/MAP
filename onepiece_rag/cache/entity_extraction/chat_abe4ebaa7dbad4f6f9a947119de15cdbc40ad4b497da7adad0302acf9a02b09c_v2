Hyperbolic geometry has been recognized as a continuous tree [37], exhibiting properties such as low distortion and small generalization errors when modeling treelike structured data [63,72,73]. Its applications span various domains [50,61,90], including computer vision [5,30,34], natural language processing [8,10,36,51,56,57,62], recommender systems [14,70,80,81,87,91], graph learning [7,11,27,43,45,89,96] and more [84]. In the graph learning domain, recent works [11,43,45,47,89,92,96,97] have generalized graph neural networks to hyperbolic space and demonstrated impressive performance, particularly on tree-like data. Some studies [60,71,82,103] propose learning graph in different embedding spaces or product spaces. Furthermore, researchers have also explored the use of ultrahyperbolic geometry for graph learning [38,39,85,86]. However, many existing methods fail to consider the local heterogeneous structure of graphs, resulting in significant distortion and low-quality embeddings. </p><h2>publication_ref</h2> <p>['b16', 'b101', 'b36', 'b62', 'b71', 'b72', 'b49', 'b60', 'b89', 'b4', 'b29', 'b33', 'b7', 'b9', 'b35', 'b50', 'b55', 'b56', 'b61', 'b13', 'b69', 'b79', 'b80', 'b86', 'b90', 'b6', 'b10', 'b26', 'b42', 'b44', 'b88', 'b95', 'b83', 'b10', 'b42', 'b44', 'b46', 'b88', 'b91', 'b95', 'b96', 'b59', 'b70', 'b81', 'b102', 'b37', 'b38', 'b84', 'b85'] </p><h2>figure_ref</h2> <p>[] </p><h2>table_ref</h2> <p>[] </p><h2>heading</h2> <p>Graph Curvature </p><h2>text</h2> <p>Graph curvature, resembling curvature in continuous geometry, includes Gaussian curvature, Ricci curvature, and average curvature. Each of these elements serves a distinct purpose: Gaussian curvature measures local curvature at vertices, Ricci curvature assigns curvature to edges, and average curvature offers a global measure for the entire graph. Applications of graph curvatures span various domains in network alignment, congestion and vulnerability detection, community detection, and robustness analysis [32,54,55].\nThe recent work of curvature graph neural network (CurvGN) [93] introduced the notion of Ricci curvature into the field of graph learning. The study in [74] showed that edges with negative curvature can contribute to the over-squashing problem in graph embeddings. Coinciding with the announcement of the accepted papers for WWW 2023, we noted a parallel work by Fu et al. [22] that introduces the idea of class-aware Ricci curvature for addressing hierarchy-imbalance in node classification, while in our work, we aim to explore the integration of more generalized ricci curvature with hyperbolic graph convolution and curvature-based filtering mechanism to enhance the performance of HGCN for a more range of tasks, including node classification and link prediction. </p><h2>publication_ref</h2> <p>['b31', 'b53', 'b54', 'b92', 'b73', 'b21'] </p><h2>figure_ref</h2> <p>[] </p><h2>table_ref</h2> <p>[] </p><h2>heading</h2> <p>BACKGROUND </p><h2>text</h2> <p>In this part, we first briefly review the necessary definitions of differential geometry, primarily concentrating on hyperbolic geometry.
