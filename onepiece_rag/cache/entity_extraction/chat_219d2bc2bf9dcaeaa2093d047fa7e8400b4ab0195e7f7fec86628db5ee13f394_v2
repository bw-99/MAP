Meanwhile, we can directly pick out useful cross fields according to their derived embedding dimension size. For instance, \"site id * C14\", \"site domain * mday\", \"app category * device model\", and \"device model * C20\" are expected to be beneficial cross fields, since they are assigned with the largest dimension size. Furthermore, we can find the configuration matrix is sparse, where only 75 out of the 300 fields are greater than 0. This means that we can directly increase the high-order interaction between different fields to enrich the feature space, and rely on i-Razor to remove the superfluous fields. The visualization result also supports the conclusion that i-Razor allows a fine-grained pruning procedure so that discriminative fields can be assigned the appropriate dimension according to their predictive capacity. Such findings demonstrate i-Razor's capability to automatically assess the quality of fields, which facilitates the screening of new features and can guide feature engineering iterations in industrial recommender systems.<h2>publication_ref</h2>[]<h2>figure_ref</h2>['fig_3']<h2>table_ref</h2>[]<h2>heading</h2>Compatibility and Transferability Study (RQ6)<h2>text</h2>In this subsection, we investigate the compatibility and transferability of i-Razor. We examine its applicability beyond multi-layer perceptron (MLP) models [54] and assess the effectiveness of the derived input configurations in different recommendation architectures. Our experiments focus on advanced deep recommendation models such as DeepFM [47], xDeepFM [55], and IPNN [45], [56] using the Avazu dataset.\nTo ensure dimension uniformity for feature interaction operations, we introduce different MLP layers for each field to perform linear transformations on embeddings. We compare three configurations in Table 7: FDE, which evenly allocates 30 dimensions to all fields; MLP, which transfers the input configuration learned from the MLP model; and model-consistent configurations specifically derived from each target model.\nOur experiments yield the following key findings:\n• Directly adopting the input configuration learned from the MLP model to other deep recommendation models results in the removal of irrelevant fields, parameter compression, and improved AUC performance. These findings demonstrate the instructiveness of the MLP input configuration for enhancing the performance of other deep recommender systems on the same dataset. • Model-consistent configurations derived specifically for each target model outperform the other two competitors. This highlights the compatibility of i-Razor with various deep recommendation models and emphasizes the importance of using model-specific configurations to achieve optimal performance. Overall, our experiments confirm the compatibility and transferability of i-Razor, showcasing its ability to generate input configurations that improve model performance and parameter efficiency across various deep models.<h2>publication_ref</h2>['b53', 'b46', 'b54', 'b44', 'b55']<h2>figure_ref</h2>[]<h2>table_ref</h2>['tab_11']<h2>heading</h2>CONCLUSION<h2>text</h2>In this paper, we address the challenge of feature selection and dimension search in modern DNN-based recommender systems.
