For example, the total utilization bounds derived in [16], [30], [39] are mainly for rate-monotonic (RM) scheduling, in which the results in [30] can be extended for arbitrary fixed-priority scheduling. Kuo et al. [32] further improve the total utilization bound by using the notion of divisibility. Lee et al. [33] use linear programming formulations for calculating total utilization bounds when the period of a task can be selected. Moreover, Wu et al. [47] adopt the Network Calculus to analyze the total utilization bounds of several real-time task models.\nBini and Buttazzo [12] propose a framework of schedulability tests that can be tuned to balance the time complexity and the acceptance ratio of the schedulability test for uniprocessor sporadic task systems. The efficient tests in [12] are based on an observation to test whether the parameters of a task set fall into a schedulable region of the fixed-priority scheduling policy. Our strategy and philosophy are simpler than [12]. First, we only look at the parameters of task τ k (the task defined as the k th highest priority) that is under analysis by assuming that the higher-priority tasks are already verified to be schedulable. Second, similar to our recent general schedulability analysis framework k 2 U [20], we also apply the key idea of evaluating only k points. The tunable strategies in [12] consider to examine a subset of the time points for schedulability tests.\nDistinct from the results in [12], our objective in this paper is to find closed-form schedulability tests and responsetime analyses that can be independent from task and platform models. We target at sufficient schedulability tests and response time analyses that are not exact but can be calculated efficiently in linear-time or polynomial-time complexity.\nComparison to k 2 U: Even though k 2 Q and k 2 U share the same idea to test and evaluate only k points, they are based on completely different criteria for testing. In k 2 U, all the testings and formulations are based on only the higher-priority task utilizations. In k 2 Q, the testings are based not only on the higher-priority task utilizations, but also on the higher-priority task execution times. The above difference in the formulations results in completely different properties and mathematical closed-forms. The natural condition of k 2 Q is a quadratic form for testing the schedulability or the response time of a task, whereas the natural condition of k 2 U is a hyperbolic form for testing the schedulability of a task.\nIf one framework were dominated by another or these two frameworks were just with minor difference in mathematical formulations, it wouldn't be necessary to separate and present them as two different frameworks. Both frameworks are in fact needed and have to be applied for different cases. Here, we only shortly explain their differences, advantages, and disadvantages in this paper. For completeness, another document has been prepared in [18] to present the similarity, the difference and the characteristics of these two frameworks in details.\nSince the formulation of k 2 U is more restrictive than k 2 Q, its applicability is limited by the possibility to formulate the tests purely by using higher-priority task utilizations without referring to their execution times. There are cases, in which formulating the higher-priority interference by using only task utilizations for k 2 U is troublesome or over-pessimistic. For such cases, further introducing the upper bound of the execution time by using k 2 Q is more precise. Most of the presented cases, except the one in uniprocessor constraineddeadline systems in Appendix B are in the above category. Although k 2 Q is more general, it is not as precise as k 2 U, if we can formulate the schedulability tests into both frameworks with the same parameters. In such cases, the same pseudopolynomial-time (or exponential time) test is used, and the utilization bound or speed-up factor analysis derived from the k 2 U framework is, in general, tighter and better.\nIn a nutshell, k 2 Q is more general, whereas k 2 U is more precise. If an exact schedulability test can be constructed and the test can be converted into k 2 U, e.g., uniprocessor scheduling for constrained-deadline task sets, then, adopting k 2 U leads to tight results. For example, by using k 2 Q, we can reach the conclusion that the utilization bound for ratemonotonic scheduling is 2-√ 2 ≈ 0.586, which is less precise than the Liu and Layland bound ln 2 ≈ 0.693, a simple implication by using k 2 U. However, if we are allowed to change the execution time and period of a task for different job releases (called acyclic task model in [1]), then the tight utilization bound 2-√ 2 can be easily achieved by using k 2 Q.\nDue to the fact the k 2 U is more precise (with respect to the utilization bound) when the exact tests can be constructed, even though k 2 U is more restrictive, both are needed for different cases. Both k 2 U and k 2 Q are general enough to cover a range of spectrum of applications, ranging from uniprocessor systems to multiprocessor systems.
