An ultimate automation target of software maintenance is then the systematization of patch generation for user-reported bugs. Although this ambition is aligned with the momentum of automated program repair, the literature has, so far, mostly focused on generate-andvalidate setups where fault localization and patch generation are driven by a well-defined test suite. On the one hand, however, the common (yet strong) assumption on the existence of relevant test cases does not hold in practice for most development settings: many bugs are reported without the available test suite being able to reveal them. On the other hand, for many projects, the number of bug reports generally outstrips the resources available to triage them. Towards increasing the adoption of patch generation tools by practitioners, we investigate a new repair pipeline, iFixR, driven by bug reports: (1) bug reports are fed to an IR-based fault localizer; (2) patches are generated from fix patterns and validated via regression testing; (3) a prioritized list of generated patches is proposed to developers. We evaluate iFixR on the Defects4J dataset, which we enriched (i.e., faults are linked to bug reports) and carefullyreorganized (i.e., the timeline of test-cases is naturally split). iFixR generates genuine/plausible patches for 21/44 Defects4J faults with its IR-based fault localizer. iFixR accurately places a genuine/plausible patch among its top-5 recommendation for 8/13 of these faults (without using future test cases in generation-and-validation).<h1>sections</h1><h2>heading</h2>INTRODUCTION<h2>text</h2>Automated program repair (APR) has gained incredible momentum in the last decade. Since the seminal work by Weimer et al. [83] who relied on genetic programming to evolve program variants until one variant is found to satisfy the functional constraints of a test suite, the community has been interested in test-based techniques to repair programs without specifications. Thus, various approaches [12,13,18,19,25,26,32,33,38,45,48,49,52,53,55,62,65,83,84,92,93] have been proposed in the literature aiming at reducing manual debugging efforts through automatically generating patches. Beyond fixing syntactic errors, i.e., cases where the code violates some programming language specifications [16], the current challenges lie in fixing semantic bugs, i.e., cases where implementation of program behavior deviates from developer's intention [22,61].\nTen years ago, the work of Weimer et al. [83] was explicitly motivated by the fact that, despite significant advances in specification mining (e.g., [40]), formal specifications are rarely available. Thus, test suites represented an affordable approximation to program specifications. Unfortunately, the assumption that test cases are readily available still does not hold in practice [7,27,68]. Therefore, while current test-based APR approaches would be suitable in a test-driven development setting [6], their adoption by practitioners faces a simple reality: developers majoritarily (1) write few tests [27], (2) write tests after the source code [7], and (3) write tests to validate that bugs are indeed fixed and will not re\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}}
