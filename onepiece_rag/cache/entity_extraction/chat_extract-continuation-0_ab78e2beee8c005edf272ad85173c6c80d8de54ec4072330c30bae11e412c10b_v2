We use this dataset to validate our proposal. The Airport dataset consists of nodes representing airports, with edges indicating the existence of routes between two airports and labels reflecting the population of the respective country that the airport belongs to. In contrast, the PubMed and Cora datasets represent scientific papers as nodes, with edges indicating citations and labels corresponding to academic subfields. Additionally, the Disease and Airport datasets have imbalanced node labels, rendering accuracy an inadequate measure of model performance. Therefore, we use the F1 score as a more suitable measure for imbalanced datasets. Conversely, for the remaining datasets with balanced node classes, we use accuracy to evaluate the models. Furthermore, note that according to the official code of HGCN 5 , the data statistics for Disease in node classification and link prediction differ slightly, and we list them separately in Table 2 for clarity.\nHyperbolicity 𝛿 is a metric that quantifies how closely a graph resembles a tree structure, with lower values of 𝛿 indicating greater tree-like characteristics. A 𝛿 value of 0 corresponds to a tree, while higher hyperbolicity values indicate a less tree-like structure. The relationship between hyperbolicity and tree-like characteristics has been established in various studies, including [3,32,53].<h2>publication_ref</h2>['b2', 'b31', 'b52']<h2>figure_ref</h2>[]<h2>table_ref</h2>['tab_2']<h2>heading</h2>B HYPERBOLIC GEOMETRY<h2>text</h2>The geometry of a Riemannian manifold is defined by its curvature: elliptic geometry for positive curvature, Euclidean geometry for zero curvature, and hyperbolic geometry for negative curvature. In this study, we concentrate on the latter, i.e. hyperbolic geometry. There exist several equivalent hyperbolic models that exhibit diverse characteristics, yet are mathematically isometric. Our main focus will be on two extensively researched hyperbolic models.: the Poincaré ball model [56] and the Lorentz model (also known as the hyperboloid model) [57]. Let ∥.∥ be the Euclidean norm and ⟨., .⟩ L denote the Minkowski inner product, respectively. The two models are denoted by Definition B.1 and Definition B.2. A compilation of the formulas and operations associated with these models, such as distance, mapping, and parallel transport, is presented in Table 6. These operations include Möbius addition [75] denoted by ⊕ 𝜅 and the gyration operator [75] <h2>publication_ref</h2>['b55', 'b56', 'b74', 'b74']<h2>figure_ref</h2>[]<h2>table_ref</h2>['tab_7']<h2>heading</h2>C MORE ANALYSIS C.1 Computational Complexity of ORC<h2>text</h2>The computation of ORC is formulated as linear programming problems [18,46], and its computational complexity is 𝑂 (|𝐸|𝑑 3 max ), where 𝑑 max is the maximum degree of the graph. To illustrate the computational cost, we present the actual run-time on a machine with the environment Intel(R) Xeon(R) Gold 6132 CPU @ 2.60GHZ in TABLE 7. The results indicate that the time required for computing ORC is proportional to the size of the graph, and the cost for smaller graphs is correspondingly lower. Importantly, it is noteworthy that ORC only needs to be computed once prior to the training process, with the same computational complexity as HGCN [11] during both training and inference. To handle extremely large-scale graphs, approximation methods such as Sinkhorn [19] or Jaccard proxy [59] may be utilized. The efficacy of 𝜅HGCN and HGCN in learning representations for node classification is demonstrated through the visualization of their performance on the Disease and Cora datasets. To accomplish this, we employ the t-distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE) technique [77] to reduce the high-dimensional embeddings produced by the final layer of each model to a two-dimensional plane for visual examination. The results, shown in Figure 7, depict nodes as individual points, where each point is assigned a color that corresponds to its class. The visualization indicates that   <h2>publication_ref</h2>['b17', 'b45', 'b10', 'b18', 'b58', 'b76']<h2>figure_ref</h2>['fig_5']<h2>table_ref</h2>['tab_8']<h2>heading</h2>C.2 Embedding Visualization<h2>text</h2>= x ∈ R 𝑛 : ⟨x, x⟩ 2 < -1 𝜅 L 𝑛 𝜅 = x ∈ R 𝑛+1 : ⟨x, x⟩ L = 1 𝜅 Metric 𝑔 B𝜅 x = 𝜆 𝜅<h2>publication_ref</h2>[]<h2>figure_ref</h2>[]<h2>table_ref</h2>[]<h2>heading</h2>C.3 Curvature-wise Performance<h2>text</h2>The objective of the study is to perceive the local structure around nodes in tree-like graphs, encompassing local tree-like, zero-density, and densely connected structures.
