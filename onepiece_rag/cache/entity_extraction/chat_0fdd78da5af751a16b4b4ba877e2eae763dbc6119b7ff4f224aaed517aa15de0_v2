The remaining parameter pn will be defined through\npn •   1 - Pn-Kn Kn Pn Kn   = ln n + (k -1) ln ln n + αn n (40\n)\nso that pe = pn • 1 -\n( Pn -Kn Kn ) ( Pn Kn )\nsatisfies (36). Thus, it remains to establish (38).\nComparing (40) with (34), it follows that pn ≤ pn since Kn = Kn , Pn = Pn and αn ≤ αn . Consider graphs G on (n, Kn , Pn , pn ), G on (n, Kn , Pn , pn ) that have the same number of nodes n, the same key ring size Kn and the same key pool size Pn , but have different probabilities pn and pn for a link to be on. We will show that there exists a coupling such that G on (n, Kn , Pn , pn ) is a spanning subgraph of G on (n, Kn , Pn , pn ) so that, as shown by Rybarczyk [ \nfor any monotone increasingfoot_2 graph property P. The properties of being k-connected and having a minimum node degree of at least k can easily be seen to be monotone increasing graph properties. Therefore, (38) will follow immediately (with Kn = Kn and Pn = Pn ) if (41) holds. We now give the coupling argument that leads to (41). As seen from ( 3), G on is the intersection of a random key graph G(n, K n , P n ) and an Erdős-Rényi graph G(n, p n ). Using graph coupling, we use the same random key graph G(n, Kn , Pn ) to help construct both G on (n, Kn , Pn , pn ) and G on (n, Kn , Pn , pn ). Then we have\nG on (n, Kn , Pn , pn ) = G(n, Kn , Pn ) ∩ G(n, pn )(42)\nG on (n, Kn , Pn , pn ) = G(n, Kn , Pn ) ∩ G(n, pn ).(43)\nSince pn ≤ pn , we couple G(n, pn ) and G(n, pn ) in the following manner. Pick independent Erdős-Rényi graphs G(n, pn /p n ) and G(n, pn ) on the same vertex set. It is clear that the intersection G(n, pn /p n ) ∩ G(n, pn ) will still be an Erdős-Rényi graph (due to independence) with an edge probability given by pn • pn pn = pn . In other words, we have G(n, pn /p n ) ∩ G(n, pn ) = G(n, pn ). Consequently, under this coupling, G(n, pn ) is a spanning subgraph of G(n, pn ). Then from ( 42) and ( 43), G on (n, Kn , Pn , pn ) is a spanning subgraph of G on (n, Kn , Pn , pn ) and ( 41) follows. </p><h2>publication_ref</h2> <p>['b10', 'b11', 'b11', 'b6', 'b31', 'b37', 'b38', 'b37', 'b35', 'b37', 'b39', 'b33', 'b37', 'b40', 'b40'] </p><h2>figure_ref</h2> <p>[] </p><h2>table_ref</h2> <p>[] </p><h2>heading</h2> <p>C.
