Next, for the case where lim n→∞ p e n = 0, we will show that (51) and (53) hold for ℓ = 0. Assume now that p e n > ǫ > 0 for all n sufficiently large.

On that range, fix n, pick 0 < γ < 1 and consider the cases α n ≤ -(1γ) ln n and α n > -(1γ) ln n. In the former case, we have\nf n (k; α n ) ≥ ǫ • e -(k-1) ln ln n+(1-γ) ln n ,\nwhereas in the latter we obtain\nf n (k; α n ) ≥ (γ ln n) k-1 e -(k-1) ln ln n-αn = γ k-1 e -αn .\nThus, for all n sufficiently large, we have\nf n (k; α n ) ≥ min ǫ • e -(k-1) ln ln n+(1-γ) ln n , γ k-1 e -αn .\nIt is now easy to see that lim n→∞ f n (k; α n ) = ∞ since 0 < γ < 1 and lim n→∞ α n = -∞.
