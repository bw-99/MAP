Throughout this paper, k is a positive integer and does not scale with n. Also, we let N (resp., N 0 ) stand for the set of all non-negative (resp., positive) integers.\nWe refer to any pair of mappings K, P : N 0 ‚Üí N 0 as a scaling as long as it satisfies the natural conditions\nK n ‚â§ P n , n = 1, 2, . . . .(8)\nSimilarly, any mapping p : N 0 ‚Üí (0, 1) defines a scaling.\nTheorem 1. Consider scalings K, P : N 0 ‚Üí N 0 , p : N 0 ‚Üí (0, 1) such that K n ‚â• 2 for all n sufficiently large. We define a sequence Œ± : N 0 ‚Üí R such that for any n ‚àà N 0 , we have\np e = ln n + (k -1) ln ln n + Œ± n n .(9)\nThe properties (a) and (b) below hold. (a) If\nK 2 n Pn = o(1)\nand either there exists «´ > 0 such that p e n > «´ holds for all n sufficiently large or lim n‚Üí‚àû p e n = 0, then\nlim n‚Üí‚àû P [G on is k-connected ] = 0 if lim n‚Üí‚àû Œ± n = -‚àû,(10)\nand (12) and\nlim n‚Üí‚àû P Minimum node degree of G on is no less than k = 0 if lim n‚Üí‚àû Œ± n = -‚àû. (11\n) (b) If P n = ‚Ñ¶(n) and Kn Pn = o(1), then lim n‚Üí‚àû P [G on is k-connected ] = 1 if lim n‚Üí‚àû Œ± n = ‚àû,\nlim n‚Üí‚àû P Minimum node degree of G on is no less than k = 1 if lim n‚Üí‚àû Œ± n = ‚àû.(13)\nNote that if we combine (10) and (12), we obtain the zeroone law for k-connectivity in G on , whereas combining (11) and ( 13) leads to the zero-one law for the minimum node degree. Therefore, Theorem 1 presents the zero-one laws of k-connectivity and the minimum node degree in graph G on . We also see from (9) that the critical scaling for both properties is given by p e = ln n+(k-1) ln ln n n . The sequence Œ± n : N 0 ‚Üí R defined through (9) therefore measures by how much the probability p e deviates from the critical scaling.\nIn case (b) of Theorem 1, the conditions P n = ‚Ñ¶(n) and Kn Pn = o(1) indicate that the size of the key pool P n should grow at least linearly with the number of sensor nodes in the network, and should grow unboundedly with the size of each key ring. These conditions are enforced here merely for technical reasons, but they hold trivially in practical wireless sensor network applications [8], [9], [13]. Again, the condition 1) enforced for the zero-law in Theorem 1 is not a stringent one since the P n is expected to be several orders of magnitude larger than K n . Finally, the condition that either p e n > «´ > 0 for all n large or lim n‚Üí‚àû p e n = 0 is imposed to avoid degenerate situations. In most cases of interest it holds that p e n > «´ > 0 as otherwise the graph G on becomes trivially disconnected. To see this, notice that p e n is an upper-bound on the expected degree of a node and that the expected number of edges in the graph is less than p e n 2 ; yet, a connected graph on n nodes must have at least n -1 edges.\nK 2 n Pn = o( </p><h2>publication_ref</h2> <p>['b11', 'b9', 'b11', 'b10', 'b8', 'b8', 'b7', 'b8', 'b12'] </p><h2>figure_ref</h2> <p>[] </p><h2>table_ref</h2> <p>[] </p><h2>heading</h2> <p>B.

In fact, in the case of random key graph G(n, K n , P n ) it is a common practice [2], [32], [39] to replace p s by\nK 2 n\nPn , owing to the fact [39] that\np s ‚àº K 2 n P n if K 2 n P n = o(1).(14)\nHowever, when random key graph G(n, K n , P n ) is intersected with an ER graph G(n, p n ) (as in the case of G on ) the simplification does not occur naturally (even under ( 14)), and as seen below, simpler forms of the zero-one laws are obtained at the expense of extra conditions enforced on the parameters K n and P n .\nCorollary 1.
