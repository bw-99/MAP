The remaining part of this section is devoted to the proof of Lemma 5. Proof. We present the steps of proving Lemma 5 below. First, by a crude bounding argument, we get\nP [Œ∫ = ‚Ñì] ‚â§ P [(Œ∫ = ‚Ñì) ‚à© (Œ¥ > ‚Ñì)] + P [Œ¥ ‚â§ ‚Ñì] ,\nwhere Œ¥ is the minimum node degree of graph G on , as defined in Section V-D. We will prove Lemma 5 by establishing the following two results under the enforced assumptions:\nlim n‚Üí‚àû P [Œ¥ ‚â§ ‚Ñì] = 0 if lim n‚Üí‚àû Œ≤ ‚Ñì,n = +‚àû,(125)\nand\nlim n‚Üí‚àû P [Œ∫ = ‚Ñì ‚à© Œ¥ > ‚Ñì] = 0 if lim n‚Üí‚àû Œ≤ ‚Ñì,n = +‚àû.(126)\nWe first establish (125). First, from ‚Ñì ln ln n = o(ln n), Œ≤ ‚Ñì,n = o(ln n) and p e = ln n+‚Ñì ln ln n+Œ≤ ‚Ñì,n n\n, it is clear that p e ‚àº ln n n . Then p e = o 1 ‚àö n . Thus, from Lemmas 1 and 2, we get\nE X ‚Ñì = nP [D x,‚Ñì ] ‚àº n ‚Ä¢ (‚Ñì!) -1 (p e n) ‚Ñì e -pen .(127)\nSubstituting p e ‚àº ln n n and (120) into (127), we get\nE X ‚Ñì ‚àº n (‚Ñì!) -1 (ln n) ‚Ñì e -ln n-‚Ñì ln ln n-Œ≤ ‚Ñì,n = (‚Ñì!) -1 e -Œ≤ ‚Ñì,n .\nIn view of the fact that lim n‚Üí‚àû Œ≤ ‚Ñì,n = +‚àû, we thus obtain E X ‚Ñì = o(1). Then from property (a) of Fact 1 (Section V-C), we get\nlim n‚Üí‚àû P[Œ¥ = ‚Ñì] = 0.(128)\nAs seen from ( 121), Œ≤ ‚Ñì,n is decreasing in ‚Ñì. Thus, we have\nlim n‚Üí‚àû Œ≤ ‚Ñì ‚ãÜ ,n = +‚àû for each ‚Ñì ‚ãÜ = 0, 1, . . . , ‚Ñì. It is also im- mediate from (121) that Œ≤ ‚Ñì ‚ãÜ ,n = o(ln n) since Œ≤ ‚Ñì,n = o(ln n).\nTherefore, using the same arguments that lead to (128), we obtain\nlim n‚Üí‚àû P[Œ¥ = ‚Ñì ‚ãÜ ] = 0, ‚Ñì ‚ãÜ = 0, 1, . . . , ‚Ñì,\nand (125) follows immediately. As ( 125) is established, it remains to prove (126) in order to complete the proof of Lemma 5. The basic idea in establishing ( 126) is to find a sufficiently tight upper bound on the probability P [Œ∫ = ‚Ñì ‚à© Œ¥ > ‚Ñì] and then to show that this bound tends to zero as n goes to +‚àû. This approach is similar to the one used for proving the one-law for k-connectivity in Erd≈ës-R√©nyi graphs [12], as well as to the approach used by Yagan [37] to establish the one-law for connectivity in the graph G on .\nWe start by obtaining the needed upper bound. Let N denote the collection of all non-empty subsets of v 1 , . . . , v n . We define\nN * = T | T ‚àà N , |T | ‚â• 2 and K T = ‚à™ vi‚ààT S i .\nFor the reasons that will later become apparent we find it useful to introduce the event E(J ) in the following manner:\nE(J ) = T ‚ààN * |K T | ‚â§ J |T | ,(129)\nwhere J = [J 2 , J 3 , . . . , J n ] is an (n -1)-dimensional integer valued array. Let\nr n := min P n K n , n 2 . (130\n)\nWe define J i as follows:\nJ i = max‚åä(1 + Œµ)K n ‚åã , ‚åäŒªK n i‚åã i = 2, . . . , r n , ‚åä¬µP n ‚åã i = r n + 1, . . . , n.(131)\nfor some arbitrary constant 0 < Œµ < 1 and constants Œª, ¬µ in (0, 1 2 ) that will be specified later; see (134)-(135) below. By a crude bounding argument we now get\nP [(Œ∫ = ‚Ñì) ‚à© (Œ¥ > ‚Ñì)] ‚â§ P [E(J )] + P (Œ∫ = ‚Ñì) ‚à© (Œ¥ > ‚Ñì) ‚à© E(J ) .\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>LIMIT<|>concept<|>Limit refers to the value that a function approaches as the input approaches some value, often used in calculus and mathematical analysis.)\n(\"entity\"<|>PROBABILITY<|>concept<|>Probability is a measure of the likelihood that an event will occur, expressed as a number between 0 and 1.)\n(\"entity\"<|>K-CONNECTED<|>concept<|>K-connected refers to a property of a graph where there are at least k vertex-disjoint paths between any two vertices, indicating robustness in connectivity.)\n(\"entity\"<|>LEMMA 5<|>concept<|>Lemma 5 is a specific statement or proposition that is being proved in the context of the text, related to probabilities in graph theory.)\n(\"entity\"<|>NODE DEGREE<|>concept<|>Node degree is the number of edges connected to a node in a graph, indicating its connectivity and importance within the graph structure.)\n(\"entity\"<|>ERD≈êS-R√âNYI GRAPHS<|>concept<|>Erd≈ës-R√©nyi graphs are a type of random graph characterized by a fixed number of vertices and edges, used in probability theory and combinatorics.)\n(\"entity\"<|>PROOF<|>concept<|>Proof is a logical argument demonstrating the truth of a mathematical statement, often involving a series of deductions based on previously established results.)\n(\"relationship\"<|>LIMIT<|>PROBABILITY<|>Limits are often used in probability to describe the behavior of probabilities as certain parameters approach infinity or other critical values.<|>7)\n(\"relationship\"<|>K-CONNECTED<|>PROBABILITY<|>K-connectedness can be analyzed using probability to determine the likelihood of maintaining connectivity in a graph as it grows.<|>8)\n(\"relationship\"<|>LEMMA 5<|>PROOF<|>Lemma 5 is being proved in the text, indicating a direct relationship between the lemma and the proof process.<|>9)\n(\"relationship\"<|>NODE DEGREE<|>K-CONNECTED<|>Node degree is a critical factor in determining whether a graph is k-connected, as it affects the number of paths between nodes.<|>8)\n(\"relationship\"<|>ERD≈êS-R√âNYI GRAPHS<|>K-CONNECTED<|>The concept of k-connectedness is often explored within the framework of Erd≈ës-R√©nyi graphs, linking the two concepts in graph theory.<|>6)\n(\"relationship\"<|>PROOF<|>LEMMA 5<|>The proof involves establishing the validity of Lemma 5, showing a direct connection between the two concepts.<|>9) \n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
