An equivalent definition of k-connectivity is that a network is k-connected if the network remains connected despite the failure of any (k -1) nodes [29]; a network is said to be simply connected if it is 1-connected. kconnectivity is a fundamental graph property and is important for various applications of random key graphs. For example, in a WSN application where sensor nodes operate autonomously and physically unprotected, k-connectivity provides communication security against an adversary that is able to compromise up to k -1 links by launching a sensor capture attack [8]; i.e., two sensors can communicate securely as long as at least one of the k disjoint paths connecting them consists of links that are not compromised by the adversary. Also, k-connectivity improves resiliency against network disconnection due to battery depletion, in both normal mode of operation and under battery-depletion attacks [26]. Furthermore, it enables flexible communication-load balancing across multiple paths so that network energy consumption is distributed without penalizing any access path [15].\nOur main contributions are zero-one laws for two related graph properties for G on : i) the minimum node degree being at least k, and ii) k-connectivity. Namely, we present conditions on how to scale the model parameters K n , P n , p n such that these properties hold with probability approaching to one and zero, respectively, as the number of nodes n becomes large. Our main results also imply a zero-one law for k-connectivity in random key graph G(n, K n , P n ) (see Corollary 2), and the established result is shown to improve that given previously by Rybarczyk [32]; see Section IV-D for details. Moreover, for the 1-connectivity of G on , we provide a stronger form of the zero-one law as compared to that given by Yagan [37]; see Section IV-D.\nWe organize the rest of the paper as follows: In Section II, we survey the relevant results from the literature, while in Section III we give a detailed description of the system model G on . The main results of the paper are presented (see Theorem 1) in Section IV, with a detailed discussion and comparisons with the existing results given in Section IV-D; also, in Section IV-E we provide numerical results that confirm Theorem 1. The basic ideas that pave the way in establishing Theorem 1 are given in Section V. Sections VI through VIII are devoted to establishing the zero-law part of Theorem 1, whereas the one-law of Theorem 1 is established in Sections IX through XIII. The paper is concluded in Section XIV, and some of the technical details are given in Appendix A-C. </p><h2>publication_ref</h2> <p>['b1', 'b4', 'b7', 'b8', 'b12', 'b6', 'b17', 'b40', 'b26', 'b3', 'b18', 'b2', 'b34', 'b0', 'b37', 'b1', 'b6', 'b9', 'b13', 'b27', 'b33', 'b34', 'b1', 'b2', 'b5', 'b27', 'b31', 'b33', 'b44', 'b45', 'b16', 'b20', 'b30', 'b12', 'b10', 'b38', 'b40', 'b28', 'b7', 'b25', 'b14', 'b31', 'b36'] </p><h2>figure_ref</h2> <p>[] </p><h2>table_ref</h2> <p>[] </p><h2>heading</h2> <p>II. RELATED WORK </p><h2>text</h2> <p>Erd≈ës and R√©nyi [11] and Gilbert [16] introduces the random graph G(n, p), which is defined on n nodes and there exists an edge between any two nodes with probability p independently of all other edges. The probability p can also be a function of n, in which case we refer to it as p n . Throughout the paper, we refer to the random graph G(n, p n ) as an Erd≈ës-R√©nyi (ER) graph following the convention in the literature.\nErd≈ës and R√©nyi [11] prove that when p n is ln n+Œ±n n , graph G(n, p n ) is asymptotically almost surely 1 (a.a.s.) connected (resp., not connected) if lim n‚Üí‚àû Œ± n = +‚àû (resp., lim n‚Üí‚àû Œ± n = -‚àû). In later work [12], they further explore k-connectivity [30] in G(n, p n ) and show that if p n = 1 We say that an event takes place asymptotically almost surely if its probability approaches to 1 as n ‚Üí ‚àû. Also, we use \"resp.\" as a shorthand for \"respectively\".\nln n+(k-1) ln ln n+Œ±n n\n, G(n, p n ) is a.a.s. k-connected (resp., not k-connected) if lim n‚Üí‚àû Œ± n = +‚àû (resp., lim n‚Üí‚àû Œ± n = -‚àû).\nPrevious work [2], [32], [39] investigates the zero-one law for connectivity in random key graph G(n, K n , P n ), where P n and K n are the key pool size and the key ring size, respectively.
