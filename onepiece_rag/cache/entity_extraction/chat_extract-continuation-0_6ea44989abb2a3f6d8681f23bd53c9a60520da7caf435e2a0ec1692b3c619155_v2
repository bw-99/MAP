Note that it is always the case that\n| ∪ i∈νr,j S i | ≥ K n 1 [|ν r,j | > 0] .(152)\nAlso, on the event E(J ), we have\n| ∪ i∈νr,j S i | ≥ J |νr,j| + 1 • 1 [|ν r,j | > 1](153)\nfor each j = r +ℓ+1, . . . , n. Finally, we note the crude bound\n| ∪ i∈νr,j S i | ≤ |ν r,j |K n (154\n)\nfor each j = 1, . . . , ℓ.\nConditioning on the rvs S ℓ+1 , . . . , S r+ℓ and {C ij , i, j = ℓ + 1, . . . , ℓ + r} (which determine the event C r ), we conclude via (152)-(154) that\nP A ℓ,r ∩ E(J ) = P C r ∩ B ℓ,r ∩ D ℓ,r ∩ E(J ) ≤ E     1 [C r ] × ℓ j=1 1 - ( Pn -Kn |ν r,j | Kn ) ( Pn Kn ) × × n j=r+ℓ+1 ( Pn -L(ν r,j ) Kn ) ( Pn Kn )     ,\nwhere for notational convenience we have set\nL(ν r,j ) = max {K n • 1 [|ν r,j | > 0] , (155\n) (J |νr,j | + 1) • 1 [|ν r,j | > 1] .\nIt is immediate that the rvs {|ν r,j |} n j=r+1+ℓ (as well as {|ν r,j |} ℓ j=1 ) are independent and identically distributed. Let ν r denote a generic random variable identically distributed with ν r,j , j = 1, . . . , ℓ, r + ℓ + 1, . . . , n. Then, we have\n|ν r | = st Bin(r, p n ). (156\n)\nwhere we use the notation = st to indicate distributional equality. Then, we define L(|ν r |) as follows:\nL(ν r ) = max K n • 1 [|ν r | > 0] , (J |νr | + 1) • 1 [|ν r | > 1] .(157)\nObserve that the event C r is independent from the set-valued random variables ν r,j for each j = 1, . . . , ℓ and for each j = r + ℓ + 1, . . . , n. Also, as noted before {|ν r,j |} n j=r+1+ℓ (as well as {|ν r,j |} ℓ j=1 ) are independent and identically distributed. Using these we obtain\nP A ℓ,r ∩ E(J ) ≤ P [C r ] × E 1 - Pn-Kn|νr | Kn Pn Kn ℓ × E Pn-L(νr) Kn Pn Kn n-r-ℓ . (158\n)\nWe will give sufficiently tight bounds for each term appearing in the R.H.S. of (158). First, note from Lemma 11 (Appendix A-B) that ≤ min e -pe(1+ε/2) , e -peλr + e -Knµ 1 [r > r n ]\nP [C r ] ≤ r r-2 p r-1 e , r=\nfor all n sufficiently large and for each r = 2, 3, . . . , n.\nSubstituting the bounds (159), ( 161) and ( 162) into (158), and noting that each of the terms in the RHS of (158) are trivially upper bounded by 1, we obtain the key bounds on the probabilities P A ℓ,r ∩ E(J ) that are summarized in the following Lemma. Lemma 6. With J defined in (131) for some ε, λ and µ in (0, 1  2 ), if Kn Pn = o(1) and p e = o(1), then the following two properties hold.\n(a) For all n sufficiently large and for each r = 2, 3, . . . , Pn-Kn 2Kn , we have\nP A ℓ,r ∩ E(J ) ≤ r r-2 (p e ) r-1 • (2rp e ) ℓ\n× min e -pe(1+ε/2) , e -peλr + e -Knµ 1 [r > r n ] n-r-ℓ .\n(b) For all n sufficiently large and for each r = 2, 3, . . . , n, we have\nP A ℓ,r ∩ E(J ) ≤ min r r-2 (p e ) r-1 , 1 × min e -pe(1+ε/2) , e -peλr + e -Knµ 1 [r > r n ] n\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>νr,j<|>CONCEPT<|>νr,j represents a random variable that is part of a distributional analysis in the context of bounding probabilities in statistical models.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>P<|>CONCEPT<|>P denotes a probability measure used in the context of statistical events and random variables.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>E(J)<|>EVENT<|>E(J) is an event defined in the context of the statistical analysis, which is dependent on the random variables involved.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>C_r<|>CONCEPT<|>C_r is a specific event related to the random variables that is independent from the set-valued random variables νr,j.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>A<|>CONCEPT<|>A is a notation used to represent a specific event in the probability analysis.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>K_n<|>CONCEPT<|>K_n is a parameter that appears in the bounds of the probabilities being analyzed.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>L(ν_r)<|>CONCEPT<|>L(ν_r) is a function defined to provide bounds based on the random variable ν_r.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>r<|>CONCEPT<|>r is an index used in the context of the statistical analysis, representing a count or position in a sequence.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>n<|>CONCEPT<|>n is a parameter representing the total number of observations or trials in the statistical model.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>p<|>CONCEPT<|>p is a parameter representing a probability in the context of the statistical analysis.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>λ<|>CONCEPT<|>λ is a parameter used in the bounds of the probabilities, often representing a rate or intensity in statistical models.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>μ<|>CONCEPT<|>μ is a parameter representing a mean or expected value in the context of the statistical analysis.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>νr,j<|>P<|>νr,j is a random variable that contributes to the calculation of probabilities P in the statistical analysis<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>E(J)<|>C_r<|>E(J) is an event that is analyzed in relation to the event C_r in the statistical model<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>C_r<|>A<|>C_r is an event that is part of the broader analysis involving the event A<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>K_n<|>L(ν_r)<|>K_n is a parameter that influences the bounds provided by the function L(ν_r)<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>r<|>n<|>r is an index that is used in relation to the total number of observations n in the statistical model<|>4)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>p<|>λ<|>p and λ are parameters that are used together in the bounds of the probabilities<|>3)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>p<|>μ<|>p and μ are parameters that are often used together in statistical analysis<|>3)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
