The pie chart can clearly show the percentage of each factor in importance, but again the relative position of the same factor can vary a lot in different units, making it hard to compare the evolution of the same factor. iQUANT is designed for financial factor selection, which makes it inevitable to consider much domain knowledge and incorporate different factors in our design. This can increase the design complexity and it takes some time for user to learn, but most of our users can be well prepared after a training session of about 10 minutes as indicated in Section 6.3, which we would argue is a reasonable learning effort.<h2>publication_ref</h2>['b19']<h2>figure_ref</h2>['fig_2', 'fig_2', 'fig_7', 'fig_7']<h2>table_ref</h2>[]<h2>heading</h2>Factor List<h2>text</h2>Factor list (Figure 2(d)) aggregates factor data together to depict the overall factor performance (T2). The six types of factors are listed in rows, with factors in one type uniformly distributed as factor bars in the same row. Each factor bar the positive and negative contribution of the factor in the entire time period, using the height of the bar above and below the x-axis respectively. Users can manually select factors by clicking factor bars, then the stock prediction models are re-built using the selected factors after triggering the \"Draw\" button. The factor performance in the stock view is also updated for iterative factor/stock selection. (T3)<h2>publication_ref</h2>[]<h2>figure_ref</h2>['fig_2']<h2>table_ref</h2>[]<h2>heading</h2>Stock Return View<h2>text</h2>Stock return view (Figure 2(e)) is organized by sectors. In each expandable sector box, the investment returns of all stocks in that sector are calculated by backtesting and displayed in multiple grey line charts. An additional blue line indicates the market return. Users could select promising stocks in the stock view and examine their returns by the lines highlighted in red. The stocks could be selected in the return view and added into a portfolio table. A \"Backtest\" button will trigger the backtesting computation by the selected factors (factor list) and selected stocks (portfolio table).<h2>publication_ref</h2>[]<h2>figure_ref</h2>['fig_2']<h2>table_ref</h2>[]<h2>heading</h2>Backtesting View<h2>text</h2>Backtesting view (Figure 2(f)) evaluates the investment performance of the selected portfolio (T4). Backtesting calculates the portfolio returns using historical stock data. The blue line indicates the average return in the market and the grey one indicates the portfolio return. A dotted line after the selected time period represents the predicted return in future. Comparison among multiple portfolios is enabled by adding more portfolio from the stock return view.<h2>publication_ref</h2>[]<h2>figure_ref</h2>['fig_2']<h2>table_ref</h2>[]<h2>heading</h2>Multiple Views Interaction<h2>text</h2>iQUANT supports interactions among multiple views for comprehensive evaluation of factor performance (T2) and interactive selection of stocks and factors (T3).\nSelection of factors: Users can select/de-select factors by clicking factor circles in the factor view, Voronoi regions in the stock view, and factor bars in the factor list. Each change to the factor selection will trigger updates in all the views simultaneously.\nSelection of stocks: An initial collection of stocks can be selected in the control panel. Users can further compose an investment portfolio by clicking the stock name in the stock view or the return curve in the stock return view. This helps to interactively and iteratively refine stock selection according to their returns or the performance of relevant factors.<h2>publication_ref</h2>[]<h2>figure_ref</h2>[]<h2>table_ref</h2>[]<h2>heading</h2>User Experiment<h2>text</h2><h2>publication_ref</h2>[]<h2>figure_ref</h2>[]<h2>table_ref</h2>[]<h2>heading</h2>Design<h2>text</h2>We conducted a formal user study to compare the effectiveness of iQUANT visualization design with a baseline factor visualization using commodity multiple line charts (See the supplementary material for more details of the baseline factor visualization used). Since there is no efficient tool that can fulfill the tasks mentioned in Task Characterization, we chose to compare iQUANT with the widelyused line charts in the stock market. In both designs, the time series of financial factors and stock prices were displayed. Users were required to complete multiple tasks involving the selection of factors and stocks for investment, which corresponded well with T1∼T3 in Task Characterization. In total, 14 expert quantitative traders were recruited as subjects, who were paid for their valuable time. We applied a between-subject design that subjects were randomly assigned to two groups of equal size. The seven subjects in each group will complete all the tasks with only one visualization, iQUANT or baseline. The experiment was composed of two sessions. In the first training session, subjects were presented with a tutorial and allowed a trial usage of iQUANT to be tested. In the subsequent formal test session, each subject took seven tasks. To alleviate the influence of financial data on the result and increase statistical power, we presented two stock data. Each subject was required to complete all the tasks with both data using the tested visualization.
