On the other hand, the second recommended route travel time is 7 minutes with a distance of 1.4 Km. Thus according to Google maps suggestions which are mainly provided based on less trip time and shortest route distances, Route 1 is recommended as shown figure.6.\nConsequently, as requested by the driver, the safe and high road quality has the highest priority in the trip satisfaction. For this regard, iDriveSense examined the quality of the road segments in the potential routes as listed Table 1 and shown in fig. 7. With the aid of the first FIS system described in Sec. II., the road segments quality of Route 1 and Route 2 were assessed. The first route (suggested by Google Maps) has nine road segments.   In this route, there are eight segments assessed as poor quality ones, and there is only one segment assessed as a moderate one. On the other hand, the second recommended route (Route 2) consists of 10 segments. Utilizing the first FIS, 5 of the road segments within this route are evaluated as good ones, and there were other four assessed as moderate while only one is considered a poor road segment. As per fig. 7, the assessed road segments of Route 1 and Route 2 are highlighted with different colors to indicate different levels of quality.\nAfterward, the route suggestion FIS was adopted to recommend the route with high road segments quality. In this cascaded FIS, the output of the first FIS along with the trip time and route distance in each route is used to set the routes recommendation levels. Given the predefined fuzzy rules, the three inputs and the required priority to the route with high road segments quality, iDrivesense contrary to Google Maps has recommended Route 2 as shown in fig. 8  Comprehensively, the presented results show the significance of considering road information quality in dynamic route planning. As the requests for safety and comfort trips have introduced new metrics in route suggestions. Thus iDrivesense showed high capabilities in providing dynamic, safe and comfortable trips. However, roads quality are subject to change due to the effects of traffic and harsh weather. To sustain reliable dynamic route planning, continuous road segments assessments are enabled by iDrivesense. </p><h2>publication_ref</h2> <p>[] </p><h2>figure_ref</h2> <p>['fig_2', 'fig_3', 'fig_4', 'fig_4'] </p><h2>table_ref</h2> <p>[] </p><h2>heading</h2> <p>IV. CONCLUSION </p><h2>text</h2> <p>Future smart cities are required to consider numerous aspects to meet the expectations of their residents. Smooth and safe vehicle routing come on the top of the resident's demands due to their implications for their comfort and productivity on a daily bases. However, the popular route planning systems and service providers are not considering the road quality information while providing their trip planning services. In this paper, we presented \"iDriveSense\" a crowdsensing based system to enable such challenging demand. Our system benefits from the sensing capabilities of the vehicle motion sensors and the inertial sensors and GPS receivers to monitor road surface conditions. Accordingly, provides a cloud-based dynamic route planning services. The system was successfully able to operate independently or cooperatively with route planning service providers as Google Maps. The system can adequately asses the quality of road segments considering various aspects that affect the drivers' comfort and safety enabling efficient dynamic route planning while maintaining reasonable trip times and route distances. . </p><h2>publication_ref</h2> <p>[] </p><h2>figure_ref</h2> <p>[] </p><h2>table_ref</h2> <p>[] </p>\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}}
