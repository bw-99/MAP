(17\n)\n2 For original HGNNs, the 𝜅 can be replaced with degree-based weight or attentionbased weight.\nWe completely expand it:\nz 𝑢 = 1 𝐾 𝑢𝑢 ∑︁ 𝑗 ∈ N (𝑢 ) exp( κ𝑖,𝑗 ) * • • • * 1 𝐾 𝑜𝑜 ∑︁ 𝑝 ∈ N (𝑜 )\nexp( κ𝑜,𝑝 )z 𝑝 .\n(18) Node influences 𝐼 𝑢,𝑣 of 𝑣 on 𝑢 in the message passing output is 𝐼 𝑢,𝑣 = ∥𝜕z 𝑢 /𝜕z 𝑣 ∥, where the norm is any subordinate norm and the node influence measures how a change in 𝑣 passes to a change in 𝑢. By equation (18), the node influence can be computed as:\n𝐼 𝑢,𝑣 = ∥ 𝜕z 𝑢 𝜕z 𝑣 ∥ = ∥ 𝜕 𝜕z 𝑣 ( 1 𝐾 𝑢𝑢 ∑︁ 𝑗 ∈ N (𝑢 ) exp( κ𝑖,𝑗 ) * • • • * 1 𝐾 𝑜𝑜 ∑︁ 𝑝 ∈ N (𝑜 ) exp( κ𝑜,𝑝 )z 𝑝 ) ∥. (19)\nThe partial derivative of the nodes in Equation ( 19) is zero if they are not on the path between node 𝑢 and 𝑣, and then the feature influence can be decomposed into the sum influence of all related paths. Suppose there are 𝑛 paths between 𝑢 and 𝑣, then\n𝐼 𝑢,𝑣 = 𝜕 𝜕z 𝑣 𝐼 𝑝 1 + • • • + 𝐼 𝑝 𝑖 • • • + 𝐼 𝑝 𝑛 ,(20)\nwhere\n𝐼 𝑝 𝑖 = 1 𝐾 𝑢𝑢 exp( κ𝑢,𝑝 𝑖 𝑗 ) • • • 1 𝐾 𝑝 𝑖 𝑛 𝑖 𝑝 𝑖 𝑛 𝑖 exp( κ𝑝 𝑖 𝑛 𝑖 ,𝑣 ) 𝑆 (𝐼 𝑝 𝑖 ) z 𝑣 .\nNote that, in Equation ( 20), the scalar term 𝑆 (𝐼 𝑝 𝑖 ) ranges from (0, 1] and all 𝐼 𝑝 𝑖 (1 ≤ 𝑖 ≤ 𝑛) have the term 𝑚 𝑣 , thus we separate 𝑆 (𝐼 𝑝 𝑖 ) and the rest derivative term and then uses the absolute homogeneous property, i.e., ∥𝛼𝑀 ∥ = |𝛼 |∥𝑀 ∥\n𝐼 𝑢,𝑣 = 𝑆 (𝐼 𝑝 1 ) + • • • + 𝑆 (𝐼 𝑝 𝑖 ) • • • + 𝑆 (𝐼 𝑝 𝑛 ) ∥ 𝜕𝑧 𝑣 𝜕𝑧 𝑣 ∥ = 𝑆 (𝐼 𝑝 1 ) + • • • + 𝑆 (𝐼 𝑝 𝑖 ) • • • + 𝑆 (𝐼 𝑝 𝑛 ) ≤ |𝑛 * max(𝑆 (𝐼 𝑝 𝑖 ))| = |𝑛 * 𝛾 𝑛 𝑖 | ≤ |𝑛 * 𝛾 𝑑 * 𝑔 | = 𝐶𝛾 𝑑 * 𝑔 ,(21)\nwhere 𝑑 𝑔 is the shortest path between 𝑢 and 𝑣, 𝑑 * ≤ 𝑛 𝑖 and 0 < 𝛾 ≤ 1, thus the second inequality holds on in Equation (21). For more generality, we use constant 𝐶 to denote the 𝑛. The condition for equality is if and only if 𝑑 * 𝑔 = 1 and the 𝑣 is the unique neighbor of node 𝑢, i.e., 𝛾 = 1 and 𝐶 = 1. □ Theorem 4.3 shows that the node influence using HMP exponentially decays as the shortest graph distance 𝑑 * 𝑔 between two nodes increases. In other words, distant nodes in dense areas will have less interaction, even if they are in a dense connected area. To alleviate the phenomenon, we propose a Curvature-based Homophily Constraint (𝜅HC) to enhance the connection within linked pairs. The basic idea is to push the embeddings of linked nodes closer if their ORC value is larger than a threshold. In this way, we can enforce disjoint node pairs in dense areas or clusters to have more Table 1:\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}}
