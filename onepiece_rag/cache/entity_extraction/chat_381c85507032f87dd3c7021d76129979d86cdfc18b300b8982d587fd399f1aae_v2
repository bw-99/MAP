These investigations must start with a thorough dissection of plausible patches for a deep understanding of plausibility factors. More sophisticated approaches to triaging and selecting fix ingredients are necessary: In its current form, iFixR implements a na√Øve approach to patch generation, ensuring that the performance is tractable. However, the literature already includes novel APR techniques that implement strategies for selecting donor code and filters patterns. Integrating such techniques into iFixR may lead to performance improvement. More comprehensive benchmarks are needed: Due to bug linking challenges, our experiments were only performed on half of the Defects4J benchmark. To drive strong research in patch generation for user-reported bugs, the community must build larger and reliable benchmarks, potentially even linking several artifacts of continuous integration (i.e, build logs, past execution traces, etc.). In the future, we plan to investigate the dataset of Bugs.jar [71]. Automatic test generation techniques could be used as a supplement: Our study tries to cope radically with the incompleteness of test suites. In the future, however, we could investigate the use of automatic test generation techniques to supplement the regression test cases during patch validation.\nThreats to external validity: The bug reports used in this study may be of low quality (i.e., wrong links for corresponding bugs). We reduced this threat by focusing only on bugs from the Lang and Math projects, which kept a single issue tracking system. We also manually verified the links between the bug reports and the Defects4J bugs. Table 13 characterizes the bug reports of our dataset following the criteria enumerated by Zimmermann et al. [100] in their study of \"what makes a good bug report\". Notably, as illustrated by the distribution of comments in Figure 8, we note that the bug reports have been actively discussed before being resolved. This suggests that they are not trivial cases (cf. [17] on measuring bug report significance). Code-related terms such as package/class names found in the summary and description, in addition to stack traces and code blocks, as separate features referred to as hints. Another threat to external validity relates to the diversity of the fix patterns used in this study. iFixR currently may not implement a reasonable number of relevant fix patterns. We minimize this threat by surveying the literature and considering patterns from several pattern-based APR. Threats to internal validity: Our implementation of fine-grained IRFL carries some threats: during the search of buggy statements, we considered top-50 suspicious buggy files from the file-level IRFL tool, to limit the search space. Different threshold values may lead to different results. We also considered only 5 statement types as more bug-prone. This second threat is minimized by the empirical evidence provided by Liu et al. [47].\nAdditionally, another internal threat is in our patch generation steps: iFixR only searches for donor code from the local code files, which contain the buggy statement. The adequate fix ingredient may however be located elsewhere. Threats to construct validity: In this study, we assumed that patch construction and test case creation are two separated tasks for developers. This may not be the case in practice. The threat is however mitigated given that, in any case, we have shown that the test cases are often unavailable when the bug is reported. </p><h2>publication_ref</h2> <p>['b82', 'b0', 'b70', 'b99', 'b16', 'b46'] </p><h2>figure_ref</h2> <p>['fig_8', 'fig_9'] </p><h2>table_ref</h2> <p>['tab_16'] </p><h2>heading</h2> <p>RELATED WORK </p><h2>text</h2> <p>Fault Localization. As stated in a recent study [48], fault localization is a critical task affecting the effectiveness of automated program repair. Several techniques have been proposed [67,80,88] and they use different information such as spectrum [4], text [85], slice [58], and statistics [42]. The first two types of techniques are widely studies in the community. SBFL techniques [3,20] are widely adopted in APR pipelines since they identify bug positions at a fine-grained level (i.e., statements). However, they have limitations on localizing buggy locations since it highly relies on the test suite [48]. Information retrieval based fault localization (IRFL) [41] leverages textual information in a bug report. It is mainly used to help developers narrow down suspected buggy files in the absence of relevant test cases. For the purpose of our study, we have proposed an algorithm for further localizing the faulty code entities at the statement level. Patch Generation. Patch generation is another key process of APR pipeline, which is, in other words, a task searching for another shape of a program (i.e., a patch) in the space of all possible programs [37,54]. To improve repair performance, many APR systems have been explored to address the search space problem by using different information and approaches: stochastic mutation [38,83], synthesis [53,92,93], pattern [14,18,19,26,32,36,49,51,52,73], contract [12,82], symbolic execution [65], learning [8,16,55,70,77,86], and donor code searching [25,62]. In this paper, patch generation is implemented with fix patterns presented in the literature since it may make the generated patches more robust [74]. Patch Validation. The ultimate goal of APR systems is to automatically generate a correct patch that can actually resolve the program defects\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}}
