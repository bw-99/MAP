Out of all the hyperparameters, this seems to be the critical one in achieving high recall. In practice, latency constraints can be considered when selecting the number of embeddings per user, explicitly making the trade-off between diversity and latency.    </p><h2>publication_ref</h2> <p>[] </p><h2>figure_ref</h2> <p>['fig_3', 'fig_3'] </p><h2>table_ref</h2> <p>[] </p><h2>heading</h2> <p>Conclusions </p><h2>text</h2> <p>We present kNN-Embed, a method of transforming single user dense embeddings, into mixtures of embeddings, with the goal of better modeling user interests, increasing retrieval recall and diversity. This multi-embedding scheme represents a source entity with multiple distinct topical affinities by globally clustering items and aggregating the source entity's engagements with clusters. Recognizing that user-item engagements may often be sparse, we propose a nearest-neighbor smoothing to enrich these mixture representation. Our smoothed mixture representation better models user preferences retrieving a diverse set of candidate items reflective of a user's multiple interests. This significantly improves recall on candidate retrieval tasks on three datasets including Twitter-Follow, a dataset we curate and release to the community. </p><h2>publication_ref</h2> <p>[] </p><h2>figure_ref</h2> <p>[] </p><h2>table_ref</h2> <p>[] </p><h1>references</h1><h2>ref_id</h2> <p>b0 </p><h2>title</h2> <p>Near-optimal hashing algorithms for approximate nearest neighbor in high dimensions </p><h2>journal</h2> <p> </p><h2>year</h2> <p>2006 </p><h2>authors</h2> <p>A Andoni; P Indyk </p><h2>ref_id</h2> <p>b1 </p><h2>title</h2> <p>k-means++: The advantages of careful seeding </p><h2>journal</h2> <p> </p><h2>year</h2> <p>2006 </p><h2>authors</h2> <p>D Arthur; S Vassilvitskii </p><h2>ref_id</h2> <p>b2 </p><h2>title</h2> <p>Scaling up all pairs similarity search </p><h2>journal</h2> <p>WWW </p><h2>year</h2> <p>2007 </p><h2>authors</h2> <p>R Bayardo; Y Ma; R Srikant </p><h2>ref_id</h2> <p>b3 </p><h2>title</h2> <p>Translating embeddings for modeling multi-relational data </p><h2>journal</h2> <p>NeurIPS </p><h2>year</h2> <p>2013 </p><h2>authors</h2> <p>A Bordes; N Usunier; A Garcia-Duran; J Weston; O Yakhnenko </p><h2>ref_id</h2> <p>b4 </p><h2>title</h2> <p>Deep neural networks for youtube recommendations </p><h2>journal</h2> <p> </p><h2>year</h2> <p>2016 </p><h2>authors</h2> <p>P Covington; J Adams; E Sargin </p><h2>ref_id</h2> <p>b5 </p><h2>title</h2> <p>Concept decompositions for large sparse text data using clustering </p><h2>journal</h2> <p>Machine learning </p><h2>year</h2> <p>2001 </p><h2>authors</h2> <p>I Dhillon; D Modha </p><h2>ref_id</h2> <p>b6 </p><h2>title</h2> <p>Massively multilingual document alignment with crosslingual sentence-mover's distance </p><h2>journal</h2> <p> </p><h2>year</h2> <p>2020 </p><h2>authors</h2> <p>A El-Kishky; F Guzmán </p><h2>ref_id</h2> <p>b7 </p><h2>title</h2> <p>Twhin: Embedding the twitter heterogeneous information network for personalized recommendation </p><h2>journal</h2> <p>KDD </p><h2>year</h2> <p>2022 </p><h2>authors</h2> <p>A El-Kishky; T Markovich; S Park </p><h2>ref_id</h2> <p>b8 </p><h2>title</h2> <p>Overview of the 2003 kdd cup </p><h2>journal</h2> <p> </p><h2>year</h2> <p>2003 </p><h2>authors</h2> <p>J Gehrke; P Ginsparg; J Kleinberg </p><h2>ref\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}}
