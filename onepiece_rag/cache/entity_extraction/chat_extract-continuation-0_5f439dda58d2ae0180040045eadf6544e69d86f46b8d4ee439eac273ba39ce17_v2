We will repeatedly exploit this \"locality implies similarity\" property of embeddings in this paper to resolve this diversity issue.\nClustering Items: Since neighboring items are similar in the embedding space, if we apply a distance-based clustering to items, we can arrive at groupings that represent individual user preferences well. As such, we first cluster items using spherical k-means [6] where cluster centroids are placed on a high-dimensional sphere with radius one. Given these item clusters, instead of immediately collapsing the distribution p(i k |u j ) to a few items as ANN search does, we can write the full distribution p(i k |u j ) as a mixture over item clusters:\np(i k |u j ) = c p(c|u j ) ‚Ä¢ p(i k |u j , c)\nwhere in each cluster, we learn a separate distribution over the items in the cluster p(i k |u j , c). Thus, we are modeling each user's higher level interests p(c|u), and then within each interest c, we can apply an efficient ANN-search strategy as before. In effect, we are interpolating between sampling the full preference distribution p(i k |u j ) and greedily selecting a few items in an ANN. </p><h2>publication_ref</h2> <p>['b5'] </p><h2>figure_ref</h2> <p>[] </p><h2>table_ref</h2> <p>[] </p><h2>heading</h2> <p>Mixture of Embeddings via Cluster Engagements: </p><h2>text</h2> <p>After clustering target entities, we learn p(c|u j ) through its maximum likelihood estimator (MLE):\np mle (c|u j ) = count(u i , c)/ c ‚Ä≤ ‚ààMj count(u j , c ‚Ä≤ )(3)\nwhere, count(u j , c) is the number of times u j has a relevant item in cluster c. For computational efficiency, we take M j to be u j 's top m most relevant clusters. We normalize these counts to obtain a proper cluster-relevance distribution.\nNearest Neighbor Smoothing: Unfortunately, we typically have few user-item engagements on a per-user basis; thus, while the MLE is unbiased and asymptotically efficient, it can also be high variance. To this end, we introduce a smoothing technique that once again exploits locality in the ANN search, this time for users. Figure 1 illustrates identifying k nearest-neighbors (K j ) to the query user u j 's, and leveraging the information from the neighbors' cluster engagements to augment the user's cluster relevance. We compute this distribution over item clusters by averaging the MLE probability for each nearest neighbor (item clusters that are not engaged with by a retrieved neighbor have zero probability).\np k N N (c|u j ) = 1 |K j | u ‚Ä≤ ‚ààKj p mle (c|u ‚Ä≤ )(4)\nWe apply Jelinik-Mercer smoothing to interpolate between a user's MLE distribution with the aggregated nearest neighbor distribution [12].\np smoothed (c|u j ) = (1 -Œª)p mle (c|u j ) + Œªp k N N (c|u j ),(5)\nwhere Œª ‚àà [0, 1] represents how much smoothing is applied. It can be manually set or tuned on a downstream extrinsic task. Fig. 1: Example of retrieving two candidates. In an ANN, items 4 and 5 would be deterministically returned for user 1. In our proposed kNN-Embed, even though the distances to cluster 2 are larger, smoothing means that we will sometimes return items from that cluster, yielding more diverse items. Note in this case, we don't even require that user 1 has previously relevant items in cluster 2.\nSampling within Clusters Within each cluster there are many ways to retrieve items on a per user basis. A simple, but appealing, strategy is to represent each user as a normalized centroid of their relevant items in that cluster:\ncentroid(c, u j ) = m‚ààR(c,uj ) i m ‚à• m‚ààR(c,uj ) i m ‚à• ,(6)\nwhere R(c, u j ) is the set of relevant items for user u j in cluster c. However, since we are applying smoothing to the cluster probabilities p(c|u j ), it may be case that u j has zero relevant items in a given cluster. Hence, we smooth the user centroid using neighbor infomation to obtain the final user representation u c j :\nu c j = (1 -Œª) centroid(c, u j ) + Œª |K j | u ‚Ä≤ ‚ààKj p mle (c|u ‚Ä≤ ) centroid(c, u ‚Ä≤ )(7)\nEquation 7 shows the kNN-smoothed user-specific embedding for cluster c. This embedding takes the user-specific cluster representations from Equation 6, and performs a weighted averaging proportionate to each user's contribution to p smoothed (c|u j ). The final vector is once again normalized to unit norm. </p><h2>publication_ref</h2> <p>['b11'] </p><h2>figure_ref</h2> <p>[] </p><h2>table_ref</h2> <p>[] </p><h2>heading</h2> <p>Evaluation Datasets and Metrics </p><h2>text</h2> <p>We evaluate on three datasets which we describe below: </p><h2>publication_ref</h2> <p>[] </p><h2>figure_ref</h2> <p>[] </p\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>LOCALITY IMPLIES SIMILARITY<|>concept<|>The principle that items close in space within an embedding space tend to be similar, which is exploited to resolve diversity issues in recommendations.)\n(\"entity\"<|>CLUSTERING ITEMS<|>concept<|>Clustering items involves grouping similar items based on their proximity in the embedding space, allowing for better representation of user preferences.)\n(\"entity\"<|>SPHERICAL K-MEANS<|>concept<|>Spherical k-means is a clustering algorithm that places cluster centroids on a high-dimensional sphere, used to group items in the embedding space.)\n(\"entity\"<|>MIXTURE OF EMBEDDINGS<|>concept<|>A mixture of embeddings refers to representing user preferences as a mixture over item clusters rather than collapsing them into a few items.)\n(\"entity\"<|>MAXIMUM LIKELIHOOD ESTIMATOR (MLE)<|>concept<|>MLE is a statistical method used to estimate the parameters of a probability distribution, applied here to learn user preferences in clusters.)\n(\"entity\"<|>NEAREST NEIGHBOR SMOOTHING<|>concept<|>A technique that uses information from a user's nearest neighbors to augment the user's cluster relevance, addressing the issue of high variance in MLE.)\n(\"entity\"<|>JELINIK-MERCER SMOOTHING<|>concept<|>Jelinik-Mercer smoothing is a method used to interpolate between different probability distributions, applied to smooth user preference distributions.)\n(\"entity\"<|>USER CENTROID<|>concept<|>The user centroid represents a normalized vector of relevant items for a user within a cluster, used to retrieve items based on user preferences.)\n(\"entity\"<|>USER-SPECIFIC EMBEDDING<|>concept<|>A user-specific embedding is a representation of a user that incorporates their preferences and interactions within item clusters.)\n(\"relationship\"<|>LOCALITY IMPLIES SIMILARITY<|>CLUSTERING ITEMS<|>The principle of locality implies similarity is foundational for the clustering of items based on their proximity in the embedding space<|>8)\n(\"relationship\"<|>CLUSTERING ITEMS<|>SPHERICAL K-MEANS<|>Spherical k-means is the method used to cluster items based on their similarities in the embedding space<|>7)\n(\"relationship\"<|>MIXTURE OF EMBEDDINGS<|>CLUSTERING ITEMS<|>The mixture of embeddings is derived from the clustering of items, representing user preferences over item clusters<|>8)\n(\"relationship\"<|>MAXIMUM LIKELIHOOD ESTIMATOR (MLE)<|>MIXTURE OF EMBEDDINGS<|>MLE is used to learn the distribution of user preferences within the clusters formed from the mixture of embeddings<|>7)\n(\"relationship\"<|>NEAREST NEIGHBOR SMOOTHING<|>USER-SPECIFIC EMBEDDING<|>Nearest neighbor smoothing enhances the user-specific embedding by incorporating information from similar users<|>6)\n(\"relationship\"<|>USER CENTROID<|>USER-SPECIFIC EMBEDDING<|>The user centroid is a component of the user-specific embedding, representing the user's preferences within a cluster<|>7)\n(\"relationship\"<|>JELINIK-MERCER SMOOTHING<|>MAXIMUM LIKELIHOOD ESTIMATOR (MLE)<|>Jelinik-Mercer smoothing is applied to the MLE distribution to reduce variance and improve the estimation of user preferences<|>5) \n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
