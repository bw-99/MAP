To illustrate the computational cost, we present the actual run-time on a machine with the environment Intel(R) Xeon(R) Gold 6132 CPU @ 2.60GHZ in TABLE 7. The results indicate that the time required for computing ORC is proportional to the size of the graph, and the cost for smaller graphs is correspondingly lower. Importantly, it is noteworthy that ORC only needs to be computed once prior to the training process, with the same computational complexity as HGCN [11] during both training and inference. To handle extremely large-scale graphs, approximation methods such as Sinkhorn [19] or Jaccard proxy [59] may be utilized. The efficacy of ùúÖHGCN and HGCN in learning representations for node classification is demonstrated through the visualization of their performance on the Disease and Cora datasets. To accomplish this, we employ the t-distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE) technique [77] to reduce the high-dimensional embeddings produced by the final layer of each model to a two-dimensional plane for visual examination. The results, shown in Figure 7, depict nodes as individual points, where each point is assigned a color that corresponds to its class. The visualization indicates that    </p><h2>publication_ref</h2> <p>['b17', 'b45', 'b10', 'b18', 'b58', 'b76'] </p><h2>figure_ref</h2> <p>['fig_5'] </p><h2>table_ref</h2> <p>['tab_8'] </p><h2>heading</h2> <p>C.2 Embedding Visualization </p><h2>text</h2> <p>= x ‚àà R ùëõ : ‚ü®x, x‚ü© 2 < -1 ùúÖ L ùëõ ùúÖ = x ‚àà R ùëõ+1 : ‚ü®x, x‚ü© L = 1 ùúÖ Metric ùëî BùúÖ x = ùúÜ ùúÖ </p><h2>publication_ref</h2> <p>[] </p><h2>figure_ref</h2> <p>[] </p><h2>table_ref</h2> <p>[] </p><h2>heading</h2> <p>C.3 Curvature-wise Performance </p><h2>text</h2> <p>The objective of the study is to perceive the local structure around nodes in tree-like graphs, encompassing local tree-like, zero-density, and densely connected structures. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, we conducted further analysis by classifying nodes into defined local substructures. As an example, consider the following, we set the nodes to the following three types: tree-like (ùúÖ ùëñ ‚â• -0.01); zero-like (-0.01 < ùúÖ ùëñ ‚â§ 0.01); positive-like (ùúÖ ùëñ > 0.01). The curvature of each node is defined as the sum of curvatures over its edges, that is:\nùúÖ ùëñ = 1 |ùëÅ ùëñ |\nùëó ‚ààùëÅ ùëñ ùúÖ ùëñ ùëó , where |ùëÅ ùëñ | is the number of neighbors of node ùëñ, and ùúÖ ùëñ ùëó is the curvature of the edge between nodes ùëñ and ùëó. This curvature measure was used to determine the local substructure of each node. In the following, we evaluated the performance of three models (GCN, HGCN, and the proposed method) on both the Cora and Airport datasets. Specifically, we calculated the accuracy/F1-score on the test set for nodes in each local substructure.\nThe results are shown in Table 8 and Table 9. The \"GT-Prop\" row in the Tables show the proportion of nodes belonging to each Overall, the study found that the models achieved comparable accuracy to the best achievable, but performance varied across different substructures. Specifically, Euclidean GCN outperformed HGCN on zero-density and densely connected areas, but underperformed on tree-like nodes. In contrast, HGCN showed improved accuracy for tree-like nodes, but lower accuracy on other substructures. The proposed model achieved a balance of performance across all substructures, with high accuracy for both tree-like and non-tree-like nodes. </p><h2>publication_ref</h2> <p>[] </p><h2>figure_ref</h2> <p>[] </p><h2>table_ref</h2> <p>['tab_9', 'tab_10'] </p><h2>heading</h2> <p>C.4 Connections of the Discrete\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}}
