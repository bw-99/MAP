Recalling also that K n ≥ 2, we get . We now obtain\nK 2 n P n -K n ∼ K 2 n P n ∼ p s .\nThen,\nK 2 n\nPn-Kn ≤ 2p s for all n sufficiently large. Hence, on the same range, we see from (101) that\nK 2 n P n -K n • e pn Kn •pen ≤ 2p s • e 3 4 pn ln n . (102\n)\nIn order to evaluate the R.H.S. of (102), we define\nF (n) = 2p s • e 3 4 pn ln n . (103\n)\nWith p n p s = p e ≤ 3 2 • ln n n for all n sufficiently large, we note that\np s ≤ 3 2 ln n np n . (104\n)\nNow, fix n large enough such that (102) and (104) hold. We consider the cases p n ≤ 1 ln n and p n > 1 ln n , separately. In the former case, we have F (n) ≤ 2p s e 3/4 immediately from (103). In the latter case we use the bound (104) to get\nF (n) ≤ 3 ln n np n e 3 4 pn ln n < 3 (ln n) 2 n • n 3/4\nupon noting that p n ≤ 1. Combining the two bounds, we have\nF (n) ≤ max 2p s e 3/4 , 3n -1/4 (ln n) 2 (105)\nfor all n sufficiently large. Letting n grow large and recalling that p s = o(1) we obtain lim n→∞ F (n) = 0. This establishes (99) in view of (102), and (95) follows from ( 98) and (100) for constant ℓ. From ( 94) and (95), we finally establish the desired conclusion (73). Note that (74) also follows since the extra condition p e n = Ω( 1) is used only once in obtaining (96) which holds trivially for ℓ = 0. The proof of Proposition 1.2 is thus completed.<h2>publication_ref</h2>[]<h2>figure_ref</h2>[]<h2>table_ref</h2>[]<h2>heading</h2>VIII. A PROOF OF PROPOSITION 2<h2>text</h2>Given (71) and Proposition 1.2 (property (a)), it is clear that Proposition 2 will follow if we show for each ℓ = 1, 2 . . . that\nP[D x,ℓ ∩ D y,ℓ ∩ E xy ] = o ℓ h=0 P A h ∩ K xy . (106)\nIn order to establish (106), we evaluate P[D x,ℓ ∩D y,ℓ ∩E xy ] proceeding similarly as in the proof of Proposition 1. To this end, we define the series of events B h in the following manner\nB h = (|N xy | = h) (|N xy | = ℓ -h -1) (|N xy | = ℓ -h -1) . (107\n)\nfor each h = 0, 1, . . . , ℓ -1. An analog of (64) follows immediately for any positive integer ℓ.\nD x,ℓ ∩ D y,ℓ ∩ E xy = ℓ-1 h=0 (B h ∩ E xy ) . (108\n)\nThe minus one term on ℓ is due to the fact that x and y are adjacent on event E xy ; there can be at most ℓ -1 nodes that are neighbors of both x and y on D x,ℓ ∩ D y,ℓ ∩ E xy . Given (108) and mutually exclusive events B h (h = 0, 1, . . . , ℓ -1), we obtain\nP[D x,ℓ ∩ D y,ℓ ∩ E xy ] = ℓ-1 h=0 P [B h ∩ E xy ] .(109)\nWe will establish Proposition 2 by obtaining the following result which evaluates the R.H.S. of (109). \nP [B h ∩ E xy ] = o ℓ h=0 P A h ∩ K xy . (110\n)\nIn order to see why Proposition 2 follows from Proposition 2.1, observe that (110) establishes (106) with the help of (109). As noted before, this establishes Proposition 2. \nP [B h ∩ E xy ] = P B h ∩ Kn u=1 Y u = Kn u=1 P [B h ∩ Y u ] .(111)\nGiven\nY u = [(|S xy | = u) ∩ C xy ],\nwe obtain\nP [B h ∩ Y u ] ≤ P [B h ∩ (|S xy | = u)] .(112)\nApplying ( 112) to (111), it follows that\nℓ-1 h=0 P [B h ∩ E xy ] ≤ ℓ-1 h=0 Kn u=1 P [B h ∩ (|S xy | = u)] = Kn u=1 P[|S xy | = u] • ℓ-1 h=\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}}
