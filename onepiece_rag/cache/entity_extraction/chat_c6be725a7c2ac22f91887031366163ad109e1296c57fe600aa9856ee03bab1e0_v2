The k-Pareto optimality po((x 1 , x 2 )) is the joint cumulative probability distribution function F (x 1 , x 2 ). Finally, the at least k-Pareto optimal elements are situated below the curve F (x 1 , x 2 ) = k.\nHaving choice between x with coordinates (x 1 , x 2 ) and y with coordinates (y 1 , y 2 ) means the rectangles ((0, 0), (x 1 , 0), x, (0, x 2 )) and ((0, 0), (y 1 , 0), y, (0, y 2 )) are not nested, as depicted in Fig. 4a.<h2>publication_ref</h2>[]<h2>figure_ref</h2>['fig_3', 'fig_3']<h2>table_ref</h2>[]<h2>heading</h2>Continuous Independent Variables<h2>text</h2>If X 1 and X 2 are continuous, then the function po can be considered to be a linear extension of R Ω . Indeed, if x and y are chosen independently and at random\nx y x 1 x 2 = 1 5 (0, 0) (1, 1) (a)\nx and y offer choice.\nx y from Ω, then P (po(x) = po(y)) = 0. On the other hand, it can be shown that div(Ω) = 1/2. This means that in half of the cases the relation R Ω cannot tell which element is preferable out of two elements extracted independently and at random from Ω.\nT max 2 5 (0, 0) (1, 1) (b) y is preferable to x.\nMoreover if X 1 and X 2 are independent, then the condition for uniqueness from Eq. ( 6) holds. In the special case where X 1 and X 2 are uniformly distributed on the interval [0, 1], the joint cumulative probability distribution function takes form of F (x 1 , x 2 ) = x 1 x 2 and the at least k-Pareto optimal elements are situated below a hyperbola x 1 x 2 = k. Combining this fact with Corollary 1 yields a surprising characterization of hyperbola, see Fig. 4 and the statement below.<h2>publication_ref</h2>[]<h2>figure_ref</h2>['fig_3']<h2>table_ref</h2>[]<h2>heading</h2>Characterization of Hyperbolas.<h2>text</h2>Out of all descending functions f from [0, 1] to [0, 1] delimiting an area 1 0 f (x)dx = c, the arc of hyperbola is the one offering the highest likelihood the rectangles ((0, 0), (x 1 , 0), x, (0, x 2 )) and ((0, 0), (y 1 , 0), y, (0, y 2 )) are not nested for two points x and y being drawn independently and at random from the delimited area.<h2>publication_ref</h2>[]<h2>figure_ref</h2>[]<h2>table_ref</h2>[]<h2>heading</h2>Independence on Marginal Distribution<h2>text</h2>Sklar's theorem [Sklar, 1959, Durante et al., 2013] states that the cumulative distribution function F (x 1 , x 2 ) can be represented as C(F 1 (x 1 ), F 2 (x 2 )) for a copula C. Marginas of X 1 and X 2 are fully described by the marginal cumulative probability distributions F 1 and F 2 , whereas the copula describes the dependence structure between X 1 and X 2 . The copula can be considered as a joint cumulative distribution function having two uniform marginal distributions on [0, 1]. Below we show that the introduced concepts do not depend on the marginal distribution of X 1 and X 2 .\nProposition 2. For a continuous random vector (X 1 , X 2 ) and the relation R Ω , k-Pareto optimality, choice, diversity and selections offering maximum choice only depend on the copula C of X 1 , X 2 .\nProof. Let us consider the mapping\nG : Ω → [0, 1] 2 , ω x → (F 1 (x 1 ), F 2 (x 2 )).\nWe consider R Ω and P defined on Ω. At the same time, on [0, 1] 2 we consider R defined by (x 1 , x 2 )R (y 1 , y 2 ) iff x 1 ≤ x 2 and y 1 ≤ y 2 ,\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}}
