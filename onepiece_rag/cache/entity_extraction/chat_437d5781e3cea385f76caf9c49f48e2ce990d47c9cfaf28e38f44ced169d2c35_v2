Many techniques aim to solve this issue by feature selection or embedding dimension search. However, these techniques typically select a fixed subset of features or embedding dimensions for all instances and feed all instances into one recommender model without considering heterogeneity between items or users. This paper proposes a novel instance-wise Hierarchical Architecture Search framework, iHAS, which automates neural architecture search at the instance level. Specifically, iHAS incorporates three stages: searching, clustering, and retraining. The searching stage identifies optimal instance-wise embedding dimensions across different field features via carefully designed Bernoulli gates with stochastic selection and regularizers. After obtaining these dimensions, the clustering stage divides samples into distinct groups via a deterministic selection approach of Bernoulli gates. The retraining stage then constructs different recommender models, each one designed with optimal dimensions for the corresponding group. We conduct extensive experiments to evaluate the proposed iHAS on two public benchmark datasets from a real-world recommender system. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of iHAS and its outstanding transferability to widely-used deep recommendation models.<h1>sections</h1><h2>heading</h2>INTRODUCTION<h2>text</h2>Recommender systems, which aim to predict the preference of users, have been widely deployed in various real-world scenarios, e.g., online advertising [3,27], social media [9], news apps [39], etc. Deep learning recommendation models (DLRMs) typically take a large amount of categorical (e.g., gender) or numerical (e.g., age) field features as input. These features are first encoded into highdimensional sparse one-hot vectors, which are later mapped into real-valued dense vectors via embedding tables. The recommender model then feeds these embeddings into a feature interaction layer which usually consists of deep neural network (DNN) [6] or factorization machine (FM) [8,14,26,34] to model user preferences for final prediction.\nThe embedding tables play a fundamental role in the recommendation system, as they dominate the majority of parameters. However, most existing methods construct their proposed recommender models with large-sized embedding tables and a uniform dimension size for all possible fields [8,10,29], which may lead to overfitting, high computational cost, and poor model generalization [15,25,33]. Therefore, the first objective for an optimal DLRM is to find optimal embedding dimensions for different fields and remove redundant dimensions. Performing embedding dimension search is also sufficient to include feature selection, i.e., the optimal dimension for a field feature could be zero, which means completely excluding this feature.\nA common approach for embedding dimension search is to employ the l 0 norm on the dimensions to penalize the count of nonzero dimension entries. However, as the l 0 norm poses a computational challenge for gradient descent, researchers have attempted to substitute l 0 with a surrogate function, such as the l 1 norm for LASSO [32], yet achieving limited selection ability [35]. Recently, probabilistic approaches [18,33] suggest utilizing Bernoulli random variables (RVs) with Gumbel-Softmax approximations to identify the top 𝐾 features with the highest probabilities. Though these methods can be applied for dimension selection, we have empirically observed that the probabilities learned are often indistinguishable. Therefore, selecting the top 𝐾 features/dimensions based on these probabilities may inadvertently result in either the exclusion of critical features/dimensions or the inclusion of irrelevant ones.\nFurthermore, prior approaches uniformly apply embedding dimension selection across all instances in the datasets, therefore disregarding the inherent variations between individual samples. This one-size-for-all approach can be inadequate in many scenarios, especially when dealing with highly heterogeneous populations where relevant features can significantly diverge across users or across items. For example, in a movie recommendation system, the feature \"age\" usually plays a crucial role in recommending Disney movies, thereby possibly necessitating a larger embedding dimension. Conversely, \"age\" is less relevant for comedy films, resulting in a smaller dimension size. Thus, it is evident that treating all instances identically may overlook these context-specific nuances. Intuitively speaking, when dimension selection is performed at the instance level, we can create neural architectures that are better suited to individual samples.
