As recently thoroughly studied by Liu et al. [48], an APR tool should not be expected to fix a bug that current fault localization systems fail to localize. Nevertheless, with iFixR, we must demonstrate that our fine-grained IRFL offers comparable performance with SBFL tools used in the APR literature.\nTable 5 provides performance measurements on the localization of bugs. SBFL is performed based on two different versions of the GZoltar testing framework, but always based on the Ochiai ranking metric. Finally, because fault localization tools output a ranked list of suspicious statements, results are provided in terms of whether the correct location is placed under the top-k suspected statements. In this work, following the practice in the literature [48,56], we consider that a bug is localized if any buggy statement is localized. Overall, the results show that our IRFL implementation is strictly comparable to the common implementation of spectrum-based fault localization when applied on the Defects4J bug dataset. Note that the comparison is conducted for 171 bugs of Math and Lang, given that these are the projects for which the bug linking can be reliably performed for applying the IRFL. Although performance results are similar, we remind the reader that SBFL is applied by considering future test cases. To highlight a practical interest of IRFL, we compute for each bug localizable in the top-10, the elapsed time between the bug report date and the date the relevant test case is submitted for this bug. Based on the distribution shown in Figure 6, on mean average, IRFL could reduce this time by 26 days. Finally, to stress the importance of future test cases for spectrumbased fault localization, we consider all Defects4J bugs and compute localization performance with and without future test cases.\nResults listed in Table 6 confirms that in most bug cases, the localization is impossible: Only 10 bugs (out of 395) can be localized among the top-10 suspicious statements of SBFL at the time the bug is reported. In comparison, our IRFL locates 72 bugs under the same conditions of having no relevant test cases to trigger the bugs. Fine-grained IR-based fault localization in iFixR is as accurate as Spectrum-based fault localization in localizing Defects4J bugs. Additionally, it does not have the constraint of requiring test cases that may not be available when the bug is reported.<h2>publication_ref</h2>['b47', 'b47', 'b55']<h2>figure_ref</h2>['fig_6']<h2>table_ref</h2>['tab_8', 'tab_9']<h2>heading</h2>RQ2: [Overfitting]<h2>text</h2>Patch generation attempts to mutate suspected buggy code with suitable fix patterns. Aside from having adequate patterns or not (which is out of the scope of our study), a common challenge of APR lies in the effective selection of buggy statements. In typical test-based APR, test cases drive the selection of these statements. The incompleteness of test suites is however currently suspected to often lead to overfitting of generated patches [94].\nWe perform patch generation experiments to investigate the impact of localization bias. We compare our IRFL implementation against commonly-used SBFL implementations in the literature of test-based APR. We recall that the patch validation step in these experiments makes no assumptions about future test cases (i.e., all test cases are leveraged as in classical APR pipeline). For each bug, depending on the rank of the buggy statements in the suspicious statements yielded the fault localization system (either IRFL or SBFL), the patch generation can produce more or less relevant patches. Table 7 details the repair performance in relation to the position of buggy statements in the output of fault localization. Results are provided in terms of numbers of plausible and correct [69] patches that can be found by considering top-k statements returned by the fault localizer. x is the number of bugs for which a correct patch is generated; y is the number of bugs for which a plausible patch is generated.\nOverall, we find that IRFL and SBFL localization information lead to similar repair performance in terms of the number of fixed bugs plausibly/correctly. Actually IRFL-supported APR outperforms SBFL-supported APR on the Lang project bugs and vice-versa for Math project bugs: overall, 6 bugs that are fixed using IRFL output, cannot be fixed using SBFL output (although assuming the availability of the bug triggering test cases to run the SBFL tool).\nWe investigate the cases of plausible patches in both localization scenarios to characterize the reasons why these patches appear to only be overfitting the test suites. Table 8 details the overfitting reasons for the two scenarios.
