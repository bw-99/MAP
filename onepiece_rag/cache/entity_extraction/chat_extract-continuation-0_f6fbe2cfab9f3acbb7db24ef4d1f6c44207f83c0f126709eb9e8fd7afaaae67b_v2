Instead, we collected their verbal feedback on the pros and cons of each design. </p><h2>publication_ref</h2> <p>[] </p><h2>figure_ref</h2> <p>[] </p><h2>table_ref</h2> <p>[] </p><h2>heading</h2> <p>Result and Analysis </p><h2>text</h2> <p>We compute the accuracy of each user's response to a question by comparing them with top-2 answers. The overall accuracy is measured by the number of correct answers to each question. In Figure 4, we depict the accuracy and completion time of four groups of seven questions. Because both accuracy and time do not follow normal distributions, we apply the Mann-Whitney test to analyze.\nOn task accuracy (Figure 4(a)), the result reveals that, for factor selection by contribution (Q1/Q2), by stability (Q3), and stock selection by factor contribution (Q6/Q7), the accuracy of iQUANT is significantly higher than the baseline design: U = 324.0, p = .024 for Q1/Q2; U = 30.0, p = .001 for Q3; U = 207.0, p < .001 for Q6/Q7. The average task accuracies are 1.14±0.14 (iQUANT) and 0.96±0.07 (baseline) for Q1/Q2; 1.29±0.27 (iQUANT) and 0.43±0.3 (baseline) for Q3; 1.36±0.19 (iQUANT) and 0.82±0.15 (baseline) for Q6/Q7. For factor selection in a sector (Q4/Q5), the accuracy difference between the iQUANT and baseline is not significant (U = 364.0, p = .15), though the average accuracy of iQUANT (1.0±0.0) is higher than the baseline (0.93±0.1).\nOn task completion time (Figure 4(b)), the result reveals that, for factor selection by stability (Q3), the completion time using iQUANT is significantly shorter than the baseline design (U = 30.5, p = .002). The average completion times are 27.2s±3.8s (iQUANT) and 50.9s±12.8s (baseline). For factor selection by contribution (Q1/Q2), in a sector of stocks (Q4/Q5), and stock selection by factor contribution (Q6/Q7), the completion time using iQUANT is not significantly shorter than the baseline design: U = 359.0, p = .58 for Q1/Q2; U = 367.0, p = .68 for Q4/Q5; U = 342.0, p = .41 for Q6/Q7. The average completion times are 17.1s±3.4s (iQUANT) and 16.2±3.6s (baseline) for Q1/Q2; 15.9s±3.4s (iQUANT) and 15.9s±4.5s (baseline) for Q4/Q5; 20.4s±3.6s (iQUANT) and 29.3s±9.0s (baseline) for Q6/Q7.\nThe study result indicates that, on most tasks, iQUANT leads to higher task accuracy than the baseline design. The only exception happens on the factor selection task for a sector of stocks (Q4/Q5). It is found that in the stock data used for these two questions, the factor having the highest positive/negative contribution is quite separated from all the other factors. Hence, only the top-1 factor is used as the correct answer, and in both designs, subjects could easily identify this factor (a 100% accuracy for iQUANT). For similarly easy tasks (Q1/Q2 and Q6/Q7), though the baseline design in most case helps to identify one (but only one) top factor, the accuracy of iQUANT is significantly higher because subjects could quickly discover more top factors in comparison to the baseline design. For the hard task of selecting factors by stability (Q3), the advantage of iQUANT in accuracy becomes the highest. Meanwhile, on completion time, iQUANT is favored only in the hard task of Q3, for which the iQUANT design can better support temporal comparison and analytics of factor contribution. For the other tasks, the completion time is similar in both iQUANT and baseline design. </p><h2>publication_ref</h2> <p>[] </p><h2>figure_ref</h2> <p>['fig_5', 'fig_5', 'fig_5'] </p><h2>table_ref</h2> <p>[] </p><h2>heading</h2> <p>Expert Feedback </p><h2>text</h2> <p>In the user experiment, experts also provided valuable feedback about several aspects of iQUANT . On positive aspects, some experts stressed that iQUANT presented an effective way to visually compare salient factors among different sectors of the market. In practice, the factor constituent and dynamics are truly different across sectors, which is of great importance to factor investing. As supported by the study result, experts also found iQUANT to be useful in analyzing the temporal dimension of factors, as well as the relationship between factors and stocks, which are exactly our design goal.
