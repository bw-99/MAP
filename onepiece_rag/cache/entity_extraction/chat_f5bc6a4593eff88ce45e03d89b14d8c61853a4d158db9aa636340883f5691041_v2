THE RESULTS </p><h2>text</h2> <p>For a random key graph G(n, X n , Y n ), Theorem 1 and Corollary 1 below present the asymptotically exact probabilities for k-connectivity and the property of the minimum degree being at least k, where k is a positive integer and does not scale with n. The term ln stands for the natural logarithm function, and e is its base. We use the standard asymptotic notation O(•), o(•), Ω(•), ω(•), Θ(•), ∼; in particular, for two positive sequences x n and y n , the relation x n ∼ y n means lim n→∞ (x n /y n ) = 1. All asymptotic statements are understood with n → ∞. Also, P[E] denotes the probability that event E occurs.\nTheorem 1. For a random key graph G(n, X n , Y n ), let q n be the probability that there exists an edge between two nodes. With a sequence α n defined by\nq n = ln n + (k -1) ln ln n + α n n ,(1)\nthen under X n ≥ 2, it follows that\nlim n→∞ P G(n, X n , Y n ) is k-connected. = lim n→∞ P [ G(n, X n , Y n ) has a minimum degree at least k. ] =      0, if lim n→∞ α n = -∞, 1, if lim n→∞ α n = ∞, e -e -α * (k-1)! , if lim n→∞ α n = α * ∈ (-∞, ∞).(2)\nWe have the following corollary by replacing the condition (1) on the edge probability q n with a condition on the asymptotics Xn 2  Yn of q n (formally, q n ∼ Xn \nY n = ln n + (k -1) ln ln n + β n n ,(3)\nthen under X n ≥ 2, it follows that\nlim n→∞ P G(n, X n , Y n ) is k-connected. = lim n→∞ P [ G(n, X n , Y n ) has a minimum degree at least k. ] =      0, if lim n→∞ β n = -∞, 1, if lim n→∞ β n = ∞, e -e -β * (k-1)! , if lim n→∞ β n = β * ∈ (-∞, ∞).\nRemark 1. From Lemma 4 (resp., Lemma 5) in the Appendix, we can introduce an extra condition α n = ±O(ln ln n) = ±o(ln n) (resp., β n = ±O(ln ln n) = ±o(ln n)) in proving Theorem 1 (resp., Corollary 1). </p><h2>publication_ref</h2> <p>[] </p><h2>figure_ref</h2> <p>[] </p><h2>table_ref</h2> <p>[] </p><h2>heading</h2> <p>Remark 2. </p><h2>text</h2> <p>In Theorem 1 and Corollary 1, since the results are in the asymptotic sense, the conditions only need to hold for all n sufficiently large.\nEstablishing Corollary 1 given Theorem 1 is straightforward and is given in the Appendix. Below we explain how to obtain Theorem 1. Since a necessary condition for a graph to be kconnected is that the minimum degree is at least k, the proof of Theorem 1 will be completed once we have the following two lemmas. Lemma 1 is from our prior work [12]. Lemma 2 simply reproduces the result on the minimum degree in Theorem 1. </p><h2>publication_ref</h2> <p>['b11'] </p><h2>figure_ref</h2> <p>[] </p><h2>table_ref</h2> <p>[] </p><h2>heading</h2> <p>Lemma 1 (Our work [12, Lemma 5]).
