Although they can be used by developers to keep track of the bugs that they encounter and the features to be implemented, issue tracking systems allow for user participation as a communication channel for collecting feedback on software executions in production. Table 3 illustrates a typical bug report when a user of the LANG library code has encountered an issue while using the NumberUtils API. A description of erroneous behavior is provided. Occasionally, the user may include in the bug description some information on how to reproduce the bug. Oftentimes, users simply insert code snippets or dump the execution stack traces.\nIn this study, among our dataset of 162 bug reports, we note that only 27 (i.e., ∼17%) are reported by users who are also developersfoot_0 contributing to the projects. 15 (i.e., ∼9%) bugs are reported and again fixed by the same project contributors. These percentages suggest that, for the majority of cases, the bug reports are indeed genuinely submitted by users of the software who require project developers' attention. </p><h2>publication_ref</h2> <p>[] </p><h2>figure_ref</h2> <p>[] </p><h2>table_ref</h2> <p>[] </p><h2>heading</h2> <p>Table 3: Example bug report (Defects4J Lang-7). </p><h2>text</h2> <p>Issue No. </p><h2>publication_ref</h2> <p>[] </p><h2>figure_ref</h2> <p>[] </p><h2>table_ref</h2> <p>[] </p><h2>heading</h2> <p>LANG-822 Summary </p><h2>text</h2> <p>NumberUtils#createNumber -bad behaviour for leading \"-\" Description NumberUtils#createNumber checks for a leading \"-\" in the string, and returns null if found. This is documented as a work round for a bug in BigDecimal.\nReturning nulll is contrary to the Javadoc and the behaviour for other methods which would throw NumberFormatException. It's not clear whether the BigDecimal problem still exists with recent versions of Java. However, if it does exist, then the check needs to be done for all invocations of BigDecimal, i.e. needs to be moved to createBigDecimal.\nGiven the buggy program version and a bug report, iFixR must unfold the workflow for precisely identifying (at the statement level) the buggy code locations. We remind the reader that, in this step, future test cases cannot be relied upon. We consider that if such test cases could have triggered the bug, a continuous integration system would have helped developers deal with the bug before the software is shipped towards users. </p><h2>publication_ref</h2> <p>[] </p><h2>figure_ref</h2> <p>[] </p><h2>table_ref</h2> <p>[] </p><h2>heading</h2> <p>Fault Localization w/o Test Cases </p><h2>text</h2> <p>To identify buggy code locations within the source code of a program, we resort to Information Retrieval (IR)-based fault localization (IRFL) [67,80]. The general objective is to leverage potential similarity between the terms used in a bug report and the source code to identify relevant buggy code locations. The literature includes a large body of work on IRFL [57,72,81,85,87,96,99] where researchers systematically extract tokens from a given bug report to formulate a query to be matched in a search space of documents formed by the collections of source code files and indexed through tokens extracted from source code. IRFL approaches then rank the documents based on a probability of relevance (often measured as a similarity score). Highly ranked files are predicted to be the ones that are likely to contain the buggy code.\nDespite recurring interest in the literature, with numerous approaches continuously claiming new performance improvements over the state-of-the-art, we are not aware of any adoption in program repair research or practice. We postulate that one of the reasons is that IRFL techniques have so far focused on file-level localization, which is too coarse-grained (in comparison to spectrumbased fault localization output). Recently, Locus [85] and BLIA [96] are state-of-the-art techniques which narrow down localization, respectively to the code change or the method level. Nevertheless, to the best of our knowledge, no IRFL technique has been proposed in the literature for statement-level localization.\nIn this work, we develop an algorithm to rank suspicious statements based on the output (i.e., files) of a state-of-the-art IRFL tool, thus yielding a fine-grained IR-based fault localizer which will then be readily integrated into a concrete patch generation pipeline. </p><h2>publication_ref</h2> <p>['b66', 'b79', 'b56', 'b71', 'b80', 'b84', 'b86', 'b95', 'b98', 'b84', 'b95'] </p><h2>figure_ref</h2> <p>[] </p><h2>table_ref</h2> <p>[] </p><h2>heading</h2> <p>Ranking Suspicious Files. </p><h2>text</h2> <p>We leverage an existing IRFL tool.
