DNNs are employed to generate the embedding vector representing the user behavior or predicting user-item pair scores. The models take advantage of both continuous (dense) and categorical (sparse) features.\nDense features can be directly processed by a DNN while sparse features are captured by large ETs with sparse lookup and pooling operations. These ET operations (lookups, NNS) contribute a significant portion of the run time in RecSys as shown in the operation breakdown of the MovieLens dataset using the YouTubeDNN RecSys [2] in Fig. 2.\nExisting efforts on accelerating RecSys include field programmable gate array (FPGA)-based accelerators. E.g., Flee-tRec [12] and MicroRec [13] alleviate the memory-bandwidth bottleneck of the ETs in RecSys by using FPGAs with high bandwidth memory. Near-memory computing has also been considered to alleviate the memory bottleneck. RecNMP [4] uses a dual in-line memory module-based near-memory computing that can support sparse embedding models. Most of these existing hardware accelerators only focus on a single aspect of RecSys, i.e., ranking, filtering, DNNs or ETs. Though it is possible to simply cascade these accelerators to implement RecSys, such a simple-minded approach results in higher hardware cost due to duplicated components.<h2>publication_ref</h2>['b1', 'b9', 'b1', 'b11', 'b12', 'b3']<h2>figure_ref</h2>['fig_0', 'fig_0', 'fig_0', 'fig_0', 'fig_0', 'fig_1']<h2>table_ref</h2>[]<h2>heading</h2>B. In-Memory Computing Circuits<h2>text</h2>IMC circuits can alleviate the memory bottleneck and provide parallelism to RecSys operations. This section discusses different types of IMC circuits such as TCAMs, crossbars, GPCiMs and CMA.\nTCAMs enable parallel searches based on the Hamming distance for a query against a large stored database in O(1) time [5]. Using the threshold-match mode of the TCAMs, we can retrieve the row entries in the array nearest to the query under the threshold distance by parallel searches. In a TCAM array with r rows and c columns, the TCAM cells in a row are serially connected through a common matchline. Each TCAM cell, s ij , performs an XOR operation between bit j of query Q and the bit j stored at s ij . Each matchline implements a logic AND of all the cells connected to it.\nCrossbars are an IMC structure where every input is connected to every output through cross-points that consist of memory elements and selectors. Crossbars can efficiently implement matrix-vector multiplications, and are thus ideal accelerators for DNN models such as convolutional neural networks [14].\nGPCiMs [7], [15] perform general-purpose Boolean logic and arithmetic operations inside RAM. GPCiMs can employ specialized memory cells based on emerging technologies to perform current-based operations inside a memory array (e.g., [7]). Alternatively, customized memory peripherals (such as sense amplifiers) can be designed to operate with two memory words that are simultaneously selected by row decoders. In GPCiMs that employ customized sensed amplifiers, the voltage (or current flow) through a column-connected bitline is sensed and compared to one (or multiple) reference(s) so the results of Boolean logic/arithmetic can be produced.\nCMAs [8], [9], [15] combine multiple IMC functionalities in the same physical structure. For instance, CMAs can work as either TCAM or GPCiM units at distinct times. Note that conventional TCAMs perform row-wise sensing as matchlines are placed along the row direction. GPCiMs, on the other hand, require the voltage drop (or current flow) through the vertically-connected bitlines to be sensed and compared to one (or more) reference(s) in order to produce the results needed for general-purpose computation. Due to this difference in the TCAM and GPCiM arrays, combining them in a single hardware structure requires additional memory peripherals to achieve re-configurability [8], [9].\nStoring RecSys ETs requires significant amount of memory and substantial communication between memory and processing units, which could be alleviated by IMC architectures. The use of CMAs based on emerging technologies can be beneficial for implementing IMC-based RecSys compared to standard CMOS CMAs [15] due to the increased density of memory cells and lower standby power (a result of the device's non-volatility).\nFeFETs have been used in various IMC based circuits such as CAMs, GPCiMs and CMAs [16], [17]. Previous work has demonstrated the benefits of FeFET-based CMAs over other emerging technologies such as ReRAMs [8], [9]. FeFETs have similar structure as metal-oxide-semiconductor fieldeffect transistors (MOSFETs) used in standard CMOS silicon, except a layer of FE oxide is deposited in the transistor's gate stack. Because of this, FeFETs are compatible with the CMOS fabrication process [10] and large-scale FeFET memories have been demonstrated [10]. For these reasons, we employ a FeFET-based CMA design for accelerating RecSys.<h2>publication_ref</h2>['b4', 'b13', 'b6', 'b14', 'b6', 'b7', 'b8', 'b14', 'b7', 'b8', 'b14',\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}}
