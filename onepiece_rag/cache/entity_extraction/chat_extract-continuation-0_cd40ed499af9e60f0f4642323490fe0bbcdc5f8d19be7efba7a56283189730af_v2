On the other hand, our designs are tailored to the target users. For example in the factor view, green/red are used to indicate the decline/rise of stock prices, according to the convention of our target market. The effectiveness of iQUANT design is confirmed by the user study result and expert feedback. Most subjects found iQUANT easy to learn and understand.\nThe user study and its design choices. We evaluated iQUANT through a formal user study focusing on the performance of factor/stock selection. The study would have accounted for more stages of iQUANT by looking at the final stock returns, or the accuracy in predicting. We stayed in the scope of evaluating factors for two reasons. First, the stock return by an interactive factor investing system is determined in complex interactions among factor/stock selection, predictive model, and trading strategy. A higher stock return in the study may or may not be directly correlated with a better factor selection design. Second, there is currently no com-mercial tool that supports end-to-end interactive factor investing. We compare iQUANT with a baseline design, which is not natively integrated with prediction models and trading strategies.\nThe deployment of iQUANT and its extensibility. The investment industry is highly closed as the winning secret can be too valuable to disclose. This closedness prohibits a more practical approach to directly optimize deployed tools. Instead, we developed a homegrown interactive factor investing pipeline and an end-to-end system. Because of the complexity of quantitative investment, we mainly focus on improving the factor selection in the pipeline. We demonstrated the effectiveness of iQUANT by using the 20-year real stock market data. However, our system can also be deployed to take in real-time data. As a next step, we plan to customize and integrate iQUANT into the production system of our industrial collaborators, in the hope of making real impacts on the industry. </p><h2>publication_ref</h2> <p>[] </p><h2>figure_ref</h2> <p>['fig_2'] </p><h2>table_ref</h2> <p>[] </p><h2>heading</h2> <p>Conclusion </p><h2>text</h2> <p>This paper presents iQUANT, a visual analytics system that seamlessly integrates algorithmic and user-steered feature selection methods for interactive factor investing. On the analytics side, we explore the use of sparse regression models that jointly optimizing factor selection and stock prediction processes. On the visualization side, we propose multiple coordinated visual designs to comprehensively illustrate importance metrics of each factor, including its positive/negative contribution to models, the factor stability and sensitivity. On top of the prediction model and visualization design, iQUANT develops an interactive framework that encloses factor refinement and portfolio construction in the same visual analytics loop. With iQUANT , traders can optimize their investment strategy and evaluate them in industry-standard backtesting. We demonstrate the value of iQUANT through one formal user study and two case studies, using a real stock market dataset recording the stock data in the past 30 years. On the selection of investment time and stock portfolio, our domain experts achieved excess returns from both individual stock and sector-based portfolios. </p><h2>publication_ref</h2> <p>[] </p><h2>figure_ref</h2> <p>[] </p><h2>table_ref</h2> <p>[] </p>\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>IQUANT<|>concept<|>iQUANT is a visual analytics system designed for interactive factor investing, integrating algorithmic and user-steered feature selection methods to optimize investment strategies and evaluate them through backtesting.)\n(\"entity\"<|>USER STUDY<|>concept<|>The user study evaluates the performance of iQUANT in factor and stock selection, assessing its effectiveness based on user feedback and study results.)\n(\"entity\"<|>FACTOR SELECTION<|>concept<|>Factor selection is a process in investment strategies that involves choosing specific factors that influence stock performance, which is a key focus of iQUANT.)\n(\"entity\"<|>STOCK PRICES<|>concept<|>Stock prices represent the value of shares in a company, which are indicated by colors (green/red) in iQUANT to show price changes.)\n(\"entity\"<|>PREDICTIVE MODEL<|>concept<|>A predictive model is a mathematical model used to forecast future stock returns based on historical data and selected factors.)\n(\"entity\"<|>TRADING STRATEGY<|>concept<|>A trading strategy is a plan designed to achieve a profitable return on investment, which can be influenced by factor selection and predictive models.)\n(\"entity\"<|>VISUALIZATION DESIGN<|>concept<|>Visualization design in iQUANT refers to the coordinated visual elements that illustrate the importance metrics of each factor, including their contributions to models.)\n(\"entity\"<|>SPARSE REGRESSION MODELS<|>concept<|>Sparse regression models are statistical methods used in iQUANT to optimize factor selection and stock prediction processes.)\n(\"entity\"<|>REAL STOCK MARKET DATA<|>concept<|>Real stock market data refers to historical stock data used to evaluate the effectiveness of iQUANT over a 20-year period.)\n(\"entity\"<|>EXCESS RETURNS<|>concept<|>Excess returns are the returns achieved above a benchmark, which domain experts obtained from using iQUANT for stock and sector-based portfolios.)\n(\"relationship\"<|>IQUANT<|>USER STUDY<|>The user study evaluates the effectiveness of iQUANT in factor and stock selection based on user feedback<|>8)\n(\"relationship\"<|>IQUANT<|>FACTOR SELECTION<|>iQUANT focuses on improving factor selection as part of its interactive investment strategy<|>9)\n(\"relationship\"<|>FACTOR SELECTION<|>PREDICTIVE MODEL<|>Factor selection is integral to the development of predictive models in investment strategies<|>7)\n(\"relationship\"<|>IQUANT<|>VISUALIZATION DESIGN<|>iQUANT employs visualization design to illustrate the importance of each factor in the investment process<|>8)\n(\"relationship\"<|>SPARSE REGRESSION MODELS<|>FACTOR SELECTION<|>Sparse regression models are used in iQUANT to optimize the factor selection process<|>6)\n(\"relationship\"<|>REAL STOCK MARKET DATA<|>IQUANT<|>Real stock market data is utilized to demonstrate the effectiveness of iQUANT over a significant historical period<|>7)\n(\"relationship\"<|>EXCESS RETURNS<|>IQUANT<|>Domain experts achieved excess returns by applying iQUANT to their investment strategies<|>8)\n(\"relationship\"<|>TRADING STRATEGY<|>FACTOR SELECTION<|>The trading strategy is influenced by the selected factors in the investment process<|>6) \n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
