Fixed dimension embedding (FDE) specifies a uniform dimension size for all fields via traversal search and is paired with all feature selection methods to test the effectiveness of feature selection alone. FTRL [50] is a widely used feature selection algorithm that incorporates L1 and L2 regularization and has excellent sparsity and convergence properties. AutoField [37] is an AutoML framework that can adaptively evaluate the inclusion/exclusion probability for each feature. Following the experimental setup in the original paper, we evaluated model performance by keeping varying numbers of features and identified the configuration that achieved the best performance. AdaFS [38] employs a control network to score input data samples and adaptively select the most informative features. Mirroring AdaFS-hard [38] in the original study, we performed hard feature selection to retain different proportions of features in order of importance and discarded the remainder. AutoFIS [36] is a state-of-theart method to select important feature interactions in FMbased methods 5 . Notice that we tried different deletion ratios ranging from 0 to 1 with an interval of 0.1, and only presented the best results with the highest AUC metric. The feature selection performance of i-Razor is evaluated by just removing the fields dominated by dimension 0. 2) Dimension search methods. AutoDim [19] and DARTS [17] are two state-of-the-art methods that bear the closest resemblance to i-Razor and can automatically select appropriate dimensions for different fields. Both methods perform dimension search directly on all fields without feature selection to evaluate the validity of naive dimension optimization. Unlike AutoDim [19] and i-Razor, different dimension candidates in DARTS [17] do not share dimension blocks with each other. DARTS needs to allocate total K j=1 D j dimensions to each field in the pretraining model and relies on the argmax operator as Autodim for dimension selection.\n3) Hybrid methods. In addition to our approach, we compare the training mechanism of feature selection followed by dimension search, and the corresponding baselines are designated as 'AutoFIS w/ AutoDim' and 'AutoFIS w/ i-Razor'. </p><h2>publication_ref</h2> <p>['b49', 'b36', 'b37', 'b37', 'b35', 'b18', 'b16', 'b18', 'b16'] </p><h2>figure_ref</h2> <p>[] </p><h2>table_ref</h2> <p>[] </p><h2>heading</h2> <p>Evaluation Metrics </p><h2>text</h2> <p>We evaluate the performance of our proposed method on the classical CTR prediction task. The evaluation metrics include Area Under the ROC Curve (AUC), the number of selected fields (Fields), the total embedding dimensions used in the retraining stage (Dims), and the parameter quantity of all embeddings (Params) 6 . A higher AUC indicates a better recommendation performance. It is noteworthy that a slightly higher AUC at 0.001-level is regarded as significant for the CTR prediction task [19], [51]. We naturally introduce Dims and Fields as straightforward metrics since all methods aim to reduce model parameters through feature selection or dimension search. </p><h2>publication_ref</h2> <p>['b18', 'b50'] </p><h2>figure_ref</h2> <p>[] </p><h2>table_ref</h2> <p>[] </p><h2>heading</h2> <p>Implementation </p><h2>text</h2> <p>We implement all algorithms in Tensorflow [52] and use the Adagrad [53] optimizer for gradient descent. For a fair comparison, for each baseline, we have reproduced it with reference to the original paper. Table 2 summarizes the key parameters used in our experiments. For AutoDim, we adopt the same annealing temperature τ = max(0.01, 1 -0.00005 • t) provided in the original paper [19]. The code is publicly available on https://github.com/YaoYao1995/i-Razor.git.\n6.
