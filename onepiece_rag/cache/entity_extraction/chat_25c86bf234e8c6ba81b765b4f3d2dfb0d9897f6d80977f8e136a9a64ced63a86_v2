Definition 3. For any measurable set A, the diversity of A is the ratio div(A) = cho(A)/µ(A) 2 .\nThus div(A) is the likelihood that there is choice between the two randomly chosen elements. The main ingredient of our solution to the maximum choice problem is the following concept. Definition 4. The k-Pareto optimality of an element x ∈ X is the measure of the subset of X containing all elements strictly preferable to x:\npo(x) = µ({y|yR * x}).\nIf µ is the probability measure, the k-Pareto optimality of an element x, po(x), is the likelihood an element drawn at random from X is strictly preferable to x.\nFinally, we introduce the sets of at least k-Pareto optimal elements. Such sets consist of all elements in X with po ≤ k. In Section 3 we show that this concept yields a solution for the maximum choice problem. Definition 5. The at least k-Pareto optimal elements T k form the measurable set defined as follows:\nT k = {x ∈ X| po(x) ≤ k} 8 . </p><h2>publication_ref</h2> <p>[] </p><h2>figure_ref</h2> <p>[] </p><h2>table_ref</h2> <p>[] </p><h2>heading</h2> <p>Example </p><h2>text</h2> <p>In this subsection, we discuss an illustrative example to demonstrate the concepts defined in Sections 2.1 and 2.2. Let us consider a finite subset X of R 2 , counting measure µ, and the relation R defined as follows:\n(x 1 , x 2 )R (y 1 , y 2 ) iff x 1 ≤ y 1 and x 2 ≤ y 2 , see Fig. 1.\nIn economics, x is Pareto optimal if there is no y in X such that xR * y. In our language, this means that po(x) = 0. Thus, k-Pareto optimality indicates how much an element is away from being Pareto optimal.\nLet X be comprised of six points presented in Fig. 2. As we are considering the counting measure, µ(X) = 6.  Sorting the set X by k-Pareto optimality of its elements will produce the following result: ({A, B, C}, {E}, {D, F }). This sorting is different from sorting by Pareto fronts. The latter approach is widely used in practice and is the basis of all Pareto dominance-based genetic optimization algorithms [Li et al., 2015]. Sorting by Pareto fronts is done in the following way. First, the first Pareto front, which is the set of non-dominated points, is identified. Next, the points from this front are removed from the consideration and the process is repeated until all points are assigned to a front. Sorting the points from Fig. 2 \nk that µ(T k ) = m.\nWe prove the above stated theorem in several steps. First, we show that for selections the computation of choice can be simplified. It only requires to compute a simple integral instead of a double integral.\nIntegral Formula. If S is a measurable selection and µ(S) < +∞, then\ncho(S) = S (µ(S) -2 po(x))dµ(x).(1)\nProof. The fact that set S is a selection means that ∀y ∈ S : {x ∈ S|xR * y} = {x ∈ X|xR * y}. That is, any element x from X strictly preferable to any element y in S, also belong to S (x ∈ S). Using the definition of choice from Def. 2 and µ(S) < +∞ we obtain\ncho(S) = µ(S) 2 -2(µ × µ)({(x, y) ∈ S 2 |xR * y}) = µ(S) 2 -2(µ × µ)({(x, y) ∈ S × X|yR * x}).\nFubini's theorem [Halmos, 2013] indicates that\n(µ×µ)({(x, y) ∈ S × X|yR * x} = = S X 1 R * d(µ(y)) dµ(x) = S po(x)dµ(x),\nwhere 1 R * is the characteristic function of R *foot_5 .\nFinally, the integral formula results from the fact that µ(S) 2 -2 S po(x)dµ(x) = S (µ(S) -2 po(x))dµ(x).\nLet's now consider the function c defined on Σ for any A of finite measure by\nc(A) = A (µ(A) -2 po(x))dµ(x).\nThe integral formula defined in Eq. ( 1) means that for any selection S, we have c(S) = cho(S). The second step of our proof of Theorem 1 is to show that T k is the largest measurable set that maximizes c for its respective measure. More precisely, we will prove the following lemma. Lemma 1. For any k such as µ(T k ) < +∞ we have\nc(T k ) = max A∈Σ,µ(A)≤µ(T k ) c(A). Moreover, if µ(A) ≤ µ(T k ) and c(A) = c(T k ), then A ⊆ T k almost-everywhere.\nThe context of this lemma is very similar to the knapsack problem [\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}}
