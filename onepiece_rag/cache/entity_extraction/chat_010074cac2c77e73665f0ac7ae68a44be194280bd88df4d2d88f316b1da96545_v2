(19)\nThe partial derivative of the nodes in Equation ( 19) is zero if they are not on the path between node 𝑢 and 𝑣, and then the feature influence can be decomposed into the sum influence of all related paths.

For more generality, we use constant 𝐶 to denote the 𝑛. The condition for equality is if and only if 𝑑 * 𝑔 = 1 and the 𝑣 is the unique neighbor of node 𝑢, i.e., 𝛾 = 1 and 𝐶 = 1. □ Theorem 4.3 shows that the node influence using HMP exponentially decays as the shortest graph distance 𝑑 * 𝑔 between two nodes increases. In other words, distant nodes in dense areas will have less interaction, even if they are in a dense connected area. To alleviate the phenomenon, we propose a Curvature-based Homophily Constraint (𝜅HC) to enhance the connection within linked pairs. The basic idea is to push the embeddings of linked nodes closer if their ORC value is larger than a threshold. In this way, we can enforce disjoint node pairs in dense areas or clusters to have more Table 1: Comparisons of the abilities of models in terms of global tree-likeness modeling (Global), local heterogeneous structure learning (Local), and neighbor interaction (Neighbor) are indicated by ✓ for the presence of the ability and × for its absence.<h2>publication_ref</h2>['b17', 'b20']<h2>figure_ref</h2>[]<h2>table_ref</h2>[]<h2>heading</h2>Model Type Models Global Local Neighbor<h2>text</h2>Shallow models\nEUC × × × HYP ✓ × × Euclidean GNN models GCN × × ✓ GAT × × ✓ SAGE × × ✓ SGC × × ✓ Curvature GNN models CurvGN × ✓ ✓ 𝜅GCN ✓ × ✓ Hyperbolic GNN models HGCN ✓ × ✓ LGCN ✓ × ✓ Curvature-aware HGNN model 𝜅HGCN ✓ ✓ ✓\ninfluence on each other through their mutual neighbors, which is given by:\nL 𝜅ℎ𝑐 + = - 1 |𝐸 𝜅 | ∑︁ (𝑖,𝑗 ) ∈𝐸 𝜅 log 𝑝 (x ℓ,H 𝑖 , x ℓ,H 𝑗 ),(22)\nwhere 𝐸 𝜅 is\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}}
