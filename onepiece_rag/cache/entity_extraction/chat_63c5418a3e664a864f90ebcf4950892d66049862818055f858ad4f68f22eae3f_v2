We define M (|ν r |) and Q(|ν r |) as follows:\nLemma 12 is an extension of a similar result established in [37,Lemma 10.1,pp. 11]. There, it was shown that for r = 1, 2, . . . ,\nRecalling the definition of L(ν r ) in (157) and using the definitions of M (ν r ) and Q(ν r ) in ( 243) and (244), we have the following cases.\nThen for case (c), we further have the following two subcases. (c1) If |ν r | = 2, 3, . . . , r n , given (246), (247) and \nGiven Kn Pn = o(1), then ⌊µP n ⌋ ≥ ⌊(1 + ε)K n ⌋ for all n sufficiently large. Consequently, from (248) and (250), it follows that L(ν r ) = max {M (ν r ), Q(ν r )}.\nSummarizing cases (a), (b), and (c1)-(c2) above, given any |ν r |, we have L(ν r ) = max {M (ν r ), Q(ν r )} for all n sufficiently large. This yields\nWe will show the following result: for all n sufficiently large and for any r = 2, 3, . . . , n,\nClearly, if (252) holds, we can substitute (245) and ( 252) into (251) and obtain (193), which establishes Lemma 12.\nFor any given n and any given r, from (244), we get\nFrom Lemma 5.1 in Yagan [37], it follows that R.H.S. of (253 \nWe introduce a continuous variable γ and define f (γ, p n , p s ) as follows, where γ ≥ 1.\nFrom ( 255) and (256), we obtain R.H.S. of (254) = f (r, p n , p s ).\nNote that since r is an integer, we cannot take the partial derivative of f (r, p n , p s ) with respect to r. We have introduced continuous variable γ and hence can take the partial derivative of f (γ, p n , p s ) with respect to γ. We get\nwhere, in the last step, we used the fact that ln(1p n ) ≤ 0. Therefore, it's clear that\nGiven p n and p s , then f (γ, p n , p s ) is decreasing with respect to γ for γ ≥ 1. Then given r ≥ 2, (254) and (257), we have\nwhere in (259) we use 0 < p s < 1, 0 < ε < 1 and Fact 2 to obtain (1p s ) ε ≤ 1εp s ; and in (260) we use p e = p n p s ; and in (261) we use the 1x ≤ e -x that holds for any x ≥ 0.\nGiven p e = o(1), then p e ≤ 1 2 for all n sufficiently large.
