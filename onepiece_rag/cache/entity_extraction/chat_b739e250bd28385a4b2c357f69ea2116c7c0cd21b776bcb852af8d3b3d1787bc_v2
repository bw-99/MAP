HMP helps build the connection between the graph topology and the embedding space, adjust the curvature of the hyperbolic geometry, and guide the information flow. It also shortens the distance of two linked nodes in an area with many triangles, helping mitigate the distortion caused by hyperbolic space. Nonetheless, HMP is local inherently, and the proposed ùúÖHC further enhances the interactions of unconnected nodes, which is non-local.<h2>publication_ref</h2>['b10', 'b73']<h2>figure_ref</h2>[]<h2>table_ref</h2>[]<h2>heading</h2>ùúÖHGCN Architecture<h2>text</h2>Given the Euclidean feature x ùê∏ , we first project it into the hyperbolic manifold by the exponential map. ùúÖHGCN architecture takes layers of HMP as the encoder. Following the literature, the Fermi-Dirac function is used as a decoder in the link prediction task. For the node classification task, the final hyperbolic vector is mapped back to tangent space and decoded with MLP, which is the same with work [11]. 3 We select edges if their ORC value is larger than a threshold where edges can be constructed by multiple hop neighbors and the weight is added their curvature together based on their shortest distance. <h2>publication_ref</h2>['b10']<h2>figure_ref</h2>[]<h2>table_ref</h2>[]<h2>heading</h2>EXPERIMENTS 5.1 Experimental Setup<h2>text</h2>Datasets. The evaluation of our work utilizes several datasets, including Disease, Airport, and three benchmark citation networks, namely PubMed and Cora. While Disease and Airport exhibit a more hierarchical structure, the citation networks are less so, making them suitable for demonstrating the generalization capability of our proposal. In Table 2, we provide the data statistics and hyperbolicity metric that measures the tree-likeness of each graph. For further details, please refer to Appendix A.\nBaselines. We compare our proposed model with various baselines. ( 1) Shallow Euclidean and hyperbolic models, including Euclidean embeddings (EUC) and Poincar√© embeddings (HYP) [56];\n(2) Euclidean GNN models, i.e., GCN [35], GraphSAGE (SAGE) [28], Graph Attention Networks (GAT) [78], Simplified Graph Convolution, (SGC) [83]; (3) Curvature GNN models, including Curvature Graph Network (CurvGN) [93] which applies the discrete curvature in Euclidean model and ProdGCN which deploys GNNs to products of constant curvature spaces, both of them are close to our work; Hyperbolic GNNs, including HGCN [11], HGNN [45], HGAT [96],\nLGCN [97]. Table 1 presents the different features of the aforementioned models regarding their capabilities for perceiving both global tree-likeness modeling and local heterogeneous structure, as well as their interactional aptitude with regard to neighboring information.\nExperimental Details Data split. We evaluate ùúÖHGCN on both node classification and link prediction tasks. The data split is the same with the previous works [11]. More specifically, in link prediction, we randomly split edges into 85%, 5%, 10% for training, validation, and test sets, respectively. For node classification, we split nodes into 70%, 15%, 15% for Airport, 30%, 10%, 60% for Disease, and we use 20 labeled train examples per class for Cora, and PubMed. Implementation details. We closely follow the parameter settings as HGCN [11], fix the number of embedding dimensions to 16 and then perform hyper-parameter search on a validation set over learning rate, weight decay, dropout, and the number of layers. We also adopt the early stopping strategies based on the validation set as [11]. For baselines, we mainly refer to the reported results in the literature, and for the inconsistent cases (such as different embedding dimensions\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4-turbo-preview", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}}
