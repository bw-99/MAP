Also model size can be controlled by l, s and c.\nTo make a recommendation for an active user u a given the set of items T a the user likes and the set of association rules R (dependency model), the following steps are necessary:\n1. Find all matching rules X → Y for which X ⊆ T a in R.\n2. Recommend N unique right-hand-sides (Y) of the matching rules with the highest confidence (or another measure of interestingness).\nThe dependency model is very similar to item-based CF with conditional probability-based similarity (Deshpande and Karypis 2004). It can be fully precomputed and rules with more than one items in the left-hand-side (X ), it incorporates higher order effects between more than two items.<h2>publication_ref</h2>['b10', 'b31', 'b11', 'b26', 'b6', 'b0', 'b41', 'b16', 'b7']<h2>figure_ref</h2>[]<h2>table_ref</h2>[]<h2>heading</h2>Other collaborative filtering methods<h2>text</h2>Over time several other model-based approaches have been developed. A popular simple item-based approach is the Slope One algorithm (Lemire and Maclachlan 2005). Another family of algorithms is based on latent factors approach using matrix decomposition (Koren et al. 2009). More recently, deep learning has become a very popular method for flexible matrix completion, matrix factorization and collaborative ranking. A comprehensive survey is presented by Zhang, Yao, Sun, and Tay (2019).\nThese algorithms are outside the scope of this introductory paper.<h2>publication_ref</h2>['b25', 'b23', 'b42']<h2>figure_ref</h2>[]<h2>table_ref</h2>[]<h2>heading</h2>Evaluation of Recommender Algorithms<h2>text</h2>Evaluation of recommender systems is an important topic and reviews were presented by Herlocker, Konstan, Terveen, and Riedl ( 2004) and Gunawardana and Shani (2009). Typically, given a rating matrix R, recommender algorithms are evaluated by first partitioning the users (rows) in R into two sets U train ∪ U test = U. The rows of R corresponding to the training users U train are used to learn the recommender model. Then each user u a ∈ U test is seen as an active user. Before creating recommendations some items are withheld from the profile r ua• and it measured either how well the predicted rating matches the withheld value or, for top-N algorithms, if the items in the recommended list are rated highly by the user. Finally, the evaluation measures calculated for all test users are averaged.\nTo determine how to split U into U train and U test we can use several approaches (Kohavi 1995).\n• Splitting: We can randomly assign a predefined proportion of the users to the training set and all others to the test set.\n• Bootstrap sampling: We can sample from U test with replacement to create the training set and then use the users not in the training set as the test set. This procedure has the advantage that for smaller data sets we can create larger training sets and still have users left for testing.\n• k-fold cross-validation: Here we split U into k sets (called folds) of approximately the same size. Then we evaluate k times, always using one fold for testing and all other folds for leaning. The k results can be averaged. This approach makes sure that each user is at least once in the test set and the averaging produces more robust results and error estimates.\nThe items withheld in the test data are randomly chosen. Breese et al. (1998) introduced the four experimental protocols called Given 2, Given 5, Given 10 and All-but-1. For the Given x protocols for each user x randomly chosen items are given to the recommender algorithm and the remaining items are withheld for evaluation. For All but x the algorithm gets all but x withheld items.\nIn the following we discuss the evaluation of predicted ratings and then of top-N recommendation lists.<h2>publication_ref</h2>['b15', 'b21', 'b2']<h2>figure_ref</h2>[]<h2>table_ref</h2>[]<h2>heading</h2>Evaluation of predicted ratings<h2>text</h2>A typical way to evaluate a prediction is to compute the deviation of the prediction from the true value. This is the basis for the Mean Average Error (MAE) where K is the set of all user-item pairings (i, j) for which we have a predicted rating rij and a known rating r ij which was not used to learn the recommendation model.\nMAE = 1 |K| (i,j)∈K |r ij -rij |,(8)\nAnother popular measure is the Root Mean Square Error (RMSE).\nRMSE = (i,j)∈K (r ij -rij ) 2 |K| (9)\nRMSE penalizes larger errors stronger than MAE and thus is suitable for situations where small prediction errors are not very important.<h2>publication_ref</h2>[]<h2>figure_ref</h2>[]<h2>table_ref</h2>[]<h2>heading</h2>Evaluation Top-N
