For any point x, k-Pareto optimality of x is the likelihood a point drawn at random from the population strictly Pareto dominates x for R cf . Smaller values of po mean better fitness. Under the independence assumption of objectives and constraints, we can easily compute k-Pareto optimality po(x). When saying P ({y|yR = cf x}) = 0, we assume the considered objectives and constraints are not constant on too large sets. Without this simplification, the computation becomes longer, see the derivation below. Any cumulative probability distribution defined above, F i for f i and G i for g i , can be estimated via its empirical cumulative probability distribution. Note, for a population {x 1 , . . . , x k , . . . , x ps } of size ps, and for any real valued function f , the empirical cumulative probability distribution F of f is defined as follows:\nF (z) = #({x k |f (x k ) ≤ z}) ps .\nIn a similar way, P (y|yR hj x) can be estimated by H j * (h j (x)), where H j * (z) is defined as (10)\nH j * (z) =\nThe computation of every Fi can be performed as follows:\n• sort the values f (x k ) in increasing order, and store them in an array;\n• create two new arrays;\n• loop over the sorted values f (x k ); each time a new distinct value f (x k ) is encountered:\nappend the previously encountered f (x k )\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}}
