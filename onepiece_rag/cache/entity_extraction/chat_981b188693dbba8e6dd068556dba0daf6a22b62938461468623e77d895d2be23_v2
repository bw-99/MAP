Marharyta Aleksandrova; Thomas Engel<h1>pub_date</h1><h1>abstract</h1>Topological sorting 1 is an important technique in numerous practical applications, such as information retrieval, recommender systems, optimization, etc. In this paper, we introduce a problem of generalized topological sorting with maximization of choice, that is, of choosing a subset of items of a predefined size that contains the maximum number of equally preferable options (items) with respect to a dominance relation. We formulate this problem in a very abstract form and prove that sorting by k-Pareto optimality yields a valid solution. Next, we show that the proposed theory can be useful in practice. We apply it during the selection step of genetic optimization and demonstrate that the resulting algorithm outperforms existing state-of-the-art approaches such as NSGA-II and NSGA-III. We also demonstrate that the provided general formulation allows discovering interesting relationships and applying the developed theory to different applications. 1 Topological sorting [E. Knuth, 1997]  here means the process of sorting a set of items with respect to a preference or dominance relation. We use the terms preference and dominance interchangeably. 2 We use the terms item and element interchangeably.<h1>sections</h1><h2>heading</h2>Introduction<h2>text</h2>In the modern era of information overload, the task of choosing a subset of the most useful items is extremely important. Various tools were developed with the aim to assist a user with this task, for example, text search engines [Croft et al., 2010] and recommender systems [Resnick and Varian, 1997]. In most of the cases, such systems suggest to the user a small set of elements 2 . Thereby, if the number of equally preferable options is large, a heuristic is used to discard a fraction of them. However, in some applications the user might be willing to analyze all equally preferable options with the aim to choose the best one. This can happen, for example, in the case of choosing a habitation.\nA similar problem of choosing a subset of most preferable elements also arises as an important step when solving various practical tasks. A straightforward example would be the selection step in genetic optimization algorithms [Mitchell, 1998]. At this step, a subset of the current population is chosen to advance to the next generation. Having the chosen subset made up of elements with large fitness values guides the evolution process in the desired direction. At the same time, selecting a subset with the largest variety of genes ensures variability of characteristics and allows faster exploration of the search space.\nThese examples\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}}
