Here, clustering around the center suggests minimal impact on most genes, whereas known differentially expressed genes (DEGs) (blue points) significantly diverge. sc-OTGM accurately ranked BIN1 as a knockeddown gene, placing it at the top of the recommendation list. In the presented confusion matrix, cells are classified as either Control-indicating no CRISPR-induced changes-or Perturbed-where changes are expected. True negatives (56) correctly identify cells as Control; false positives (18) erroneously label cells as Perturbed; false negatives (5) miss the classification of Perturbed cells as Control; and true positives (8) correctly detect Perturbed cells. Additionally, we used in silico perturbation response predictions to analyze gene expression changes between BIN1-knockdown and control cells, as shown in Figure3.<h2>figure_data</h2><h2>figure_label</h2>23<h2>figure_type</h2>figure<h2>figure_id</h2>fig_2<h2>figure_caption</h2>Figure 2 :Figure 3 :23Figure 2: Perturbation distribution from the OT landscape, and ranking genes for target identification through a recommender system.<h2>figure_data</h2><h2>figure_label</h2><h2>figure_type</h2>figure<h2>figure_id</h2>fig_3<h2>figure_caption</h2>min π∈Π(µ,ν) X×Y c(x, y) dπ(x, y) + ϵ KL(π∥µ ⊗ ν) A.3 DATASET STATISTICS<h2>figure_data</h2><h2>figure_label</h2><h2>figure_type</h2>figure<h2>figure_id</h2>fig_5<h2>figure_caption</h2>for i in range(1, num_iterations + 1):# Hit-and-Run sampling for X direction_x = np.random.randn(len(mean1)) lb_x, ub_x = get_non_zero_density_bounds( cov1, x_current, direction_x ) x_current = np.random.uniform(lb_x, ub_x) # Hit-and-Run sampling for Y direction_y = np.random.randn(len(mean2)) lb_y, ub_y = get_non_zero_density_bounds( cov2, y_current, direction_y ) y_current = np.random.uniform(lb_y, ub_y) # Sequential update on cross-covariance matrix deviation_x = x_current -mean1 deviation_y = y_current -mean2 cross_covariance = (i / (i + 1)) * cross_covariance + ( i / (i + 1) ** 2 ) * np.outer(deviation_x, deviation_y) # Update rmse values and frobenius_norms rmse = np.sqrt(np.mean((cross_covariance -ground_truth) ** 2)) rmse_values.append(rmse) fro_norm = np.linalg.norm(cross_covariance -ground_truth, \"fro\") normalized_fro_norm = fro_norm / np.sqrt((dimension ** 2)) frobenius_norms.append(normalized_fro_norm) return cross_covariance, rmse_values, frobenius_norms cross-covariance for a given dimension with an imposed correlation factor.
