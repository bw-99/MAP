Precisely if S is a selection such that µ(S) = µ(T k ), and div(S) = div(T k ), then S = T k almost everywhere.\nC Further Practical Exploration of at least k-Pareto optimal elements </p><h2>publication_ref</h2> <p>[] </p><h2>figure_ref</h2> <p>[] </p><h2>table_ref</h2> <p>[] </p><h2>heading</h2> <p>C.1 Additional Results for Genetic Optimization </p><h2>text</h2> <p>In Section 5.2, we evaluate the performance of the genetic algorithms using the hypervolume indicator. In this section, we further analyze the behavior of both the state-of-the-art and the proposed algorithms with respect to other metrics. In particular, we study the fraction of solutions dominated by the solution of alternative algorithms and analyze the time complexity of the sorting procedure.\nWe calculate the percentage of dominated solutions as follows. For a given pair of algorithms algorithm1 and algorithm2, we calculate how many solutions of algorithm2 (dominated algorithm) are dominated by solutions of algorithm1 (dominating algorithm). After that, we average the obtained results among all dominating algorithms to get an average fraction of dominated solutions, denoted by θ. Naturally, lower values of θ indicate better performance. We present the corresponding results in Fig. 14. We notice the following tendencies. NSGA-II and PO-count behave very similarly. For n k = 2, the value of θ for these algorithms is around 20%. After that, it starts increasing and reaches its peak of approximately 45% for n k = 7. Finally, it gradually decreases to 24% for n k = 25. NSGA-III starts at a similar level and reaches its peak of approximately 30% for n k = 5. After that, it decreases below 10% for n k = 7 and stays relatively close to 0 for the larger numbers of knapsacks. These results demonstrate the superiority of NSGA-III over NSGA-II in the case of many-objective optimization. PO-prob starts at around 16%. However, for n k = 4 the value of θ it already almost 0 and does not go up for larger numbers of knapsacks. This shows that the solutions produced by this algorithm are rarely dominated. Thereby, PO-prob is an effective approach for many-objective optimization problems. In Fig. 15, we demonstrate the dependence of sorting time on the population size for values of pop size ranging from 50 to 500. The reported values are the averages over 100 independent executions of one iteration of the corresponding genetic algorithm. From the figure, we can see that PO-prob requires much less time than all other algorithm. The results for NSGA-II and PO-count tend to be very close, as in other experiments. This observation also has theoretical explanation. Indeed, choosing the next generation for NSGA-II and NSGA-III has time complexity of O(N 2 M ) and max{O(N 2 M ), O(N 2 log M -2 N )} respectively where M stands for number of objectives and N is the population size, see [Deb et al., 2002,Deb andJain, 2013]. At the same time, sorting in PO-prob comes down to independent sorting procedures with respect to every objective. The time complexity of this procedure is O(N M log(N )). These results are in line with the theoretical analysis presented in Section 5.1 and prove the computational efficiency of the approximate ranking calculation procedure used in PO-prob.\nThe maximum choice theorem (Theorem 1) has an intuitive interpretation in the context of genetic algorithms. Assume that the selection step is required to pick a selection of a given maximum size for breeding offspring, and both parents are chosen independently and at random form this selection. Then selections obtained via k-Pareto optimality-based sorting yield most offspring with parents offering choice. Choice here means that every parent is strictly superior to the other with respect to at least one objective, or both have the same values of all objectives. </p><h2>publication_ref</h2> <p>[] </p><h2>figure_ref</h2> <p>['fig_11', 'fig_12'] </p><h2>table_ref</h2> <p>[] </p><h2>heading</h2> <p>C.2 Kendall's τ Rank Correlation Coefficient and Statistical Tests </p><h2>text</h2> <p>Let us again consider the case of 2 continuous random variables introduced in Section 4.2. Let us assume that X 2 = f (X 1 ) for some increasing function f . For almost all (x, y), either xRy or yRx holds. Thus div(Ω) = 0. Moreover, diversity only depends on the copula which encodes the dependency structure between X 1 and X 2 , see Section 4.2.2 and Appendix B.3. Therefore, a value of div(Ω) close to zero indicates X 1 and X 2 are strongly correlated via an increasing function. It leads to the idea that Kendall's τ rank correlation coefficient [Kendall, 1948] and diversity are strongly related concepts.\nLet us consider a sample\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>K-PARETO OPTIMAL ELEMENTS<|>CONCEPT<|>K-Pareto optimal elements refer to a set of solutions in multi-objective optimization that cannot be improved in any objective without degrading another objective, indicating a state of optimality in decision-making processes.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GENETIC ALGORITHMS<|>CONCEPT<|>Genetic algorithms are search heuristics that mimic the process of natural selection to generate high-quality solutions for optimization and search problems, often used in various fields including artificial intelligence and operations research.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>NSGA-II<|>ALGORITHM<|>NSGA-II (Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm II) is a popular multi-objective optimization algorithm that uses a fast non-dominated sorting approach to rank solutions and maintain diversity in the population.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>NSGA-III<|>ALGORITHM<|>NSGA-III (Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm III) is an extension of NSGA-II designed to handle many-objective optimization problems more effectively, focusing on maintaining diversity among solutions.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PO-PROB<|>ALGORITHM<|>PO-prob is a genetic algorithm that employs a probabilistic approach to optimize solutions in many-objective optimization problems, demonstrating efficiency in producing non-dominated solutions.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>HYPERVOLUME INDICATOR<|>CONCEPT<|>The hypervolume indicator is a metric used to measure the quality of a set of solutions in multi-objective optimization by calculating the volume of the objective space that is dominated by the solutions.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>TIME COMPLEXITY<|>CONCEPT<|>Time complexity refers to the computational complexity that describes the amount of time it takes to run an algorithm as a function of the length of the input, often expressed using Big O notation.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>K-PARETO OPTIMAL ELEMENTS<|>GENETIC ALGORITHMS<|>K-Pareto optimal elements are often the target solutions that genetic algorithms aim to identify and optimize in multi-objective optimization problems<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>NSGA-II<|>GENETIC ALGORITHMS<|>NSGA-II is a specific type of genetic algorithm that focuses on non-dominated sorting for multi-objective optimization<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>NSGA-III<|>GENETIC ALGORITHMS<|>NSGA-III is an advanced genetic algorithm designed to improve upon the capabilities of NSGA-II in many-objective optimization scenarios<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PO-PROB<|>GENETIC ALGORITHMS<|>PO-prob is a genetic algorithm that utilizes a probabilistic method to enhance performance in many-objective optimization problems<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>HYPERVOLUME INDICATOR<|>GENETIC ALGORITHMS<|>The hypervolume indicator is a performance metric used to evaluate the effectiveness of genetic algorithms in producing high-quality solutions<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>TIME COMPLEXITY<|>GENETIC ALGORITHMS<|>Time complexity is a critical factor in assessing the efficiency of genetic algorithms, influencing their performance and scalability<|>5)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
