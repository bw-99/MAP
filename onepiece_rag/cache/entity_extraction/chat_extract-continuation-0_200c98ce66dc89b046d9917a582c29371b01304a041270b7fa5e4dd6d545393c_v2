These graphs have received much attention and also been used in diverse application areas beyond secure sensor networks; e.g., cryptanalysis, social networks, and recommender systems. Formally, a random key graph with n nodes is constructed by assigning each node Xn keys selected uniformly at random from a pool of Yn keys and then putting an undirected edge between any two nodes sharing at least one key. Considerable progress has been made in the literature to analyze connectivity and k-connectivity of random key graphs; e.g., Yagan and Makowski [ISIT '09, Trans. IT'12] on connectivity under Xn = Ω( √ ln n ), Rybarczyk [Discrete Mathematics '11] on connectivity under Xn ≥ 2, and our recent work [CDC '14] on k-connectivity under Xn = Ω( √ ln n ), where k-connectivity of a graph ensures connectivity even after the removal of k nodes or k edges. Yet, it still remains an open question for k-connectivity in random key graphs under Xn ≥ 2 and Xn = o( √ ln n ) (the case of Xn = 1 is trivial). In this paper, we answer the above problem by providing an exact analysis of k-connectivity in random key graphs under Xn ≥ 2. </p><h1>sections</h1><h2>heading</h2> <p>I. INTRODUCTION </p><h2>text</h2> <p>Random key graphs, also known as homogeneous random intersection graphs, have been investigated widely in the literature [1], [2], [5]- [7], [9], [10], [12], [13]. The notion of random key graph results from the seminal Eschenauer-Gligor (EG) random key predistribution scheme [4], which is the most recognized solution to secure communication using cryptographic keys in wireless sensor networks [10]. The definition of a random key graph can also be generalized beyond cryptographic keys. Consider a random key graph G(n, X n , Y n ) that is constructed on a set of n nodes as follows. Each node is independently assigned a set of X n distinct objects, selected uniformly at random from a pool of Y n objects, where X n and Y n are both functions of n. An undirected edge exists between two nodes if and only if they possess at least one common object. An object is a cryptographic key in the application of random key graphs to the Eschenauer-Gligor random key predistribution scheme. In addition to the area of secure sensor networks, random key graphs have also been used in various applications including cryptanalysis [1], social networks [12], and recommender systems [5].\n(k-)Connectivity of a random key graph has received much interest [2], [6], [7], [9], [10], [12], [13]. A graph is said to be k-connected if it remains connected despite the deletion of at most (k -1) nodes or edges 1 ; an equivalent definition of k-connectivity is that for each pair of nodes there exist at least k mutually disjoint paths connecting them [3]. In the case of k being 1, k-connectivity becomes connectivity, meaning that each node in the graph can find at least one path to any other node, either directly or with the help of other relaying nodes. A graph property related to and implied by k-connectivity is that the minimum degree of the the graph is at least k (i.e., each node is directly connected to no less than k other nodes), where the minimum degree refers to the minimum among the numbers of neighbors that nodes have.\nWe investigate k-connectivity of random key graphs. Our contribution is, for a random key graph, to derive the asymptotically exact probabilities for k-connectivity and the property that the minimum degree is at least k.\nThe rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section II presents the results. We elaborate the proof of Theorem 1 in Section III. Section IV provides numerical findings to support the theoretical results. Section V surveys related work; and Section VI concludes the paper. </p><h2>publication_ref</h2> <p>['b0', 'b1', 'b4', 'b6', 'b8', 'b9', 'b11', 'b12', 'b3', 'b9', 'b0', 'b11', 'b4', 'b1', 'b5', 'b6', 'b8', 'b9', 'b11', 'b12', 'b2'] </p><h2>figure_ref</h2> <p>[] </p><h2>table_ref</h2> <p>[] </p><h2>heading</h2> <p>II.
