Hence, we dimension iMARS with 32 banks (B=32) to accomodate all these features. The other features are also mapped accordingly,  with some mats and CMAs deactivated in a bank according to the size of the ET. We use 26 activated banks, 104 activated mats and 2860 activated CMAs for the Criteo Kaggle dataset.\nFor the MovieLens dataset (also used in our evaluation), due to the much smaller number of rows per ET, we are still able to use the same architecture while keeping idle arrays deactivated. The MovieLens dataset uses 5 UIET for the filtering stage and 6 UIET for the ranking stage (Table I), 5 of which are shared between the filtering and ranking stages. ETs have a maximum of 6040 entries and a minimum of 3 entries. We use 7 active banks, 8 active mat and 54 active CMA in the MovieLens dataset. </p><h2>publication_ref</h2> <p>['b1', 'b0'] </p><h2>figure_ref</h2> <p>[] </p><h2>table_ref</h2> <p>['tab_0', 'tab_0'] </p><h2>heading</h2> <p>A.

Energy and Latency Evaluation </p><h2>text</h2> <p>We estimated the energy and latency of iMARS based on the mapping and the simulated array-level FoM. As the latency and energy improvement of TCAM arrays and crossbars are well studied in previous work [5] [22], in this section we mainly focus on our findings on ET lookup operations, which is also a bottleneck of the RecSys. We compare the latency and energy of TCAM-based LSH search with the LSH search on GPU as well as the original cosine search on GPU. Finally we report the end-to-end system comparison.\n1) ET lookup operation: Table III shows the latency and energy consumption of the ET lookup operation in the two RecSys instances as well as on GPU. All the data are obtained for one item input. The ET lookup operation in iMARS includes the multiple lookups of CMAs, the intra-mat addition and intra-bank addition. To estimate the latency and energy on iMARS, we consider the worst case that all lookups for one ET happen in the same array. Multiple lookups in one array requires multiple read, write and in-memory add operations, incurring higher latency and energy. We also include the latency/energy overhead of communication due to wiring and serialization with the RSC bus/IBC network. Thus, under the aforesaid worst case, the iMARS takes 0.24 ¬µs latency and 6.88 ¬µJ energy for a single input on the Criteo Kaggle dataset and achieves 61.83√ó latency and 47.9√ó energy improvement. For the MovieLens dataset, the iMARS achieves 43.1√ó/45.6√ó speedup and 516.05√ó/458.12√ó energy reduction over the GPU counterpart on the filtering/ranking stages.\nFrom Table III, it can be seen that on both GPU and iMARS, the ranking stage takes more time and energy than the filtering stage for MovieLens because the ranking stage deploys one more ET than the filtering stage as the memory\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>KAGGLE DATASET<|>concept<|>The Kaggle dataset consists of 26 sparse features used for ranking in machine learning models, specifically in the context of recommendation systems.)\n(\"entity\"<|>IMARS<|>concept<|>iMARS is an in-memory-computing architecture designed to enhance the performance of recommendation systems by optimizing the filtering and ranking stages.)\n(\"entity\"<|>CRITEO DATASET<|>concept<|>The Criteo dataset is utilized in machine learning experiments, featuring a specific configuration of activated banks, mats, and CMAs for processing.)\n(\"entity\"<|>MOVIELENS DATASET<|>concept<|>The MovieLens dataset is a smaller dataset used for evaluating recommendation systems, employing a different architecture configuration compared to the Criteo dataset.)\n(\"entity\"<|>ET LOOKUP OPERATION<|>concept<|>ET lookup operation refers to the process of accessing and retrieving data from embedding tables in recommendation systems, which can impact latency and energy consumption.)\n(\"entity\"<|>LATENCY<|>concept<|>Latency is the time delay experienced in a system, particularly in the context of data retrieval and processing in recommendation systems.)\n(\"entity\"<|>ENERGY CONSUMPTION<|>concept<|>Energy consumption refers to the amount of energy used during the operation of recommendation systems, particularly during data processing and retrieval.)\n(\"entity\"<|>FILTERING STAGE<|>concept<|>The filtering stage is a part of the recommendation system process where items are filtered based on user preferences and historical data.)\n(\"entity\"<|>RANKING STAGE<|>concept<|>The ranking stage follows the filtering stage in recommendation systems, where the filtered items are ranked according to their predicted relevance to the user.)\n(\"relationship\"<|>KAGGLE DATASET<|>IMARS<|>The Kaggle dataset is processed using the iMARS architecture to optimize the ranking of items in recommendation systems<|>8)\n(\"relationship\"<|>CRITEO DATASET<|>IMARS<|>The Criteo dataset is utilized within the iMARS architecture, which manages the activated banks, mats, and CMAs for efficient processing<|>8)\n(\"relationship\"<|>MOVIELENS DATASET<|>IMARS<|>The MovieLens dataset is also processed using the iMARS architecture, albeit with a different configuration due to its smaller size<|>7)\n(\"relationship\"<|>ET LOOKUP OPERATION<|>IMARS<|>The ET lookup operation is a critical function within the iMARS architecture, affecting its overall performance<|>9)\n(\"relationship\"<|>LATENCY<|>ET LOOKUP OPERATION<|>Latency is a key metric evaluated during the ET lookup operation, impacting the efficiency of recommendation systems<|>8)\n(\"relationship\"<|>ENERGY CONSUMPTION<|>ET LOOKUP OPERATION<|>Energy consumption is measured during the ET lookup operation, highlighting the operational costs of recommendation systems<|>8)\n(\"relationship\"<|>FILTERING STAGE<|>MOVIELENS DATASET<|>The filtering stage is applied to the MovieLens dataset to refine the items based on user preferences<|>7)\n(\"relationship\"<|>RANKING STAGE<|>MOVIELENS DATASET<|>The ranking stage follows the filtering stage for the MovieLens dataset, determining the order of items based on relevance<|>7)\n(\"relationship\"<|>FILTERING STAGE<|>IMARS<|>The filtering stage is optimized by the iMARS architecture to enhance the performance of recommendation systems<|>8)\n(\"relationship\"<|>RANKING STAGE<|>IMARS<|>The ranking stage is also enhanced by the iMARS architecture, improving the efficiency of item ranking in recommendation systems<|>8) \n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
