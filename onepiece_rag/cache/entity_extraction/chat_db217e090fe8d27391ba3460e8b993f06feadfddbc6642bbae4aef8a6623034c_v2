Suppose that y and ω i for i = 1, 2, . . . , k -1 are given, in which y ≥ 0 and 0 ≤ ω i ≤ T i . Let t k be T k + y. Now, we set t i to ω i + T k +y-ωi Ti T i for i = 1, 2, . . . , k -1 and reindex the tasks such that t 1 ≤ t 2 ≤ . . . ≤ t k . Therefore, if i < j, we know that\nω i • U i + tj -ωi Ti C i ≤ ω i • U i + ( ti-ωi Ti + 1)C i = t i U i + C i . If i ≥ j, then ω i • U i + tj -ωi Ti C i ≤ ω i • U i + ( ti-ωi Ti )C i = t i U i .\nThe sufficient schedulability condition in Lemma 9 under the given y and ω i s is to verify the existence of t j ∈ {t 1 , t 2 , . . . t k } such that\nU max k (T k + y) + k-1 i=1 ω i • U i + tj -ωi Ti C i M (50) ≤U max k t k + k-1 i=1 U i t i + j-1 i=1 C i M ≤ t j .(51)\nBy the definition of global RM scheduling (i.e., T k ≥ T i ), we can conclude that \nC i = U i T i ≤ U i T k ≤ U i (T k +y) = U i t k for i = 1, 2, . . . ,\nU max k t k + k-1 i=1 α i U i t i + j-1 i=1 βU i t k ≤ t j ,(52)\nwhere α i = 1 M and β ≤ 1 M for i = 1, 2, . . . , k -1. Therefore, we reach the conclusion of the schedulability conditions in Eqs. ( 48) and (49) by Lemma 3 and Lemma 4 under given y and ω i s, respectively.\nThe schedulability test in Eq. ( 52) is independent from the settings of y and ω i s. However, the setting of y and ω i s affects how the k -1 higher-priority tasks are indexed. Fortunately, it can be observed that the schedulability tests in Eqs. ( 48) and (49) are completely independent upon the indexing of the higher-priority tasks. Therefore, no matter how y and ω i s are set, the schedulability conditions in Eqs. ( 48) and ( 49) are the corresponding results from the k 2 Q framework. As a result, we can reach the conclusion.\nCorollary 3. The capacity augmentation factor of global RM for a sporadic system with implicit deadlines is 3+ \n∆ max k ≤ 1 - 1 M k-1 i=1 U i + C i D k + 1 M 2 k-1 i=1 U i ( k-1 =i C D k ) ,(53\n) where the k -1 higher-priority tasks are ordered in a nonincreasing order of their periods.\nProof: This is due to a similar proof to that of Theorem 8 and Lemma 9, by applying Lemma 1 with\nt k = D k + y, α i = 1\nM , and β i = 1 M , under the worst-case last release time ordering, βiCi αiUi = T i non-increasingly, in Lemma 2. Therefore, for a given y ≥ 0, if\n∆ max k ≤ 1 -1 M k-1 i=1 U i + Ci D k +y + 1 M 2 k-1 i=1 U i ( k-1 =i C D k +y )\n, task τ k is schedulable by the global fixed-scheduling. By the assumption 8 This comes from the simple algebra property that for any two vectors a and b of size is minimized when y is 0. As a result, the above schedulability condition is the worst when y is 0.\nk-1 i=1 U i ≤ M , we know that C i i =1 U M ≤ C i . Therefore 8 , - 1 M k-1 i=1 C i D k + y + 1 M 2 k-1 i=1 U i ( k-1 =i C D k + y ) = 1 D k + y 1 M - k-1 i=1 C i + k-1 i=1 C i i =1 U M\n(k -1) there is k-1 i=1 a i k-1 =i b = k-1 i=1 b i i =1 a . x z J z -1 J -1 J3 z2 J2 z1 J1 z0 • • • • • • • • • •\nCorollary 4. The capacity augmentation factor and the speedup factor of global DM by using Theorem 9 for a sporadic system with constrained deadlines is 3.\nProof: If k i=1 U i ≤ M or k-1 i=1 Ci D k ≤ M is violated,\nthe capacity augmentation factor is already 1.
