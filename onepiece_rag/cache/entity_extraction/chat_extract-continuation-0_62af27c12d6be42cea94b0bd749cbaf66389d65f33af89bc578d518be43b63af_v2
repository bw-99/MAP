We summarize our major contributions as:\n• We propose a hierarchical training framework that uses instance-wise \"Bernoulli gates\" to facilitate effective dimension search for each sample. • We apply a sparse and bi-polarization regularizer in the objective function to help the model learn distinguishable Bernoulli RVs, and use a threshold selector for downstream deterministic selection. • To balance the trade-off between the one-size-for-all and full-customization (which is not applicable with finite data size) strategies, we propose to divide samples into clusters and develop tailored recommender models for each cluster.\nWe empirically evaluate the performance of our framework on two large-scale benchmark datasets. Our experimental results indicate a notable superiority of our approach over various state-of-the-art baseline models on both datasets. Furthermore, the transferability analysis demonstrates our framework can be effectively transferred to diverse deep recommender models, thereby enhancing their performance. Additionally, our framework offers an efficiency advantage as it requires less inference time than competing baseline models. </p><h2>publication_ref</h2> <p>['b2', 'b26', 'b8', 'b38', 'b5', 'b7', 'b13', 'b25', 'b33', 'b7', 'b9', 'b28', 'b14', 'b24', 'b32', 'b31', 'b34', 'b17', 'b32'] </p><h2>figure_ref</h2> <p>[] </p><h2>table_ref</h2> <p>[] </p><h2>heading</h2> <p>RELATED WORK </p><h2>text</h2> <p>This section introduces the main related works to our study, focusing on feature-based recommender models and AutoML approaches for recommendation systems. </p><h2>publication_ref</h2> <p>[] </p><h2>figure_ref</h2> <p>[] </p><h2>table_ref</h2> <p>[] </p><h2>heading</h2> <p>Feature-based Recommender Models </p><h2>text</h2> <p>Feature-based recommender models take sparse, high-dimensional features from users and items as input and transform them into low-dimensional representations to capture user preferences for improved recommendations. For example, Cheng et al. [4] propose Wide&Deep (W&D), a model composed of a linear module and a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) layer to combine the benefits of memorization and generalization for recommender systems. Guo et al. [8] propose DeepFM that further integrates the power of factorization machines based on W&D to learn high-order feature interactions for recommendations. Recently, advanced neural networks, such as attention-based models [29], have been developed. However, these techniques apply a fixed embedding dimension for all features, which would downgrade the model performance and consume substantial computational resources. </p><h2>publication_ref</h2> <p>['b3', 'b7', 'b28'] </p><h2>figure_ref</h2> <p>[] </p><h2>table_ref</h2> <p>[] </p><h2>heading</h2> <p>AutoML for Recommendations </p><h2>text</h2> <p>Automated Machine Learning (AutoML) has recently become a research hotspot due to its potential to automate the design process for recommender systems, minimizing human involvement. The research directions include feature selection [15,33], embedding dimension search [37,38], model architecture search [5], and other component search [30,31,36]. Feature selection involves selecting a subset of field features in recommendation systems. For example, AutoField [33] uses a simple controller based on differentiable architecture search [16] to select the top 𝐾 field features. AdaFS [15] enhances AutoField by modifying the controller to assign feature weights to fields for different samples. The objective of embedding dimension search is to find mixed embedding sizes for each field. For example, AutoEmb [38] finds the optimal dimension for each feature using differentiable search [16]. AutoDim [37] selects the best dimension for each field from a group of candidate dimensions in the same way as AutoEmb. Model architecture search explores various network architectures and selects the optimal one [5].\nOur method is in alignment with embedding dimension search. All instances in the above methods share a uniform dimension size for each field. In contrast, our approach adaptively selects dimensions for each instance via the proposed Bernoulli gates, thereby considering the difference between individuals. Moreover, we introduce a polarization regularizer to overcome the shortcomings of the commonly-used top 𝐾 selection strategy. Furthermore, rather than processing all samples through a single model, we propose to divide samples into clusters and train different recommender models with optimal dimensions tailored to different clusters. These unique and innovative designs in our proposed method have been proven effective in terms of both performance enhancement and inference cost saving. </p><h2>publication_ref</h2> <p>['b14', 'b32', 'b36', 'b37', 'b4', 'b29', 'b30', 'b35', 'b32', 'b15', 'b14', 'b37', 'b15', 'b36', 'b4'] </p><h2>figure_ref</h2> <p>[] </p><h2>table_ref</h2> <p>[] </p><h2>heading</h2> <p>METHOD </p><h2>text</h2> <p>This section introduces the technical specifications\n######################\noutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>BERNOULLI GATES<|>CONCEPT<|>Bernoulli gates are instance-wise mechanisms proposed to facilitate effective dimension search for each sample in a hierarchical training framework for recommender systems.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SPARSE AND BI-POLARIZATION REGULARIZER<|>CONCEPT<|>The sparse and bi-polarization regularizer is an objective function component that helps the model learn distinguishable Bernoulli random variables (RVs) and aids in downstream deterministic selection.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>RECOMMENDER MODELS<|>CONCEPT<|>Recommender models are algorithms designed to predict user preferences and provide personalized recommendations based on user and item features.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CLUSTERING<|>CONCEPT<|>Clustering is a technique used to divide samples into groups, allowing for the development of tailored recommender models for each cluster.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>AUTO MACHINE LEARNING (AUTOML)<|>CONCEPT<|>Automated Machine Learning (AutoML) is a research area focused on automating the design process for recommender systems, reducing the need for human intervention.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>FEATURE SELECTION<|>CONCEPT<|>Feature selection is the process of selecting a subset of relevant features for use in model construction, particularly in recommendation systems.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>EMBEDDING DIMENSION SEARCH<|>CONCEPT<|>Embedding dimension search involves finding optimal embedding sizes for features in recommendation systems to improve model performance.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MODEL ARCHITECTURE SEARCH<|>CONCEPT<|>Model architecture search is the process of exploring various network architectures to identify the most effective one for a given task.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>WIDE&DEEP (W&D)<|>CONCEPT<|>Wide&Deep (W&D) is a model that combines a linear module and a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) layer to leverage both memorization and generalization in recommender systems.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DEEPFM<|>CONCEPT<|>DeepFM is a model that integrates factorization machines with Wide&Deep to learn high-order feature interactions for improved recommendations.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BERNOULLI GATES<|>RECOMMENDER MODELS<|>Bernoulli gates are utilized within recommender models to enhance the dimension search process for individual samples, improving model performance.<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SPARSE AND BI-POLARIZATION REGULARIZER<|>RECOMMENDER MODELS<|>The sparse and bi-polarization regularizer aids recommender models in learning distinguishable features, enhancing their predictive capabilities.<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CLUSTERING<|>RECOMMENDER MODELS<|>Clustering allows for the creation of specialized recommender models tailored to different user groups, improving recommendation accuracy.<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>AUTO MACHINE LEARNING (AUTOML)<|>RECOMMENDER MODELS<|>AutoML techniques are applied to optimize the design and performance of recommender models, minimizing manual effort.<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>FEATURE SELECTION<|>AUTO MACHINE LEARNING (AUTOML)<|>Feature selection is a critical component of AutoML, as it determines which features are most relevant for building effective recommendation systems.<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>EMBEDDING DIMENSION SEARCH<|>AUTO MACHINE LEARNING (AUTOML)<|>Embedding dimension search is a focus area within AutoML, aimed at optimizing the representation of features in recommendation systems.<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MODEL ARCHITECTURE SEARCH<|>AUTO MACHINE LEARNING (AUTOML)<|>Model architecture search is another aspect of AutoML that seeks to identify the best network structures for recommendation tasks.<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>WIDE&DEEP (W&D)<|>RECOMMENDER MODELS<|>Wide&Deep (W&D) is a specific type of recommender model that combines different learning strategies to enhance recommendation performance.<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>DEEPFM<|>RECOMMENDER MODELS<|>DeepFM builds upon the principles of Wide&Deep to further improve the learning of feature interactions in recommender systems.<|>7)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
