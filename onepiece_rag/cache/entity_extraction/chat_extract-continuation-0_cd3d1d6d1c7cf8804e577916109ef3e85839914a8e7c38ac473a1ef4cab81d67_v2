The feature-augmented method offers a more flexible and adaptive way to synthesize information from various sources, thus resulting in improved performance.<h2>publication_ref</h2>[]<h2>figure_ref</h2>[]<h2>table_ref</h2>['tab_5']<h2>heading</h2>Effectiveness of 𝜅HC<h2>text</h2>Figure 5 displays the results of adding 𝜅HC or not on 𝜅HGCN. As it observed, the performance degenerates substantially on DISEASE when applying 𝜅HC, while there are significant improvements on the three citation networks, i.e., PubMed, and Cora. This phenomenon can be understood as follows. Adding 𝜅HC as in node classification will force linked nodes to obtain more similar representations. For the pure tree-like dataset, i.e., DISEASE (without any triangle and circle), these node pairs belong to different levels, and adding 𝜅HC impairs the learning of asymmetric dependencies, which further affects the establishment of hierarchical awareness. When it comes to the citation networks instead, 𝜅HC helps to reduce the distortion caused by hyperbolic geometry and thus boost the learning.<h2>publication_ref</h2>[]<h2>figure_ref</h2>['fig_3']<h2>table_ref</h2>[]<h2>heading</h2>Case Study of Ricci Curvature Weights<h2>text</h2>In this section, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our method through a case study. We extract a subtree centered on a randomly sampled node (node 10, in this case), from the Disease dataset, where node 2 is from a higher level and the remaining nodes (42,43,44,45) belong to a lower level. The edges depict disease propagation paths. As shown in the upper sub-figures of Figure 6, we display the corresponding edge weights assigned by both 𝜅HGCN and HGCN during the node classification task. The comparison between the two reveals that 𝜅HGCN (upper right) effectively distinguishes node levels, as it assigns greater importance to the parent node (node 2) and equally emphasizes the child nodes from the same level, whereas HGCN (upper left) fails to make such distinctions. This substantiates the importance of ORC in facilitating hierarchical learning.\nFurthermore, we illustrate a subgraph with triangles selected from the citation network, Cora, as depicted in the lower two sub-figures of Figure 6. This subgraph comprises nodes 𝑜, 𝑒, 𝑑 that form a triangle. We examine the edge weights around node 𝑜 and present the results in the lower two sub-figures of Figure 6. Observing these results, it is evident that 𝜅HGCN (as shown in the lower right) effectively identifies the local triangle structure and assigns larger weights to promote inter-node message exchange. In contrast, HGCN (as depicted in the lower left) fails to grasp the intricate topology in this area. These observations further attest to the efficacy of our proposed method in uncovering local clusters and mitigating the distortions imposed by hyperbolic geometry.<h2>publication_ref</h2>['b41', 'b42', 'b43', 'b44']<h2>figure_ref</h2>['fig_4', 'fig_4', 'fig_4']<h2>table_ref</h2>[]<h2>heading</h2>CONCLUSION<h2>text</h2>For modeling tree-like structures, the hyperbolic space has demonstrated its ability to capture hierarchical relationships. However, approximating a discrete tree-like graph with a hyperbolic manifold can result in inevitable distortions, as real-world tree-like graphs are inherently complex. In this work, we integrate the intrinsic graph structure into the continuous hyperbolic embedding space via the discrete Ricci curvature. As expected, the graph curvature facilitates the node to perceive the role and the hierarchy it belongs to, helping accelerate the hierarchical formation as well as alleviate the distortion in local clusters or cliques. The superiority of the proposal is demonstrated by extensive experiments. Curvature is a geometric notion with appealing and descriptive properties for both network and continuous space. Via the interaction of curvatures, we can build proper connections for a graph and the embedding space to obtain high-quality representations, which is a promising direction to advance geometric learning. In the future, we will consider the use of Ricci flow, a more sophisticated geometric concept derived from Ricci curvature, to further enhance graph embedding and graph machine learning in tree-likeness modeling.<h2>publication_ref</h2>[]<h2>figure_ref</h2>[]<h2>table_ref</h2>[]<h2>heading</h2>APPENDIX A DATASETS<h2>text</h2>In this section, we provide details about the datasets used in our study. The Disease dataset contains nodes that are labeled as infected or not infected with a disease, with features indicating their susceptibility to the disease. The disease-spreading network in this dataset displays a clear hierarchical structure, which makes it ideal for testing the effectiveness of hyperbolic embedding models. We use this dataset to validate our proposal. The Airport dataset consists of nodes representing airports, with edges indicating the existence of routes between two airports and labels reflecting the population of the respective country that the airport belongs to. In contrast, the PubMed and Cora datasets represent scientific papers as nodes, with edges indicating citations and labels corresponding to academic subfields.
