While MAP punishes the lower ranked recommendations of relevant segments, MS only considers whether the relevant segments are contained in the set of recommendations. For a single document and a concrete requirement ùëü ùëó the modified sensitivity S(ùêæ) from [16] and the average precision AP(ùêæ) are respectively defined as:\nS(ùêæ) = |top ùêæ recommendations ‚à© ùêø annotations| min(ùêæ, ùêø) ,(1)\nAP(ùêæ) = 1 min(ùêæ, ùêø) ùêæ ‚àëÔ∏Å ùëñ=1 (P(ùëñ) ‚Ä¢ rel(ùëñ)) ,(2)\nwhere ùêø denotes the number of relevant segment annotations, rel(ùëñ) indicates whether the ùëñ th recommendation is relevant (rel(ùëñ) = 1) or not (rel(ùëñ) = 0), and\nP(ùëñ) = |top ùëñ recommendations ‚à© ùêø annotations| ùëñ(3)\nrepresents the precision score considering the top ùëñ recommendations.

For all evaluated models we conduct an exhaustive grid search comparing various parameter combinations based on their validation set MAP(3) performance to determine the best training setup. Table 2 highlights the explored ranges and respective best values of sustain.AI's tuned model parameters. 4 https://github.com/LarsHill/dnk-dataset.  As encoding backbone we employ a BERT BASE model, published by the MDZ Digital Library team (dbmdz) 5 . It mirrors the architectural setup of the English BERT BASE counterpart 6 and is pre-trained on a large corpus of German books, news reports and Wikipedia articles. We train our model and all neural network based baselines via gradient descent utilizing the AdamW [10] optimizer with a linear warmup of 10% and a linearly decaying learning rate schedule. Additionally, we apply weight decay of 0.01 and gradient clipping with a maximum value of 1. We also analyze different learning rates, batch sizes, levels of dropout regularization, and MLP hidden dimensions, as can be seen in Table 2. For all training runs we set a random seed of 42 and fix the maximum number of epochs to 15 while applying early stopping with a patience of 3 epochs.\nDue to the small percentage of annotated segments ùë† in the GRI data set (9%, see Table 1) we employ weighted random sampling (WRS) with replacement to expose these relevant segments more frequently during training. Concretely, we alter the originally uniform sampling probability of each segment to the normalized inverse frequency of relevant + or irrelevantoccurrences in the training set.\nFigure 3 showcases the benefits of integrating WRS into the model training process for the GRI data set. We achieve a much faster training convergence and thus, save a considerable amount of training time and compute power benefitting from early stopping. At the same time, our model's MAP(3) score on the validation set increases by 3 percentage points. </p><h2>publication_ref</h2> <p>['b9'] </p><h2>figure_ref</h2> <p>['fig_2'] </p><h2>table_ref</h2> <p>['tab_1', 'tab_1', 'tab_0'] </p><h2>heading</h2> <p>Baselines </p><h2>text</h2> <p>We compare sustain.AI's end-to-end recommender model from Section 3.3 with 4 competing baseline architectures. For a fair comparison, all baselines make use of weighted random sampling concerning the imbalanced GRI data set.\nFirst, we utilize word frequency-based Tf-Idf [13] representations that have been fitted on our respective training corpora. Prior to training, all segments have been preprocessed in terms of lowercasing, punctuation-and digit removal as well as stemming. The resulting 8000 dimensional segment vectors are then used as input for an ensemble of one-vs-rest binary logistic regression (LR) classifiers.
