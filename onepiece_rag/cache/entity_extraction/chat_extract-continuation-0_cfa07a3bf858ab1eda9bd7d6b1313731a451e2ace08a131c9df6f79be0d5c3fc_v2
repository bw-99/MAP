In the foreseeable future, readers will frequently want to find the source code needed to repeat the experiments when searching for papers of interest on academic search systems, such as Google Scholar and Microsoft Academicfoot_0 . Our new cross-platform recommender system, paper2repo, addresses this need by automatically finding repositories relevant to a paper, even if pointers to the code were not included in the manuscript.\nIn the past few years, cross-platform recommender systems [3,9,29] attracted a lot of attention. Cross-platform recommender systems refer to those that leverage information from multiple different platforms to recommend items for users. Existing work mainly adopts transfer learning to enrich users' preference models with auxiliary information from multiple platforms. For example, Elkahky et al. [3] developed a multi-view deep learning model to jointly learn users' features from their preferred items in different domains of Microsoft service. Such prior work typically uses supervised learning to infer user preferences from their past behavior. In contrast, this paper designs a new item-item cross-platform recommender system, paper2repo, that matches repositories on GitHub to papers in the academic search system, without the benefit of prior access history or explicit labeling. Instead, we use joint embedding to quickly find repositories related to papers of interest, thereby seamlessly connecting Microsoft Academic with GitHub (acquired by Microsoft in June, 2018 2 ).\nA simple candidate solution to our matching problem might be to search for keywords from paper titles in the database of repositories on GitHub. However, it may not recommend sufficiently diverse items to users. For instance, a user who is interested in the textCNN repository 3 may like the Transformer repository 4 as well, because both of them are related to natural language processing. Such a comprehensive set of relevant repositories is hard to infer from paper titles and, in fact, will often not be included in the text of the manuscript either.\nDeep neural networks have recently been used to implement recommender systems. Among the recent advances, a semi-supervised graph convolutional network (GCN) [6,26,27] has been widely used for recommendation because it can exploit both the graph structure and input features together. However, past work applied the approach to single platforms only. Since papers and repositories live on two different platforms, their embeddings generated by traditional GCN are not in the same space. Our contribution lies in extending this approach to joint embedding that bridges the two platforms. The embedding requires constructing appropriate graphs for papers and repositories as inputs to the GCN, as well as selecting the right text features for each. We address these challenges with the following core techniques:\nContext graphs: Relations between papers can be described by a citations graph. Relations between repositories are less obvious. In this paper, we leverage the tags and user starring to connect repositories together. There exists an edge between two repositories if there are overlapped keywords between them, or if they are starred by the same users. In addition, term frequency-inverse document frequency (TF-IDF) [16] is adopted to extract the important tags to construct the repository-repository context graph.\nConstrained GCN model with text encoding. To map the embeddings of papers and repositories to the same space, we develop a joint model that incorporates a text encoding technique into the constrained GCN model based on their contents and graph structures. Since some research papers explicitly name (in the manuscript) their corresponding repositories of source code on GitHub, these papers could be used as bridge papers to connect the two cross platforms. Accordingly, we propose a constrained GCN model to minimize the distance between the embeddings of bridge papers and their original repositories. Moreover, we leverage a text encoding technique with convolutional neural networks (CNN) to encode information from the abstracts of papers, and the descriptions and tags of repositories as input features of the constrained GCN model. As a result, the proposed constrained GCN with text encoding can We conduct experiments to evaluate the performance of the proposed paper2repo system on real-world data sets collected from GitHub and Microsoft Academic. The evaluation results demonstrate that the proposed paper2repo outperforms other compared recommendation methods. It can achieve about 10% higher recommendation accuracy than other methods for the top 10 recommended candidates. To sum up, we make the following contributions to applications, methodology, and experimentation, respectively:\n• Application: We develop a novel item-item cross-platform recommender system, paper2repo, that can automatically recommend repositories on GitHub to a query paper in the academic search system. • Methodology: We propose a joint model that incorporates the text encoding technique into the constrained GCN model to jointly learn and map the embeddings of papers and repositories from two different platforms into the same space. • Experimentation: Evaluation results demonstrate that the proposed paper2repo produces better recommendations than other state of the art methods. The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 presents the motivation, background, and formulation for our paper2repo problem. In Section 3, we introduce the overall architecture of the paper2repo recommender system. Section 4 evaluates its performance on real-world data sets. Section 5 summarizes related work.
