We use the D&C [30] as the specific implementation of file-level IRFL available online [1] , which is a machine learning-based IRFL tool using a similarity matrix of 70-dimension feature vectors (7 features from bug reports and 10 features from source code files): D&C uses multiple classifier models that are trained each for specific groups of bug reports. Given a bug report, the different predictions of the different classifiers are merged to yield a single list of suspicious code files. Our execution of D&C (Line 2 in Algorithm 1) is tractable given that we only need to preprocess those bug reports that we must localize. Trained classifiers are already available. We ensure that no data leakage is induced (i.e., the classifiers are not trained with bug reports that we want to localize in this work). </p><h2>publication_ref</h2> <p>['b40', 'b29', 'b0'] </p><h2>figure_ref</h2> <p>[] </p><h2>table_ref</h2> <p>[] </p><h2>heading</h2> <p>Ranking Suspicious </p><h2>text</h2> <p>Statements. Patch generation requires fine-grained information on code entities that must be changed. For iFixR, we propose to produce a standard output, as for spectrumbased fault localization, to facilitate integration and reuse of stateof-the-art patch generation techniques. To start, we build on the conclusions on a recent large-scale study [47] of bug fixes to limit the search space of suspicious locations to the statements that are more error-prone. After investigating in detail the abstract syntax tree (AST)-based code differences of over 16 000 real-world patches from Java projects, Liu et al. [47] reported that the following specific AST statement nodes were significantly more prone to be faulty than others: IfStatements, ExpressionStatements, FieldDeclarations, ReturnStatements and VariableDeclara-tionStatements. Lines 7-17 in Algorithm 1 detail the process to produce a ranked list of suspicious statements.\nAlgorithm 1 describes the process of our fault localization approach used in iFixR. Top k files are selected among the returned list of suspicious files of the IRFL along with their computed suspiciousness scores. Then each file is parsed to retain only the relevant error-prone statements from which textual tokens are extracted. The summary and descriptions of the bug report are also analyzed  return Sscor e (lexically) to collect all its tokens. Due to the specific nature of stack traces and other code elements which may appear in the bug report, we use regular expressions to detect stack traces and code elements to improve the tokenization process, which is based on punctuations, camel case splitting (e.g., findNumber splits into find, number) as well as snake case splitting (e.g., find_number splits into find, number). Stop word removalfoot_1 is then applied before performing stemming (using the PorterStemmer [24]) on all tokens to create homogeneity with the term's root (i.e., by conflating variants of the same term). Each bag of tokens (for the bug report, and for each statement) is then eventually used to build a feature vector. We use cosine similarity among the vectors to rank the file statements that are relevant to the bug report.\nGiven that we considered k files, the statements of each having their own similarity score with respect to the bug report, we weight these scores with the suspiciousness score of the associated file. Eventually, we sort the statements using the weighted scores and produce a ranked list of code locations (i.e., statements in files) to be recommended as candidate fault locations. </p><h2>publication_ref</h2> <p>['b46', 'b46', 'b23'] </p><h2>figure_ref</h2> <p>[] </p><h2>table_ref</h2> <p>[] </p><h2>heading</h2> <p>Fix Pattern-based Patch Generation </p><h2>text</h2> <p>A common, and reliable, strategy in automatic program repair is to generate concrete patches based on fix patterns [26] (also referred to as fix templates [51] or program transformation schemas [18]). Several APR systems [14,18,26,31,46,48,49,51,60,73] in the literature implement this strategy by using diverse sets of fix patterns obtained either via manual generation or automatic mining of bug fix datasets. In this work, we consider the pioneer PAR system by Kim et al. [26]. Concretely, we build on kPAR [48], an open-source Java implementation of PAR in which we included a diverse set of fix patterns collected from the literature. Table 4 provides an enumeration of fix patterns used in this work. For more implementation details, we refer the reader to our replication package. All tools and data are released as open source to the community to foster further research into these directions. As illustrated in Figure 3, a fix pattern encodes the recipe of change actions that should be applied to mutate a code element.  For a given reported bug, once our fault localizer yields its list of suspicious statements, iFixR iteratively attempts to select fix patterns for each statement. The selection of fix patterns is conducted in a na√Øve way based on the context information of each suspicious statement (i.e., all nodes in its abstract syntax tree, AST). Specifically, iFixR parses the code and traverses each node of the suspicious statement AST from its first child node to its last leaf node in a breadth-first strategy (i.e, left-to-right and\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>D&C<|>concept<|>D&C is a machine learning-based tool for file-level IRFL that utilizes a similarity matrix of 70-dimension feature vectors derived from bug reports and source code files to identify suspicious code files related to bug reports.)\n(\"entity\"<|>IRFL<|>concept<|>IRFL stands for Interactive Repair Fault Localization, a process that helps in identifying the locations in code that are likely to contain faults based on bug reports.)\n(\"entity\"<|>CLASSIFIER MODELS<|>concept<|>Classifier models are machine learning models trained to predict specific outcomes, in this case, to identify suspicious code files based on bug reports.)\n(\"entity\"<|>BUG REPORTS<|>concept<|>Bug reports are documents that describe issues or defects in software, which are used as input for the D&C tool to localize faults.)\n(\"entity\"<|>SUSPICIOUS CODE FILES<|>concept<|>Suspicious code files are files identified by the D&C tool as potentially containing faults based on the analysis of bug reports.)\n(\"entity\"<|>ALGORITHM 1<|>concept<|>Algorithm 1 describes the process of the fault localization approach used in iFixR, detailing how suspicious statements are ranked and selected.)\n(\"entity\"<|>iFixR<|>concept<|>iFixR is a fault localization tool that generates ranked lists of suspicious statements in code based on bug reports and applies fix patterns to address these issues.)\n(\"entity\"<|>ABSTRACT SYNTAX TREE (AST)<|>concept<|>The abstract syntax tree (AST) is a data structure that represents the hierarchical structure of source code, used in the analysis of code differences and fault localization.)\n(\"entity\"<|>FIX PATTERNS<|>concept<|>Fix patterns are predefined templates or schemas used in automatic program repair to generate patches for identified faults in code.)\n(\"entity\"<|>COSINE SIMILARITY<|>concept<|>Cosine similarity is a metric used to measure the similarity between two vectors, applied here to rank file statements relevant to bug reports.)\n(\"relationship\"<|>D&C<|>IRFL<|>D&C is a specific implementation of an interactive repair fault localization tool that utilizes machine learning techniques to analyze bug reports<|>8)\n(\"relationship\"<|>D&C<|>CLASSIFIER MODELS<|>D&C employs multiple classifier models trained to predict suspicious code files based on different groups of bug reports<|>7)\n(\"relationship\"<|>BUG REPORTS<|>SUSPICIOUS CODE FILES<|>Bug reports are analyzed by D&C to identify suspicious code files that may contain faults<|>8)\n(\"relationship\"<|>ALGORITHM 1<|>iFixR<|>Algorithm 1 outlines the fault localization process implemented in iFixR, detailing how suspicious statements are ranked<|>9)\n(\"relationship\"<|>iFixR<|>FIX PATTERNS<|>iFixR uses fix patterns to generate patches for the suspicious statements identified during fault localization<|>8)\n(\"relationship\"<|>ABSTRACT SYNTAX TREE (AST)<|>iFixR<|>iFixR analyzes the abstract syntax tree of suspicious statements to determine the context for applying fix patterns<|>7)\n(\"relationship\"<|>COSINE SIMILARITY<|>SUSPICIOUS CODE FILES<|>Cosine similarity is used to rank the suspicious code files based on their relevance to the bug reports<|>6) \n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
