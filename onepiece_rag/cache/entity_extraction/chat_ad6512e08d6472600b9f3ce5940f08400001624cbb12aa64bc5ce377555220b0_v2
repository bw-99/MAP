One key aspect of residents' daily comfort is assured through affording reliable traffic management and route planning. Comprehensively, the majority of the present trip planning applications and service providers are enabling their trip planning recommendations relying on shortest paths and/or fastest routes. However, such suggestions may discount drivers' preferences with respect to safe and less disturbing trips. Road anomalies such as cracks, potholes, and manholes induce risky driving scenarios and can lead to vehicles damages and costly repairs. Accordingly, in this paper, we propose a crowdsensing based dynamic route planning system. Leveraging both the vehicle motion sensors and the inertial sensors within the smart devices, road surface types and anomalies have been detected and categorized. In addition, the monitored events are geo-referenced utilizing GPS receivers on both vehicles and smart devices. Consequently, road segments assessments are conducted using fuzzy system models based on aspects such as the number of anomalies and their severity levels in each road segment. Afterward, another fuzzy model is adopted to recommend the best trip routes based on the road segments quality in each potential route. Extensive road experiments are held to build and show the potential of the proposed system. </p><h1>sections</h1><h2>heading</h2> <p>I. INTRODUCTION </p><h2>text</h2> <p>Smart Cities, by 2024, are predicted to generate $2.3 trillion according to CISCO [1]. Meanwhile, there are various smart applications and services present in multiple sectors spanning environment, health, waste management and transportation [2,3]. Nevertheless, further insights, evaluations, and improvements are necessary for granting adequate performance of smart cities. Mainly, smart transportation and traffic management are highly needed as one can say they broadly influence almost every aspect of the smart cities operation on daily bases [4]. In particular, trip route planning receives great interest particularly in big and crowded cities [4,5]. Principally, trip planning applications and service providers afford route recommendations based on relatively shorter paths, traffic congestion and even with up to date construction works [6].\nConsequently, some of the route planning key players as Google have adopted online dynamic routing driven by live traffic network information. For example, Google maps provide an online suggestion for vehicle re-routing when roads are experiencing instantaneous traffic congestion based on many factors such as untraditional mobility behavior or accidents. On the other hand, corwdsensed based trip planning application Waze [7] relies on lively sensed traffic situations which shared with the users' intervention. APOLO [8] system was introduced to overcome the network overload introduced in many of the traffic management systems because of information exchange between vehicles and servers. This system proposed a centralized traffic monitoring system that works on both online and offline bases. In the offline stage, mobility patterns are conducted by historical data processing while in the online stage vehicles are re-routed away from the congested routes. The results showed travel time reduction of 17 % along with a speed increase of 6% compared to present approaches.\nIn addition, various efforts in the literature provided suggestions to enable shorter and faster routing for land vehicles. In [9], an adaptive routing approach was introduced and dealt with route planning as a probabilistic dynamic problem. In their algorithms, they aimed to reduce the predicted en route trip time while considering broadcasted traffic information, onboard based traffic state measurement, and historical traffic patterns. Moreover, in [10] personal behavior based trip planning was presented to contribute a solution for traffic congestion problem. The authors assumed and discussed that the driving preferences changes from a driver to another could be handled in a way to create drivers' profiles which are used in their route planning leading to less traffic congestion. Furthermore, in [6] an extended version of [10] specified three significant aspects of personal based route planning. These significant considerations are the road safety regarding the presence of snow or black ice, traffic speed and congestion level. The contributions of these factors are assessed based on fuzzy inference engine while the overall optimum routing was enabled by an optimization problem. In [11] a dynamic route planning system was proposed to include future traffic hazards in vehicle routing. This system contained three components which are real-time data streamed from the vehicles plus data collected by automatic traffic loops sensors and the third component used both data sources to predict future traffic conditions through Spatio-Temporal random field process.\nIn order to assure relaxing trips, in [12] a system was introduced to reduce the routes distances along with providing suggestions for routes with high-quality sceneries. A memetic algorithm was used to provide skyline scenic trip planning while maintaining low travel distances. On the other hand, to ensure drivers and travelers safety, a system was proposed in [13] to enable route planning while discarding routes that encounter high crime rate. Based on crime data provided by Chicago and Philadelphia a risk model was introduced for the cities urban networks.\nThe highlighted literature showed significant efforts in enriching efficient route planning regarding suggesting shortest paths, fewer traffic routes and considering personal preferences as well. However, road quality information is the crucial aspect that enables drivers safe and comfort trips was not considered in the most of route planning systems [14]. Deteriorated road surface conditions can lead to vehicle damage and dangerous driving scenarios that result in drivers' frustration and stress [14,15]. Consequently, existing land vehicles are considered mobile sensor hubs with various sensing and communications capabilities [16]. Vehicle motion sensors in the land vehicles along with the inertial sensors embedded in the drivers' smart devices enabled adequate detection for various road surface types and anomalies. Thanks to both GPS receivers and inertial sensors the detected anomalies are robustly geo-referenced [17,18].\nIn this paper, we present iDriveSense a corwds\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}}
