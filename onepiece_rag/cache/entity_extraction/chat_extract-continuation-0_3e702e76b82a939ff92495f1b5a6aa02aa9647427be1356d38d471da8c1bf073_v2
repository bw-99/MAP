Blackburn and Gerke [2] prove that if K n ‚â• 2 and P n = ‚åän Œæ ‚åã, where Œæ is a positive constant, G(n, K n , P n ) is a.a.s. connected (resp., not connected) if lim inf n‚Üí+‚àû\nK 2 n n Pn ln n > 1 (resp., lim sup n‚Üí+‚àû K 2 n n\nPn ln n < 1). Yagan and Makowski [39] demonstrate that iffoot_0 K n ‚â• 2, P n = ‚Ñ¶(n) and\nK 2 n Pn = ln n+Œ±n n , then G(n, K n , P n ) is a.a.s. connected (resp., not connected) if lim n‚Üí‚àû Œ± n = +‚àû (resp., lim n‚Üí‚àû Œ± n = -‚àû).\nRybarczyk [32] obtains a stronger result without requiring P n = ‚Ñ¶(n). In particular, she derives the asymptotically exact probability of connectivity in G(n, K n , P n ) as follows: under K n ‚â• 2, if the sequence Œ± n defined through\nK 2 n Pn = ln n+Œ±n n has a limit Œ± * ‚àà [-‚àû, ‚àû], then the probability of G(n, K n , P n ) being connected approaches to e -e -Œ± *\nas n ‚Üí ‚àû. This asymptotically exact probability result is stronger than a zeroone law since the latter can be obtained by setting Œ± * as ‚àû and -‚àû in the former. Rybarczyk also establishes [33, Remark 1, p. 5] a zero-one law for k-connectivity in G(n, K n , P n ) by showing the similarity between G(n, K n , P n ) and a random intersection graph [5] via a coupling argument. Specifically, she proves that if P n = Œò(n Œæ ) for some Œæ > 1 and\nK 2 n Pn = ln n+(k-1) ln ln n+Œ±n n , then the G(n, K n , P n ) is a.a.s. k-connected (resp., not k-connected) if lim n‚Üí‚àû Œ± n = +‚àû (resp., lim n‚Üí‚àû Œ± n = -‚àû).\nRecently Yagan [37] gives a zero-one law for connectivity (i.e., 1-connectivity) in graph G(n, K n , P n )‚à©G(n, p n ), which is the intersection of random key graph G(n, K n , P n ) and random graph G(n, p n ), and clearly is equivalent to our key graph G on ; see Section III. Specifically, he proves that if\nK n ‚â• 2, P n = ‚Ñ¶(n) and p n ‚Ä¢ 1 - ( Pn -Kn Kn ) ( Pn Kn )\n‚àº c ln n n hold, and lim n‚Üí‚àû (p n ln n) exists, then graph G(n, K n , P n ) ‚à© G(n, p n ) is asymptotically almost surely connected (resp., not connected) if c > 1 (resp., c < 1). A comparison of our results with the related work is given in Section IV-D.\nAfter the submission of this paper, we have derived the asymptotically exact probability of k-connectivity in G(n, K n , P n ) [45] (resp., G on [44]). Based on the proofs in this paper, we show i) that [45] under P n = ‚Ñ¶(n), if the sequence Œ± n defined through\nK 2 n Pn = ln n+(k-1) ln ln n+Œ±n n has a limit Œ± * ‚àà [-‚àû, ‚àû], then the probability of G(n, K n , P n ) being k-connected converges to e -e -Œ± *\n(k-1)! as n ‚Üí ‚àû, and ii) that [44] under P n = ‚Ñ¶(n) and Kn Pn = o(1), if the sequence\nŒ± n defined through p n ‚Ä¢ 1 - ( Pn -Kn Kn ) ( Pn Kn ) = ln n+(k-1) ln ln n+Œ±n n has a limit Œ± * ‚àà [-‚àû, ‚àû],\nthen the probability of G on being k-connected converges to e -e -Œ± * (k-1)! as n ‚Üí ‚àû. </p><h2>publication_ref</h2> <p>['b10', 'b15', 'b10', 'b11', 'b29', 'b1', 'b31', 'b38', 'b1', 'b38', 'b31', 'b4', 'b36', 'b44', 'b43', 'b44', 'b43'] </p><h2>figure_ref</h2> <p>[] </p><h2>table_ref</h2> <p>[] </p><h2>heading</h2> <p>III.
