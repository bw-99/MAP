These two metrics are visualized in iQUANT to aid the interactive factor selection and stock portfolio construction process.\n• Sensitivity: a metric that indicates whether the utilization of a factor can be replaced by other factors. The sensitivity is computed by (ξ i jξ i ) + where ξ i j denotes the prediction error by removing the jth factor from sparse regression models, ξ i denotes the prediction error of the original model; • Stability: a good factor for the predictive model should have stable contributions in a long period of time before confidently applied. Quantitatively, it is measured by the number of times the factor's contribution to a stock's prediction flips from negative to positive or from positive to negative. </p><h2>publication_ref</h2> <p>['b15'] </p><h2>figure_ref</h2> <p>[] </p><h2>table_ref</h2> <p>[] </p><h2>heading</h2> <p>Visualization </p><h2>text</h2> <p> </p><h2>publication_ref</h2> <p>[] </p><h2>figure_ref</h2> <p>[] </p><h2>table_ref</h2> <p>[] </p><h2>heading</h2> <p>Control Panel </p><h2>text</h2> <p>The control panel in Figure 2(a) allows users to select an initial pool of stocks for analysis (T1). S/he can input the stock code to select an individual stock or choose an entire sector of stocks from a sector list. All the selected stocks will appear in the bottom part of the control panel, aggregated by sectors. Next, users need to specify a time period and a model for factor investing. Finally, users click the \"Draw\" button to visualize factors related to the selected stocks. </p><h2>publication_ref</h2> <p>[] </p><h2>figure_ref</h2> <p>['fig_2'] </p><h2>table_ref</h2> <p>[] </p><h2>heading</h2> <p>Factor View </p><h2>text</h2> <p>Factor view (Figure 2 To meet the above design requirements, we propose a customized visual design to integrate time-varying factor importance metrics in a single factor view. As shown in Figure 2(b), the x-axis of the view indicates a timeline divided into multiple time units (months by default). Each factor is visualized as a series of filled circles in these time units. On each circle, the color hue encodes factor type, the color opacity encodes the factor sensitivity to the model, and the circle radius represents the aggregated factor importance to all the selected stocks. Three importance metrics can be displayed by the checkboxes in the top row of the factor view: weight, value, and contribution (default). All the circles on the same time unit are vertically aligned by a fixed order of their corresponding factors to facilitate factor tracking and comparison along the timeline. As each factor can have a positive or negative contribution in different time units, we depict positive and negative factors as circles above and below the x-axis respectively.\nUser interactions are designed in the factor view to help identify useful factors for modeling. When a user hovers a factor circle, all the circles representing the same factor are linked by a curved line to reveal its stability over time. (Figure 2(b)). Also, a tooltip will be displayed, showing the detailed information of the factor circle such as factor type, name, sensitivity and importance metric. The user can interactively filter factors to reduce visual complexity.\nAlternative designs of the factor view have been considered. The line chart is the most intuitive form to visualize factor importance over time. When we have as many as 56 factors, line charts suffer from severe visual clutter. Stacked flow chart [BW08] is another possible visual design. A quick overview of factor composition can be provided, but it is not good at displaying the temporal dynamics of individual factors (especially for unimportant factors). For the circle layout, we also experimented with circle packing in which positive and negative factors are placed separately. The circle packing leads to more compact visualization (Figure 3(a)). However, our domain experts complained that the design made it difficult to track individual factors across the timeline. The relative position of the same factor circle varied a lot across different time units. In an improved layered circle packing (Figure 3(b)), which is similar to a matrix design, the same type of factors is aligned horizontally. It facilitates tracking of the same factor, but the space usage is inefficient and the connecting lines on factors lead to heavy crossings. The current design is a good trade-off between space usage and effectiveness compared with other alternative designs. </p><h2>publication_ref</h2> <p>[] </p><h2>figure_ref</h2> <p>['fig_2', 'fig_2', 'fig_2', 'fig_4', 'fig_4'] </p><h2>table_ref</h2> <p>[] </p><h2>heading</h2> <p>Stock View </p><h2>text</h2> <p>Stock view (Figure 2(c)) splits the aggregated factor time series in the factor view according to their importance to individual stocks.
