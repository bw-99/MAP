First, in view of ( 9) and the condition lim n→∞ α n = -∞, we obtain p e ≤ ln n+(k-1) ln ln n n for all n sufficiently large. Thus, p e = o 1\n√ n , and we use Lemma 2 to get\nnP [D x,ℓ ] ∼ n • (ℓ!) -1 (p e n) ℓ e -pen(61)\nfor each ℓ = 0, 1, . . .. The proof will be given in two steps. First, in the case where there exists an ǫ > 0 such that p e n > ǫ for all n sufficiently large, we will establish (51) and ( 53) for ℓ = k -1. Next, for the case where lim n→∞ p e n = 0, we will show that (51) and (53) hold for ℓ = 0. Assume now that p e n > ǫ > 0 for all n sufficiently large. Substituting ( 9) into (61) with ℓ = k -1, we get\nnP [D x,k-1 ](62)\n∼ n • [(k -1)!] -1 (p e n) k-1 e -ln n-(k-1) ln ln n-αn = [(k -1)!] -1 × (ln n + (k -1) ln ln n + α n ) k-1 e -(k-1) ln ln n-αn . Let f n (k; α n ) := (ln n + (k -1) ln ln n + α n ) k-1 e -(k-1) ln ln n-αn ,\nand observe that we have ln n + (k -1) ln ln n + α n ≥ ǫ for all n sufficiently large since p e n > ǫ. On that range, fix n, pick 0 < γ < 1 and consider the cases α n ≤ -(1γ) ln n and α n > -(1γ) ln n. In the former case, we have\nf n (k; α n ) ≥ ǫ • e -(k-1) ln ln n+(1-γ) ln n ,\nwhereas in the latter we obtain\nf n (k; α n ) ≥ (γ ln n) k-1 e -(k-1) ln ln n-αn = γ k-1 e -αn .\nThus, for all n sufficiently large, we have\nf n (k; α n ) ≥ min ǫ • e -(k-1) ln ln n+(1-γ) ln n , γ k-1 e -αn .\nIt is now easy to see that lim n→∞ f n (k; α n ) = ∞ since 0 < γ < 1 and lim n→∞ α n = -∞. Substituting this into (62), we obtain (51) with ℓ = k -1. In addition, from (54) of Lemma 2, and (55) of Lemma 3, it is clear that (53) follows with ℓ = k -1. As mentioned already, (51) and ( 53) imply ( 47) and (48) in view of Lemma 1, and the zero-law ( 11) is now established for the case when p e n > ǫ > 0.\nWe now turn to the case where lim n→∞ p e n = p ⋆ e = 0. This time, we let ℓ = 0 in (61) and obtain\nnP [D x,0 ] ∼ ne -pen ∼ n.\nWe clearly have (51) for ℓ = 0. Also, from (54) of Lemma 2 with ℓ = 0, and (56) of Lemma 3, we obtain (53) for ℓ = 0. Having obtained (51) and ( 53) for ℓ = 0, we get (47) and ( 48) and the zero-law ( 11) is now established from Fact 1 (c).<h2>publication_ref</h2>['b45']<h2>figure_ref</h2>[]<h2>table_ref</h2>[]<h2>heading</h2>VII. A PROOF OF PROPOSITION 1<h2>text</h2>We start by noting that D x,ℓ ∩ D y,ℓ ∩ E xy stands for the event that nodes v x and v y both have ℓ neighbors but are not neighbors with each other. To compute its probability, we specify all the possible cardinalities of sets N xy , N xy and N xy , defined in Section V-D. To this end, we define the series of events A h in the following manner\nA h = [|N xy | = h] [|N xy | = ℓ -h] [|N xy | = ℓ -h] (63)\nfor each h = 0, 1, . . . , ℓ; here, |S| denotes the cardinality of the discrete set S.\nIt is now a simple matter to check that\nD x,ℓ ∩ D y,ℓ ∩ E xy = ℓ h=0 A h ∩ E xy .
