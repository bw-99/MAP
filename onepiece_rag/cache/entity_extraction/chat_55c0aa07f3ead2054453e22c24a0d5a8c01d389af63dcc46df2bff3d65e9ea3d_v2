In the first stage, the system takes three types of stock market data. The first type is stock transaction data, notably the stock daily opening/closing prices. The second type is market information, including but not limited to financial statements (total assets, debts, cash flows, etc.), market news, and financial reports. The third and most critical part of data are factors computed from stock transactions and market information, which is used in our system for user selection and model building. In this application, we apply data from a major stock market consisting of 3,000 stocks during 30 years (1990-2018). The data is collected from both external sources (e.g., open APIs for transaction data) or by internal computations (e.g., financial factors). The underlying technique of our system can be easily extended to support other stock markets.\nIn the second stage of Figure 1, we integrate a sparse regression model to carry out factor selection and return prediction simultaneously. The performance of selected factors and predictive models are visualized in iQUANT . The result of interactive factor investing is evaluated in a standard backtesting view in the final stage.\nThe iQUANT system is a web-based full-stack application. All data are stored in MongoDB. The front-ends use Vue.js and D3.js libraries. The sparse regression model is time-consuming. However, it only takes ‚àº20 seconds in the back-end to compute a sector (dozen) of stocks and respond to the web browser. All performance is measured in a laptop requesting a four-CPU cloud server. We expect to upgrade the server to further reduce computation time. </p><h2>publication_ref</h2> <p>[] </p><h2>figure_ref</h2> <p>['fig_1', 'fig_1'] </p><h2>table_ref</h2> <p>[] </p><h2>heading</h2> <p>Predictive Analytics </p><h2>text</h2> <p> </p><h2>publication_ref</h2> <p>[] </p><h2>figure_ref</h2> <p>[] </p><h2>table_ref</h2> <p>[] </p><h2>heading</h2> <p>Sparse Regression Model </p><h2>text</h2> <p>The interactive factor investing approach takes two steps to make final decisions on portfolio adjustment. First, the collection of financial factors are used to build models on the pool of candidate stocks for investment. Second, traders evaluate the predicted stock returns by the model and decide on the portfolio adjustment. In iQUANT, the second step is achieved by user interactions with the interface to understand the model output, and using existing trading strategies/algorithms (beyond the scope of this paper). In this part, we describe a suite of sparse regression models applied in the first step to jointly recommend factors (i.e. feature selection) and predict stock returns (i.e., model optimization). The sparse regression model is a popularly-used one in industry. Users can replace it with other statistics/machine learning models with similar output format. We include the sparse regression model to demonstrate the workflow of iQUANT.\nConsider the model for a stock œí during a time period of Œì = [T + 1, T + L], where L is the length of Œì and any time t ‚àà Œì indicates the tth trading day.
