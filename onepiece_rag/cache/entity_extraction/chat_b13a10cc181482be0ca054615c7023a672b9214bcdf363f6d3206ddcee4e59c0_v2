Embedding Table Mapping<h2>text</h2>The iMARS architecture uses CMAs to store ETs., which have varying number of entries (typically 3-30,000 entries). Each row on the CMA represents an entry of an ET. Designing CMAs with varying sizes is not practical. We determined the optimal array-level CMA to be the size of 256 × 256 based on circuit-level simulations. Some of the ETs can fit in a single CMA and some require multiple CMAs. The number of CMAs needed to store an ET is n/R where n is the number of entries in the ET and R is the number of rows in the CMA. If n/R < C, we only need one mat, otherwise the number of mats needed to be activated is equal to n/(RC). Each sparse feature is mapped to a separate bank. Hence, the number of activated banks depends on the number of sparse features.\nWe quantize all ETs to 8-bit integer precision to reduce the memory requirement. We also replace the cosine-distance based NNS in the original filtering stage with the IMC-friendly Hamming-distance based NNS. To facilitate the Hamming distance search, we employ a locality-sensitive hashing (LSH) technique on the ItET [5]. Each row of the ItET includes the additional bits for storing the corresponding LSH values. Finally, a fixed-radius near neighbor search instead of top-k search is employed. The fixed-radius near neighbor search is amenable to the threshold-based match offered by the TCAM implementation, and reduces the total number of required operations. Algorithm-level evaluation will be presented in Sec. IV to study the effects of the adjustment on accuracy. We use a 256 LSH signature length which requires 2 CMAs to store a single entry.<h2>publication_ref</h2>['b4']<h2>figure_ref</h2>[]<h2>table_ref</h2>[]<h2>heading</h2>C. RecSys Operation Mapping<h2>text</h2>Given the iMARS architecture, careful mapping of the computation, how in Fig. 1 to iMARS is required in order to design the control sequence properly. The crossbars stored the trained weights of the DNN stack and the ItETs and UIETs store the trained ETs for the sparse feature vectors. Fig. 3 illustrates such a mapping where the labels (1a)-(2d*) indicates. We first discuss the operations in the filtering stage. (1a) The sparse features are sent to the corresponding ETs, i.e., UIETs and ItET for lookups and pooling. The embedding vectors of the features are obtained by looking up the stored ETs in the ItET CMAs and UIET CMAs using the RAM mode of the CMA. The retrieved embeddings are then aggregated (indicated by (1b*) in Fig. 3) by the in-memory adder, intramat and intra-bank adder trees. (1b) the dense features are sent to the pre-trained filtering sparse feature DNN stack which is implemented with the crossbar arrays. (1c) All features are then sent to the filtering DNN. The output of the filtering DNN is a user embedding vector (u i in Fig. 3). (1d) The user embedding vector is then sent to the ItET to retrieve the N nearest neighbors as candidate items inside the ItET CMAs. The indices of these retrieved (i.e., candidate) item embeddings are then stored in the item buffer (See (1d*) inf Fig. 3).\nWe now discuss the operations in the ranking stage. (2a) Each candidate item in the item buffer is then analyzed by the next steps with respect to the user's preferences. (2b) By using the item indices in the item buffer, their corresponding item embeddings are retrieved from the stored ET in the ItET and the ranking embeddings are retrieved in the stored ET in the ranking UIETs using the RAM mode. Note that some UIETs used in the filtering mode can be shared with the ranking stage. The item embeddings are pooled with the ranking embeddings either by concatenation or by an ADD operation using the in-memory adder, intra-bank and interbank adder trees. (See (2b*) in Fig. 3) The output forms a new set of embedding features. Together with the dense features are fed to the ranking DNN stack implemented in crossbars. (2c) the dense features are again obtained from the trained ranking DNN stack. (2d) The remaining crossbar arrays implement the ranking DNN with the pooled feature embeddings as input and return the click-through-rate (CTR) to the CTR buffer. The CTR buffer is a CMA that stores the CTR for each candidate item and the item index which are used for selecting the final top-k items. (2e) The CTR buffer then performs a topk operation using the threshold match mode of the CMA by searching a vector of all 1's (the maximum allowable CMA input).<h2>publication_ref</h2>[]<h2>figure_ref</h2>['fig\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4-turbo-preview", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}}
