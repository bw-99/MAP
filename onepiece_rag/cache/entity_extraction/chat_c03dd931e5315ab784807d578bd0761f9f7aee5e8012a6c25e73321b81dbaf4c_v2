Theorem 4.2 (Embedding Distance w.r.t ORC). Let (ùëñ, ùëó) ‚àà ùê∏ be the linked pair, h ùëñ , h ùëó ‚àà R ùëë be the node state in the tangent space, ùëë ùëñ be the degree of node ùëñ, and ùê∑ be the distance of node ùëñ and node ùëó in the tangent space, that is\nùê∑ = ‚à•h ùëñ -h ùëó ‚à•,(12)\nwhere ‚à• ‚Ä¢ ‚à• is the Euclidean norm. Define a large ORC as Œ∫ùëñ,ùëó > max1/ùëë ùëñ , 1/ùëë ùëó  and a small ORC as Œ∫ùëñ,ùëó < min1/ùëë ùëñ , 1/ùëë ùëó . Then, when the large ORC is involved, their embedding distance will get smaller if using ùúÖHGCN. On the contrary, when the small ORC is involved, their embedding distance will get larger.\nProof. In the following, we use ùê∑ ùëô and ùê∑ ùë† to denote the distance when large and small curvature Œ∫ are involved, respectively. The main idea is that when there is a large curvature involved, the node distance will be decreased compared with the original case (degreebased aggregation), that is ùê∑ ùëô < ùê∑. At the same time, when there is a small curvature involved, the node distance will increase, that is ùê∑ ùë† > ùê∑.\n(1) When a large curvature (i.e., ùúÖ ùëñ,ùëó > max(1/ùëë ùëñ , 1/ùëë ùëó )) is involved, more messages will be transferred, and we decompose the embedding, taking h ùëñ as an example, into two components: one is from original h ùëñ and another is the incremental parts from h ùëó , then\nùê∑ ùëô = ‚à•(h ùëñ + ùõº ùëñ h ùëó ) -(h ùëó + ùõº ùëó h ùëñ )‚à• = ‚à•(h ùëñ -ùõº ùëó h ùëñ ) -(h ùëó -ùõº ùëñ h ùëó )‚à•,(13)\nwhere ùõº ùëñ (ùõº ùëó ) is the difference between Œ∫ùëñ,ùëó and 1/ùëë ùëñ ( 1/ùëë ùëó ), i.e., ùõº ùëñ = Œ∫ùëñ,ùëó -1/ùëë ùëñ , ùõº ùëó = Œ∫ùëñ,ùëó -1/ùëë ùëó . Since Œ∫ùëñ,ùëó > max(1/ùëë ùëñ , 1/ùëë ùëó ), ùõº ùëñ and ùõº ùëó are both positive. Let ùõº ùëñ ùëó = ùõº ùëñ ‚âà ùõº ùëó , then\nùê∑ ùëô ‚âà ‚à•(h ùëñ -ùõº ùëñ ùëó h ùëñ ) -(h ùëó -ùõº ùëñ ùëó h ùëó )‚à• = (1 -ùõº ùëñ ùëó )‚à•h ùëñ -h ùëó ‚à• < ùê∑.(14)\nThen, we easily know that when large curvature is involved, the distance will be reduced and two nodes will be closer to each other. What's more, the larger the curvature, the closer the nodes are.\n(2) Similarly, when a small curvature (ùúÖ ùëñ,ùëó < min(1/ùëë ùëñ , 1/ùëë ùëó )) is involved, fewer messages will be transferred, and we decompose the embedding, taking h ùëñ as an example, into two components: one is from original h ùëñ and another is the reduction parts of h ùëó , that is\nùê∑ ùë† = ‚à•(h ùëñ -ùõΩ ùëñ h ùëó ) -(h ùëó -ùõΩ ùëó h ùëñ )‚à• ‚âà (1 + ùõΩ ùëñ ùëó )‚à•h ùëñ -h ùëó ‚à• > ùê∑,(15)\nwhere ùõΩ ùëñ is the difference between 1/ùëë ùëñ and Œ∫ùëñ,ùëó , i.e., ùõΩ ùëñ = 1/ùëë ùëñ -Œ∫ùëñ,ùëó , ùõΩ ùëó = 1/ùëë ùëó -Œ∫ùëñ,ùëó . Both ùõΩ ùëñ and ùõΩ ùëó are positive in that ùúÖ ùëñ,ùëó < min(1/ÔøΩ\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}}
