Define a large ORC as κ𝑖,𝑗 > max{1/𝑑 𝑖 , 1/𝑑 𝑗 } and a small ORC as κ𝑖,𝑗 < min{1/𝑑 𝑖 , 1/𝑑 𝑗 }. Then, when the large ORC is involved, their embedding distance will get smaller if using 𝜅HGCN. On the contrary, when the small ORC is involved, their embedding distance will get larger.\nProof. In the following, we use 𝐷 𝑙 and 𝐷 𝑠 to denote the distance when large and small curvature κ are involved, respectively. The main idea is that when there is a large curvature involved, the node distance will be decreased compared with the original case (degreebased aggregation), that is 𝐷 𝑙 < 𝐷. At the same time, when there is a small curvature involved, the node distance will increase, that is 𝐷 𝑠 > 𝐷.\n(1) When a large curvature (i.e., 𝜅 𝑖,𝑗 > max(1/𝑑 𝑖 , 1/𝑑 𝑗 )) is involved, more messages will be transferred, and we decompose the embedding, taking h 𝑖 as an example, into two components: one is from original h 𝑖 and another is the incremental parts from h 𝑗 , then\n𝐷 𝑙 = ∥(h 𝑖 + 𝛼 𝑖 h 𝑗 ) -(h 𝑗 + 𝛼 𝑗 h 𝑖 )∥ = ∥(h 𝑖 -𝛼 𝑗 h 𝑖 ) -(h 𝑗 -𝛼 𝑖 h 𝑗 )∥,(13)\nwhere 𝛼 𝑖 (𝛼 𝑗 ) is the difference between κ𝑖,𝑗 and 1/𝑑 𝑖 ( 1/𝑑 𝑗 ), i.e., 𝛼 𝑖 = κ𝑖,𝑗 -1/𝑑 𝑖 , 𝛼 𝑗 = κ𝑖,𝑗 -1/𝑑 𝑗 . Since κ𝑖,𝑗 > max(1/𝑑 𝑖 , 1/𝑑 𝑗 ), 𝛼 𝑖 and 𝛼 𝑗 are both positive. Let 𝛼 𝑖 𝑗 = 𝛼 𝑖 ≈ 𝛼 𝑗 , then\n𝐷 𝑙 ≈ ∥(h 𝑖 -𝛼 𝑖 𝑗 h 𝑖 ) -(h 𝑗 -𝛼 𝑖 𝑗 h 𝑗 )∥ = (1 -𝛼 𝑖 𝑗 )∥h 𝑖 -h 𝑗 ∥ < 𝐷.(14)\nThen, we easily know that when large curvature is involved, the distance will be reduced and two nodes will be closer to each other. What's more, the larger the curvature, the closer the nodes are.\n(2) Similarly, when a small curvature (𝜅 𝑖,𝑗 < min(1/𝑑 𝑖 , 1/𝑑 𝑗 )) is involved, fewer messages will be transferred, and we decompose the embedding, taking h 𝑖 as an example, into two components: one is from original h 𝑖 and another is the reduction parts of h 𝑗 , that is\n𝐷 𝑠 = ∥(h 𝑖 -𝛽 𝑖 h 𝑗 ) -(h 𝑗 -𝛽 𝑗 h 𝑖 )∥ ≈ (1 + 𝛽 𝑖 𝑗 )∥h 𝑖 -h 𝑗 ∥ > 𝐷,(15)\nwhere 𝛽 𝑖 is the difference between 1/𝑑 𝑖 and κ𝑖,𝑗 , i.e., 𝛽 𝑖 = 1/𝑑 𝑖 -κ𝑖,𝑗 , 𝛽 𝑗 = 1/𝑑 𝑗 -κ𝑖,𝑗 . Both 𝛽 𝑖 and 𝛽 𝑗 are positive in that 𝜅 𝑖,𝑗 < min(1/𝑑 𝑖 , 1/𝑑 𝑗 ). Let 𝛽 𝑖 𝑗 = 𝛽 𝑖 ≈ 𝛽 𝑗 , then, we easily know that when small curvature is involved, the node pair will become more distant in the embedding space. What's more, the smaller the curvature, the more distant the nodes are. □<h2>publication_ref</h2>['b93', 'b78', 'b32', 'b32']<h2>figure_ref</h2>[]<h2>table_ref</h2>[]<h2>heading</h2>Curvature-based Homophily Constraint<h2\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}}
