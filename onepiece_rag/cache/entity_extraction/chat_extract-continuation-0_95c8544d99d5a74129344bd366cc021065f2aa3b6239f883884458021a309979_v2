More specifically, we will also analyze the capacity augmentation factors of these tests for global RM and global DM in Corollaries 3 and 4, respectively.\nTheorem 8. Let U max k be max k j=1 U j . Task τ k in a sporadic task system with implicit deadlines is schedulable by global RM on M processors if\nU max k ≤ 1 - 2 M k-1 i=1 U i + 0.5 M 2 ( k-1 i=1 U i ) 2 + ( k-1 i=1 U 2 i ) (48) or k-1 j=1 U j M ≤ k -1 k 2 -2 + 2U max k k k -1 .(49)\nProof: We will show that the schedulability condition in the theorem holds for all possible settings of y and ω i s. Suppose that y and ω i for i = 1, 2, . . . , k -1 are given, in which y ≥ 0 and 0 ≤ ω i ≤ T i . Let t k be T k + y. Now, we set t i to ω i + T k +y-ωi Ti T i for i = 1, 2, . . . , k -1 and reindex the tasks such that t 1 ≤ t 2 ≤ . . . ≤ t k . Therefore, if i < j, we know that\nω i • U i + tj -ωi Ti C i ≤ ω i • U i + ( ti-ωi Ti + 1)C i = t i U i + C i . If i ≥ j, then ω i • U i + tj -ωi Ti C i ≤ ω i • U i + ( ti-ωi Ti )C i = t i U i .\nThe sufficient schedulability condition in Lemma 9 under the given y and ω i s is to verify the existence of t j ∈ {t 1 , t 2 , . . . t k } such that\nU max k (T k + y) + k-1 i=1 ω i • U i + tj -ωi Ti C i M (50) ≤U max k t k + k-1 i=1 U i t i + j-1 i=1 C i M ≤ t j .(51)\nBy the definition of global RM scheduling (i.e., T k ≥ T i ), we can conclude that \nC i = U i T i ≤ U i T k ≤ U i (T k +y) = U i t k for i = 1, 2, . . . ,\nU max k t k + k-1 i=1 α i U i t i + j-1 i=1 βU i t k ≤ t j ,(52)\nwhere α i = 1 M and β ≤ 1 M for i = 1, 2, . . . , k -1. Therefore, we reach the conclusion of the schedulability conditions in Eqs. ( 48) and (49) by Lemma 3 and Lemma 4 under given y and ω i s, respectively.\nThe schedulability test in Eq. ( 52) is independent from the settings of y and ω i s. However, the setting of y and ω i s affects how the k -1 higher-priority tasks are indexed. Fortunately, it can be observed that the schedulability tests in Eqs. ( 48) and (49) are completely independent upon the indexing of the higher-priority tasks. Therefore, no matter how y and ω i s are set, the schedulability conditions in Eqs. ( 48) and ( 49) are the corresponding results from the k 2 Q framework. As a result, we can reach the conclusion.\nCorollary 3. The capacity augmentation factor of global RM for a sporadic system with implicit deadlines is 3+ \n∆ max k ≤ 1 - 1 M k-1 i=1 U i + C i D k + 1 M 2 k-1 i=1 U i ( k-1 =i C D k ) ,(53\n) where the k -1 higher-priority tasks are ordered in a nonincreasing order of their periods.\nProof: This is due to a similar proof to that of Theorem 8 and Lemma 9, by applying Lemma 1 with\nt k = D k + y, α i = 1\nM , and β i = 1 M , under the worst-case last release time ordering, βiCi αiUi = T i non-increasingly, in Lemma 2. Therefore, for a given y ≥ 0, if\n∆ max k ≤ 1 -1 M k-1 i=1 U i + Ci D k +y + 1 M 2 k-1 i=1 U i ( k-1 =i C D k +y )\n, task τ k is schedulable by the global fixed-scheduling. By the assumption 8 This comes from the simple algebra property that for any two vectors a and b of size is minimized when y is 0. As a result, the above schedulability condition is the worst when y is 0.\nk-1 i=1 U i ≤ M , we know that C i i =1 U M ≤ C i . Therefore 8 , - 1 M k-1 i=1 C i D k + y + 1 M 2 k-1 i\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>GLOBAL FIXED-PRIORITY SCHEDULING<|>CONCEPT<|>Global fixed-priority scheduling is a scheduling algorithm that assigns priorities to tasks and executes them based on their priority levels in a global context across multiple processors.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SCHEDULABILITY TESTS<|>CONCEPT<|>Schedulability tests are methods used to determine if a set of tasks can meet their deadlines under a given scheduling algorithm.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>COROLLARY 3<|>EVENT<|>Corollary 3 presents a specific result regarding the capacity augmentation factor of global RM for sporadic systems with implicit deadlines.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>THEOREM 8<|>EVENT<|>Theorem 8 provides a condition under which a task in a sporadic task system is schedulable by global RM on multiple processors.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GLOBAL RM<|>CONCEPT<|>Global RM (Rate Monotonic) is a fixed-priority scheduling algorithm where tasks are assigned priorities based on their periods, with shorter periods receiving higher priorities.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SPORADIC TASK SYSTEM<|>CONCEPT<|>A sporadic task system is a type of task scheduling model where tasks arrive at irregular intervals but must meet specific timing constraints.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>THEOREM 8<|>SCHEDULABILITY TESTS<|>Theorem 8 outlines the conditions that must be satisfied for the schedulability tests to be applicable in global fixed-priority scheduling<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>COROLLARY 3<|>GLOBAL RM<|>Corollary 3 discusses the capacity augmentation factor specifically in the context of global RM scheduling<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>GLOBAL FIXED-PRIORITY SCHEDULING<|>SCHEDULABILITY TESTS<|>Global fixed-priority scheduling utilizes schedulability tests to ensure that tasks can meet their deadlines<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>GLOBAL RM<|>GLOBAL FIXED-PRIORITY SCHEDULING<|>Global RM is a specific implementation of global fixed-priority scheduling<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SPORADIC TASK SYSTEM<|>GLOBAL RM<|>Global RM is designed to handle sporadic task systems effectively<|>8)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
