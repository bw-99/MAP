For the MovieLens dataset, the iMARS achieves 43.1√ó/45.6√ó speedup and 516.05√ó/458.12√ó energy reduction over the GPU counterpart on the filtering/ranking stages.\nFrom Table III, it can be seen that on both GPU and iMARS, the ranking stage takes more time and energy than the filtering stage for MovieLens because the ranking stage deploys one more ET than the filtering stage as the memory mapping shown in Table I. Also, the latency and energy for the MovieLens dataset is smaller than another dataset because of the relatively small ET size. These improvements are attributed to the fact that iMARS reduces the data movement between the processor and memory by using in-memory ET lookup. Also the adoption of the FeFET technology contributes to part of the improvement.\n2) NNS operation: NN Search operations are needed in the filtering stage, and are realized by configuring CMAs to the CAM mode in iMARS. The utilization of the CAM search mode enables the NNS operation to be implemented in O(1) time instead of O(n). For the filtering stage on the MovieLens dataset with O(10 3 ) items, the search latency using the original cosine distance on the GPU is around 13.6 ¬µs and it consumes 0.34 mJ for one input. With LSH search with 256 signature length, the GPU spends 6.97 ¬µs and 0.15 mJ. The latency and energy improvement over the GPU counterpart (LSH search) is 3.8e4√ó and 2.8e4√ó as shown in Table II.\n3) End-to-End: We compare the end-to-end improvements of iMARS over GPU in this section. For the GPU data, we only count DNN stack, ET lookup and NNS operation in the algorithm. For iMARS, the ET lookup operation and NNS operation are evaluated as we discussed before. The DNN stack is evaluated using Neurosim [22] (FoM shown in Table II), which brings around 2.69√ó latency improvement compared to the GPU counterpart.\nFor the ranking model on the Criteo Kaggle dataset, iMARS achieves 13.2√ó latency improvement and 57.8√ó energy improvement over GPU. For the filtering and ranking stage together, iMARS achieves 16.8√ó and 713√ó latency/energy end-to-end improvement on the MovieLens dataset. That is, it can achieve 22025 queries/second compared with the 1311 queries/second on the GPU. The end-to-end improvement is dominated by the ranking stage because each user only goes through the filtering stage once in iMARS. However, for each user, the CTR needs to be calculated for each candidate item during the ranking stage. </p><h2>publication_ref</h2> <p>['b21'] </p><h2>figure_ref</h2> <p>[] </p><h2>table_ref</h2> <p>['tab_2', 'tab_2', 'tab_0', 'tab_1', 'tab_1'] </p><h2>heading</h2> <p>V.
