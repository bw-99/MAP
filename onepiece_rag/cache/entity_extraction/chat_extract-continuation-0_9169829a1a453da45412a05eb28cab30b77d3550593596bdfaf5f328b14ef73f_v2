Many techniques aim to solve this issue by feature selection or embedding dimension search. However, these techniques typically select a fixed subset of features or embedding dimensions for all instances and feed all instances into one recommender model without considering heterogeneity between items or users. This paper proposes a novel instance-wise Hierarchical Architecture Search framework, iHAS, which automates neural architecture search at the instance level. Specifically, iHAS incorporates three stages: searching, clustering, and retraining. The searching stage identifies optimal instance-wise embedding dimensions across different field features via carefully designed Bernoulli gates with stochastic selection and regularizers. After obtaining these dimensions, the clustering stage divides samples into distinct groups via a deterministic selection approach of Bernoulli gates. The retraining stage then constructs different recommender models, each one designed with optimal dimensions for the corresponding group. We conduct extensive experiments to evaluate the proposed iHAS on two public benchmark datasets from a real-world recommender system. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of iHAS and its outstanding transferability to widely-used deep recommendation models. </p><h1>sections</h1><h2>heading</h2> <p>INTRODUCTION </p><h2>text</h2> <p>Recommender systems, which aim to predict the preference of users, have been widely deployed in various real-world scenarios, e.g., online advertising [3,27], social media [9], news apps [39], etc. Deep learning recommendation models (DLRMs) typically take a large amount of categorical (e.g., gender) or numerical (e.g., age) field features as input. These features are first encoded into highdimensional sparse one-hot vectors, which are later mapped into real-valued dense vectors via embedding tables. The recommender model then feeds these embeddings into a feature interaction layer which usually consists of deep neural network (DNN) [6] or factorization machine (FM) [8,14,26,34] to model user preferences for final prediction.\nThe embedding tables play a fundamental role in the recommendation system, as they dominate the majority of parameters. However, most existing methods construct their proposed recommender models with large-sized embedding tables and a uniform dimension size for all possible fields [8,10,29], which may lead to overfitting, high computational cost, and poor model generalization [15,25,33]. Therefore, the first objective for an optimal DLRM is to find optimal embedding dimensions for different fields and remove redundant dimensions. Performing embedding dimension search is also sufficient to include feature selection, i.e., the optimal dimension for a field feature could be zero, which means completely excluding this feature.\nA common approach for embedding dimension search is to employ the l 0 norm on the dimensions to penalize the count of nonzero dimension entries. However, as the l 0 norm poses a computational challenge for gradient descent, researchers have attempted to substitute l 0 with a surrogate function, such as the l 1 norm for LASSO [32], yet achieving limited selection ability [35]. Recently, probabilistic approaches [18,33] suggest utilizing Bernoulli random variables (RVs) with Gumbel-Softmax approximations to identify the top ùêæ features with the highest probabilities. Though these methods can be applied for dimension selection, we have empirically observed that the probabilities learned are often indistinguishable. Therefore, selecting the top ùêæ features/dimensions based on these probabilities may inadvertently result in either the exclusion of critical features/dimensions or the inclusion of irrelevant ones.\nFurthermore, prior approaches uniformly apply embedding dimension selection across all instances in the datasets, therefore disregarding the inherent variations between individual samples. This one-size-for-all approach can be inadequate in many scenarios, especially when dealing with highly heterogeneous populations where relevant features can significantly diverge across users or across items. For example, in a movie recommendation system, the feature \"age\" usually plays a crucial role in recommending Disney movies, thereby possibly necessitating a larger embedding dimension. Conversely, \"age\" is less relevant for comedy films, resulting in a smaller dimension size. Thus, it is evident that treating all instances identically may overlook these context-specific nuances. Intuitively speaking, when dimension selection is performed at the instance level, we can create neural architectures that are better suited to individual samples. Such an approach not only results in superior performance but also enables faster inference times by focusing on the most relevant dimensions of each sample.\nIn this paper, we propose an instance-wise Hierarchical Architecture Search framework, iHAS, which attempts to perform automatic architecture search on the instance level, using hierarchical training procedures for DLRMs. Specifically, iHAS includes three learning stages: searching, clustering, and retraining. The searching stage aims to find the optimal instance-wise embedding dimensions across different fields via a carefully designed \"Bernoulli gate\" with stochastic selection mode and a regularizer. After selecting instancewise embedding dimensions, we separate samples into different groups based on a novel deterministic selection approach in the clustering stage. The retraining stage trains different recommender models, with optimal dimensions tailored to different groups. During inference time, each test sample will first be assigned to a suitable group, where predictions are made by the corresponding recommender model. We summarize our major contributions as:\n‚Ä¢ We propose a hierarchical training framework that uses instance-wise \"Bernoulli gates\" to facilitate effective dimension search for each sample. ‚Ä¢ We apply a sparse and bi-polarization regularizer in the objective function to help the model learn distinguishable Bernoulli RVs, and use a threshold selector for downstream deterministic selection. ‚Ä¢ To balance the trade-off between the one-size-for-all and full-custom\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>RECOMMENDER SYSTEMS<|>concept<|>Recommender systems are algorithms designed to predict user preferences and suggest items based on historical data, widely used in various applications such as online advertising and social media.)\n(\"entity\"<|>EMBEDDING TABLES<|>concept<|>Embedding tables are structures used in recommender systems to convert categorical and numerical features into dense vector representations, playing a crucial role in modeling user preferences.)\n(\"entity\"<|>INSTANCE-WISE HIERARCHICAL ARCHITECTURE SEARCH (IHAS)<|>concept<|>iHAS is a proposed framework that automates neural architecture search at the instance level, incorporating searching, clustering, and retraining stages to optimize recommender models.)\n(\"entity\"<|>BERNOULLI GATES<|>concept<|>Bernoulli gates are mechanisms used in the iHAS framework for stochastic selection of optimal embedding dimensions, facilitating effective feature selection.)\n(\"entity\"<|>DEEP LEARNING RECOMMENDATION MODELS (DLRMs)<|>concept<|>DLRMs are advanced models that utilize deep learning techniques to enhance the performance of recommender systems by processing large amounts of input features.)\n(\"entity\"<|>FEATURE SELECTION<|>concept<|>Feature selection is the process of identifying and selecting a subset of relevant features for use in model construction, crucial for improving model performance and reducing overfitting.)\n(\"entity\"<|>PUBLIC BENCHMARK DATASETS<|>concept<|>Public benchmark datasets are standardized datasets used for evaluating the performance of recommender systems and other machine learning models.)\n(\"relationship\"<|>RECOMMENDER SYSTEMS<|>EMBEDDING TABLES<|>Embedding tables are integral to recommender systems as they transform input features into dense vectors for preference modeling<|>9)\n(\"relationship\"<|>IHAS<|>RECOMMENDER SYSTEMS<|>iHAS aims to improve the performance of recommender systems by optimizing architecture at the instance level<|>8)\n(\"relationship\"<|>BERNOULLI GATES<|>IHAS<|>Bernoulli gates are utilized within the iHAS framework to facilitate the selection of optimal embedding dimensions<|>7)\n(\"relationship\"<|>DLRMs<|>RECOMMENDER SYSTEMS<|>Deep learning recommendation models are a type of recommender system that leverages deep learning techniques for enhanced performance<|>8)\n(\"relationship\"<|>FEATURE SELECTION<|>EMBEDDING TABLES<|>Feature selection is essential for optimizing embedding tables by identifying the most relevant features for the recommender model<|>6)\n(\"relationship\"<|>PUBLIC BENCHMARK DATASETS<|>IHAS<|>Public benchmark datasets are used to evaluate the effectiveness of the iHAS framework in real-world recommender systems<|>7) \n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
