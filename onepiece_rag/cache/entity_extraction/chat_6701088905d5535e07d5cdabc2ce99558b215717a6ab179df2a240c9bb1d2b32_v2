In the graph learning domain, recent works [11,43,45,47,89,92,96,97] have generalized graph neural networks to hyperbolic space and demonstrated impressive performance, particularly on tree-like data. Some studies [60,71,82,103] propose learning graph in different embedding spaces or product spaces. Furthermore, researchers have also explored the use of ultrahyperbolic geometry for graph learning [38,39,85,86]. However, many existing methods fail to consider the local heterogeneous structure of graphs, resulting in significant distortion and low-quality embeddings. </p><h2>publication_ref</h2> <p>['b16', 'b101', 'b36', 'b62', 'b71', 'b72', 'b49', 'b60', 'b89', 'b4', 'b29', 'b33', 'b7', 'b9', 'b35', 'b50', 'b55', 'b56', 'b61', 'b13', 'b69', 'b79', 'b80', 'b86', 'b90', 'b6', 'b10', 'b26', 'b42', 'b44', 'b88', 'b95', 'b83', 'b10', 'b42', 'b44', 'b46', 'b88', 'b91', 'b95', 'b96', 'b59', 'b70', 'b81', 'b102', 'b37', 'b38', 'b84', 'b85'] </p><h2>figure_ref</h2> <p>[] </p><h2>table_ref</h2> <p>[] </p><h2>heading</h2> <p>Graph Curvature </p><h2>text</h2> <p>Graph curvature, resembling curvature in continuous geometry, includes Gaussian curvature, Ricci curvature, and average curvature.

Applications of graph curvatures span various domains in network alignment, congestion and vulnerability detection, community detection, and robustness analysis [32,54,55].\nThe recent work of curvature graph neural network (CurvGN) [93] introduced the notion of Ricci curvature into the field of graph learning. The study in [74] showed that edges with negative curvature can contribute to the over-squashing problem in graph embeddings. Coinciding with the announcement of the accepted papers for WWW 2023, we noted a parallel work by Fu et al. [22] that introduces the idea of class-aware Ricci curvature for addressing hierarchy-imbalance in node classification, while in our work, we aim to explore the integration of more generalized ricci curvature with hyperbolic graph convolution and curvature-based filtering mechanism to enhance the performance of HGCN for a more range of tasks, including node classification and link prediction. </p><h2>publication_ref</h2> <p>['b31', 'b53', 'b54', 'b92', 'b73', 'b21'] </p><h2>figure_ref</h2> <p>[] </p><h2>table_ref</h2> <p>[] </p><h2>heading</h2> <p>BACKGROUND </p><h2>text</h2> <p>In this part, we first briefly review the necessary definitions of differential geometry, primarily concentrating on hyperbolic geometry.
