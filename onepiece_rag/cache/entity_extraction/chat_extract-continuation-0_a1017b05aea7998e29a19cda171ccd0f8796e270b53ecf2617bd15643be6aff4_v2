However, approximating a discrete tree-like graph with a hyperbolic manifold can result in inevitable distortions, as real-world tree-like graphs are inherently complex. In this work, we integrate the intrinsic graph structure into the continuous hyperbolic embedding space via the discrete Ricci curvature. As expected, the graph curvature facilitates the node to perceive the role and the hierarchy it belongs to, helping accelerate the hierarchical formation as well as alleviate the distortion in local clusters or cliques. The superiority of the proposal is demonstrated by extensive experiments. Curvature is a geometric notion with appealing and descriptive properties for both network and continuous space. Via the interaction of curvatures, we can build proper connections for a graph and the embedding space to obtain high-quality representations, which is a promising direction to advance geometric learning. In the future, we will consider the use of Ricci flow, a more sophisticated geometric concept derived from Ricci curvature, to further enhance graph embedding and graph machine learning in tree-likeness modeling. </p><h2>publication_ref</h2> <p>[] </p><h2>figure_ref</h2> <p>[] </p><h2>table_ref</h2> <p>[] </p><h2>heading</h2> <p>APPENDIX A DATASETS </p><h2>text</h2> <p>In this section, we provide details about the datasets used in our study. The Disease dataset contains nodes that are labeled as infected or not infected with a disease, with features indicating their susceptibility to the disease. The disease-spreading network in this dataset displays a clear hierarchical structure, which makes it ideal for testing the effectiveness of hyperbolic embedding models. We use this dataset to validate our proposal. The Airport dataset consists of nodes representing airports, with edges indicating the existence of routes between two airports and labels reflecting the population of the respective country that the airport belongs to. In contrast, the PubMed and Cora datasets represent scientific papers as nodes, with edges indicating citations and labels corresponding to academic subfields. Additionally, the Disease and Airport datasets have imbalanced node labels, rendering accuracy an inadequate measure of model performance. Therefore, we use the F1 score as a more suitable measure for imbalanced datasets. Conversely, for the remaining datasets with balanced node classes, we use accuracy to evaluate the models. Furthermore, note that according to the official code of HGCN 5 , the data statistics for Disease in node classification and link prediction differ slightly, and we list them separately in Table 2 for clarity.\nHyperbolicity 𝛿 is a metric that quantifies how closely a graph resembles a tree structure, with lower values of 𝛿 indicating greater tree-like characteristics. A 𝛿 value of 0 corresponds to a tree, while higher hyperbolicity values indicate a less tree-like structure. The relationship between hyperbolicity and tree-like characteristics has been established in various studies, including [3,32,53]. </p><h2>publication_ref</h2> <p>['b2', 'b31', 'b52'] </p><h2>figure_ref</h2> <p>[] </p><h2>table_ref</h2> <p>['tab_2'] </p><h2>heading</h2> <p>B HYPERBOLIC GEOMETRY </p><h2>text</h2> <p>The geometry of a Riemannian manifold is defined by its curvature: elliptic geometry for positive curvature, Euclidean geometry for zero curvature, and hyperbolic geometry for negative curvature.
