For any event A, we let A be the complement of A. Also, for sets S a and S b , the relative complement of S a in S b is given by S a \\ S b .\nIn graph G on , for each node v i ∈ V, we define N i as the set of neighbors of node v i . For any two distinct nodes v x and v y , there are (n-2) nodes other than v x and v y in graph G on . These (n -2) nodes can be split into the four sets N xy , N xy , N xy and N x y as follows. Let N xy be the set of nodes that are neighbors of both v x and v y ; i.e., N xy = N x ∩ N y . Let N xy denote the set of nodes in V \\ v x , v y  that are neighbors of v x , but are not neighbors of v y . Similarly, N xy is defined as the set of nodes in V \\ v x , v y  that are not neighbors of v x , but are neighbors of v y . Finally, N x y is the set of nodes in V \\ v x , v y  that are not connected to either v x or v y .\nFor any three distinct nodes v x , v y and v j , recalling that E xj (resp., E yj ) is the event that there exists a link between nodes v x (resp., v y ) and v j , we define\nE xj∩yj := E xj ∩ E yj , E xj∩yj := E xj ∩ E yj , E xj∩yj := E xj ∩ E yj , and E xj∩yj := E xj ∩ E yj .\nIn graph G on , for any non-negative integer ℓ, let X ℓ be the number of nodes having degree ℓ; let D x,ℓ be the event that node v x has degree ℓ. We define δ as the minimum node degree of graph G on , and define κ as the connectivity of graph G on . The connectivity of a graph is defined as the minimum number of nodes whose deletion renders the graph disconnected; thus, a graph is k-connected if and only if its connectivity is at least k. Finally, a graph is said to be simply connected if its connectivity is at least 1, i.e., if it is 1-connected. </p><h2>publication_ref</h2> <p>[] </p><h2>figure_ref</h2> <p>[] </p><h2>table_ref</h2> <p>[] </p><h2>heading</h2> <p>VI.
