We use the D&C [30] as the specific implementation of file-level IRFL available online [1] , which is a machine learning-based IRFL tool using a similarity matrix of 70-dimension feature vectors (7 features from bug reports and 10 features from source code files): D&C uses multiple classifier models that are trained each for specific groups of bug reports. Given a bug report, the different predictions of the different classifiers are merged to yield a single list of suspicious code files. Our execution of D&C (Line 2 in Algorithm 1) is tractable given that we only need to preprocess those bug reports that we must localize. Trained classifiers are already available. We ensure that no data leakage is induced (i.e., the classifiers are not trained with bug reports that we want to localize in this work). </p><h2>publication_ref</h2> <p>['b40', 'b29', 'b0'] </p><h2>figure_ref</h2> <p>[] </p><h2>table_ref</h2> <p>[] </p><h2>heading</h2> <p>Ranking Suspicious </p><h2>text</h2> <p>Statements. Patch generation requires fine-grained information on code entities that must be changed. For iFixR, we propose to produce a standard output, as for spectrumbased fault localization, to facilitate integration and reuse of stateof-the-art patch generation techniques. To start, we build on the conclusions on a recent large-scale study [47] of bug fixes to limit the search space of suspicious locations to the statements that are more error-prone. After investigating in detail the abstract syntax tree (AST)-based code differences of over 16 000 real-world patches from Java projects, Liu et al. [47] reported that the following specific AST statement nodes were significantly more prone to be faulty than others: IfStatements, ExpressionStatements, FieldDeclarations, ReturnStatements and VariableDeclara-tionStatements. Lines 7-17 in Algorithm 1 detail the process to produce a ranked list of suspicious statements.\nAlgorithm 1 describes the process of our fault localization approach used in iFixR. Top k files are selected among the returned list of suspicious files of the IRFL along with their computed suspiciousness scores. Then each file is parsed to retain only the relevant error-prone statements from which textual tokens are extracted. The summary and descriptions of the bug report are also analyzed  return Sscor e (lexically) to collect all its tokens. Due to the specific nature of stack traces and other code elements which may appear in the bug report, we use regular expressions to detect stack traces and code elements to improve the tokenization process, which is based on punctuations, camel case splitting (e.g., findNumber splits into find, number) as well as snake case splitting (e.g., find_number splits into find, number). Stop word removalfoot_1 is then applied before performing stemming (using the PorterStemmer [24]) on all tokens to create homogeneity with the term's root (i.e., by conflating variants of the same term). Each bag of tokens (for the bug report, and for each statement) is then eventually used to build a feature vector. We use cosine similarity among the vectors to rank the file statements that are relevant to the bug report.\nGiven that we considered k files, the statements of each having their own similarity score with respect to the bug report, we weight these scores with the suspiciousness score of the associated file. Eventually, we sort the statements using the weighted scores and produce a ranked list of code locations (i.e., statements in files) to be recommended as candidate fault locations. </p><h2>publication_ref</h2> <p>['b46', 'b46', 'b23'] </p><h2>figure_ref</h2> <p>[] </p><h2>table_ref</h2> <p>[] </p><h2>heading</h2> <p>Fix Pattern-based Patch Generation </p><h2>text</h2> <p>A common, and reliable, strategy in automatic program repair is to generate concrete patches based on fix patterns [26] (also referred to as fix templates [51] or program transformation schemas [18]). Several APR systems [14,18,26,31,46,48,49,51,60,73] in the literature implement this strategy by using diverse sets of fix patterns obtained either via manual generation or automatic mining of bug fix datasets. In this work, we consider the pioneer PAR system by Kim et al. [26]. Concretely, we build on kPAR [48], an open-source Java implementation of PAR in which we included a diverse set of fix patterns collected from the literature. Table 4 provides an enumeration of fix patterns used in this work. For more implementation details, we refer the reader to our replication package. All tools and data are released as open source to the community to foster further research into these directions. As illustrated in Figure 3, a fix pattern encodes the recipe of change actions that should be applied to mutate a code element.  For a given reported bug, once our fault localizer yields its list of suspicious statements, iFixR iteratively attempts to select fix patterns for each statement. The selection of fix patterns is conducted in a naïve way based on the context information of each suspicious statement (i.e., all nodes in its abstract syntax tree, AST). Specifically, iFixR parses the code and traverses each node of the suspicious statement AST from its first child node to its last leaf node in a breadth-first strategy (i.e, left-to-right and\n######################\noutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}}
