Section 4.2) to re-prioritize the patch candidates towards ensuring that patches which are recommended first will eventually be correct (or at least plausible when relevant test cases are implemented). We present results both for the case where we do not re-prioritize and the case where we re-prioritize.\nRecall that, given that the re-organized benchmark separately includes the future test cases, we can leverage them to systematize the assessment of patch plausibility. The correctness (also referred to as correctness [69]) of patches, however, is still decided manually by comparing against the actual bug fix provided by developers and available in the benchmark. Overall, we note that iFixR performance is promising as it manages, for 13 bugs, to present a plausible patch among its top-5 recommended patches per bug. Among those plausible patches, 8 are eventually found to be correct.  [19] which uses sophisticated techniques to improve the fault localization accuracy and search for fix ingredients. It should be noted that in this case, our prioritization strategy is not applied to the generated patches. iFixR opt represents the reference performance for our experiment which assesses the prioritization. Table 10 provides the comparison matrix. Information on stateof-the-art results are excerpted from their respective publications.\niFixR offers a reasonable performance in patch recommendation when we consider the number of Defects4J bugs that are successfully patched among the top-5 (in a scenario where we assume not having relevant test cases to validate the patch candidates). Performance results are even comparable to many state-of-the-art test-based APR tools in the literature. </p><h2>publication_ref</h2> <p>['b68', 'b18'] </p><h2>figure_ref</h2> <p>[] </p><h2>table_ref</h2> <p>['tab_11', 'tab_12'] </p><h2>heading</h2> <p>5.3.3 </p><h2>text</h2> <p>Properties of iFixR's patches.

Priority information about the bug report is collected from the issue tracking systems, while the root cause is inferred by analyzing the bug reports and fixes. Overall, we note that 9 out of the 13 bugs have been marked as Major issues. 12 different bug types (i.e., root causes) are addressed.

We set strong constraints on the absence of test cases, which are used in test-based APR to approximate what the program is actually supposed to do and when the repair is completed [83]. Our experiments on the widely-used Defects4J bugs eventually show that patch generation without bug-triggering test cases is promising.\nManually looking at the details of failures and success in generating patches with iFixR, several insights can be drawn: Test cases can be buggy: During manual analysis of results, we noted that iFixR actually fails to generate correct patches for three bugs (namely, Math-5, Math-59 and Math-65) because even the test cases were buggy. Figure 7 illustrates the example of bug Math-5 where its patch also updated the relevant test case. This example supports our endeavor, given that users would find and report bugs for which the appropriate test cases were never properly written.\n// Patched Source Code: ---a/src/main/java/org/apache/commons/math3/complex/Complex.java +++ b/src/main/java/org/apache/commons/math3/complex/Complex.java @@ -304,3 +304,3 @@ public class Complex if (real == 0.0 && imaginary == 0.  Bug reports deserve more interest: With iFixR, we have shown that bug reports could be handled automatically for a variety of bugs. This is an opportunity for issue trackers to add a recommendation layer to the bug triaging process by integrating patch generation techniques. There are, however, several directions to further investigation, among which: (1) help users write proper bug reports; and (2) re-investigate IRFL techniques at a finer-grained level that is suitable for APR. Prioritization techniques must be investigated: In the absence of complete test suites for validating every single patch candidate, a recommendation system must ensure that patches presented first to the developers are the most likely to be plausible and even correct.
