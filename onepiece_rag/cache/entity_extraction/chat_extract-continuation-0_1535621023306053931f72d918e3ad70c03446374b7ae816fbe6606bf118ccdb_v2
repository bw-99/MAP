That is, by Eq. (1),\nC k + τi∈hp(τ k ) t Ti C i > t for any 0 < t < R k and C k + τi∈hp(τ k ) R k Ti C i = R k .\nSimilar to Example 1, let |hp(τ k )| be k -1 and the tasks in hp(τ k ) be ordered by ( R k Ti -1)T i non-decreasingly, i.e.,\nt 1 ≤ t 2 ≤ • • • ≤ t k-1 ≤ R k . With the same analysis in Example 1, we know that C k + k-1 i=1 t i U i + j-1 i=1 C i > t j for j = 1, 2, . . . , k -1 and R k ≤ C k + k-1 i=1 t i U i + k-1 i=1 C i .\nAs a result, by the specific index rule of the tasks in hp(τ k ) and setting α i = 1 and β i = 1 for every task τ i in hp(τ k ), we reach a concrete example for Definition 3. </p><h2>publication_ref</h2> <p>[] </p><h2>figure_ref</h2> <p>[] </p><h2>table_ref</h2> <p>[] </p><h2>heading</h2> <p>Important Notes </p><h2>text</h2> <p>Before presenting the analyses based on Definition 2 and Definition 3, we would like to first explain the important assumptions and the flow to use the analytical results. Throughout the paper, we implicitly assume that t k > 0 when Definition 2 is used. Moreover, we only consider non-trivial cases, in which C k > 0 and 0 < U i ≤ 1 for i = 1, 2, . . . , k-1. The definition of t k depends on how Definition 2 is constructed based on the original schedulability test, usually equal to the length of the interval (of the points to be tested in the original schedulability test), e.g., t k = T k = D k in Example 1. In most of the cases, we can set t k as D k . But, it can also be set to other cases, to be demonstrated in Appendix C for global RM scheduling.\nIn Definition 2, the k-point last-release schedulability test is a sufficient schedulability test that tests only k time points, defined by the k-1 higher-priority tasks and task τ k . Similarly, in Definition 3, a k-point last-release response time analysis provides a safe response time by only testing whether task τ k has already finished earlier at k -1 points, each defined by a higher-priority task.\nIn both cases in Definitions 2 and 3, the last release time ordering π is assumed to be given. In some cases, this ordering can be easily obtained. For such cases, all the lemmas in this section can be directly adopted. However, in most of the cases in our demonstrated task models, we have to test all possible last release time orderings and take the worst case. Fortunately, we will show that finding the worst-case ordering is not a difficult problem, which requires to sort the k -1 higherpriority tasks under a simple criteria, in Lemmas 2 and 7. Therefore, for such cases, the lemmas in this section have to be adopted by combining with Lemma 2 or 7.\nWe first assume that the corresponding coefficients α i and β i in Definitions 2 and 3 are given. How to derive them will be discussed in the following sections. Clearly their values are highly dependent upon the task models and the scheduling policies. Provided that these coefficients α i , β i , C i , U i for every higher-priority task τ i ∈ hp(τ k ) are given, we analyze (1) the response time by finding the extreme case for a given C k (under Definition 3), or (2) the schedulability by finding the extreme case for a given C k and D k . Therefore, the k 2 Q framework provides utilization-based schedulability analyses and response time analyses automatically if the corresponding parameters α i and β i can be defined to ensure that the tests in Definitions 2 and 3 are safe.\nk 2 Q can be used by a wide range of applications, as Demonstrated Applications:\nSec. 5: Arbitrary-deadline sporadic tasks Sec. 5:\nMultiprocessor RM App. D: Periodic tasks with jitters App. E: Generalized multiframe App. F: Acyclic and Multi-Mode Models long as the users can properly specify the corresponding task properties C i and U i and the constant coefficients α i and β i of every higher-priority task τ i . More precisely, the formulation in Definitions 2 and 3 does not actually care what C i and U i actually mean. When sporadic task models are considered, we will use these two terms as they were defined in Section 2, i.e., C i stands for the execution time and U i is Ci Ti . When we consider more general cases, such as the generalized multiframe and multi-mode task models, we have to properly define the values of U i and C i to apply the framework.\nU i , ∀i < k C i , ∀i < k α i , ∀i < k β i ,\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>K2Q<|>CONCEPT<|>K2Q is a framework that provides utilization-based schedulability analyses and response time analyses for task scheduling in computing systems.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DEFINITION 2<|>CONCEPT<|>Definition 2 is a sufficient schedulability test that tests k time points defined by higher-priority tasks and a specific task τ k.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DEFINITION 3<|>CONCEPT<|>Definition 3 provides a safe response time analysis by testing whether task τ k has finished earlier at k -1 points defined by higher-priority tasks.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SCHEDULABILITY TEST<|>EVENT<|>A schedulability test is an analysis method used to determine if a set of tasks can be scheduled to meet their deadlines under a given scheduling policy.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>RESPONSE TIME ANALYSIS<|>EVENT<|>Response time analysis is a method to determine the time taken for a task to complete after its release under a scheduling policy.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>HIGHER-PRIORITY TASKS<|>CONCEPT<|>Higher-priority tasks are tasks that have a higher priority level than a given task τ k in a scheduling context.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>TASK MODELS<|>CONCEPT<|>Task models define the characteristics and behaviors of tasks in scheduling, including execution time and deadlines.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SPORADIC TASK MODELS<|>CONCEPT<|>Sporadic task models are a type of task model where tasks are released at irregular intervals but must meet certain timing constraints.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MULTI-MODE TASK MODELS<|>CONCEPT<|>Multi-mode task models allow tasks to have different execution times based on their operational mode.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>K2Q<|>DEFINITION 2<|>K2Q framework utilizes Definition 2 to perform schedulability tests for task scheduling<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>K2Q<|>DEFINITION 3<|>K2Q framework utilizes Definition 3 to perform response time analyses for task scheduling<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>DEFINITION 2<|>SCHEDULABILITY TEST<|>Definition 2 is a specific method used for conducting schedulability tests<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>DEFINITION 3<|>RESPONSE TIME ANALYSIS<|>Definition 3 is a specific method used for conducting response time analyses<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>HIGHER-PRIORITY TASKS<|>DEFINITION 2<|>Higher-priority tasks are integral to the conditions set in Definition 2 for schedulability testing<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>HIGHER-PRIORITY TASKS<|>DEFINITION 3<|>Higher-priority tasks are integral to the conditions set in Definition 3 for response time analysis<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>TASK MODELS<|>SPORADIC TASK MODELS<|>Sporadic task models are a specific type of task model used in scheduling<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>TASK MODELS<|>MULTI-MODE TASK MODELS<|>Multi-mode task models are another specific type of task model used in scheduling<|>5)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
