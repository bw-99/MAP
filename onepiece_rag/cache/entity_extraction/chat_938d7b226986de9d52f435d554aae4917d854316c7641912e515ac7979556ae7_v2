In fact, in the case of random key graph G(n, K n , P n ) it is a common practice [2], [32], [39] to replace p s by\nK 2 n\nPn , owing to the fact [39] that\np s ∼ K 2 n P n if K 2 n P n = o(1).(14)\nHowever, when random key graph G(n, K n , P n ) is intersected with an ER graph G(n, p n ) (as in the case of G on ) the simplification does not occur naturally (even under ( 14)), and as seen below, simpler forms of the zero-one laws are obtained at the expense of extra conditions enforced on the parameters K n and P n .\nCorollary 1. Consider a positive integer k, and scalings K, P : N 0 → N 0 , p : N 0 → (0, 1) such that K n ≥ 2 for all n sufficiently large. We define a sequence α : N 0 → R such that for any n ∈ N 0 , we have\np n • K 2 n P n = ln n + (k -1) ln ln n + α n n . (15\n)\nThe properties (a) and (b) below hold. (a) If\nK 2 n Pn = O( 1 ln n ) and lim n→∞ (ln n + (k -1) ln ln n + α n ) = ∞, then lim n→∞ P [G on is k-connected ] = 0 if lim n→∞ α n = -∞,(16)\nand\nlim n→∞ P Minimum node degree of G on is no less than k = 0 if lim n→∞ α n = -∞. (17\n) (b) If P n = Ω(n) and K 2 n Pn = O( 1 ln n ), then lim n→∞ P [G on is k-connected ] = 1 if lim n→∞ α n = ∞, (18\n)\nand\nlim n→∞ P Minimum node degree of G on is no less than k = 1 if lim n→∞ α n = ∞.(19)\nA proof of Corollary 1 can be found in Section IV-F. Note that the condition\nK 2 n Pn = O( 1 ln n ) enforced in Corollary 1 implies both Kn Pn = o(1)\nand\nK 2 n Pn = o(1)\n, and thus it is a stronger condition than those enforced in Theorem 1. </p><h2>publication_ref</h2> <p>['b1', 'b31', 'b38', 'b38'] </p><h2>figure_ref</h2> <p>[] </p><h2>table_ref</h2> <p>[] </p><h2>heading</h2> <p>C.

As discussed in Section IV-D below, this result improves the one given implicitly by Rybarczyk [33].\nCorollary 2. Consider a positive integer k, and scalings K, P : N 0 → N 0 such that K n ≥ 2 for all n sufficiently large. With α : N 0 → R given by\nK 2 n P n = ln n + (k -1) ln ln n + α n n , n = 1, 2, . . . ,(20)\nthe following two properties hold. (a) If either there exists an ǫ > 0 such that n\nK 2 n\nPn > ǫ for all n sufficiently large, or lim n→∞ n K 2 n Pn = 0, then we have\nlim n→∞ P [G(n, K n , P n ) is k-connected ] = 0 if lim n→∞ α n = -∞. (b) If P n = Ω(n), then we have lim n→∞ P [G(n, K n , P n ) is k-connected ] = 1 if lim n→∞ α n = ∞.\nA proof of Corollary 2 can be found in Section IV-G. </p><h2>publication_ref</h2> <p>['b32'] </p><h2>figure_ref</h2> <p>[] </p><h2>table_ref</h2> <p>[] </p><h2>heading</h2> <p>D. Discussion and Comparison with Related Results </p><h2>text</h2> <p>As already noted in the literature [2], [11], [12], [32], [33], [39], Erdős-Rényi graph G(n, p n ) and random key graph G(n, K n , P n ) have similar k-connectivity properties when they are matched through their link probabilities; i.e. when p n = p s with p s as defined in (5). In particular, Erdős and Rényi [12] showed that if p n = ln n+(k-1) ln ln n+αn n , then G(n, p n )\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}}
