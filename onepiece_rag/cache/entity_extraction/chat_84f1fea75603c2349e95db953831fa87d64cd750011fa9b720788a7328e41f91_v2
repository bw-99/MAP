Next, we inspect the ratings for the first user. We can select an individual user with the extraction operator.<h2>publication_ref</h2>['b13']<h2>figure_ref</h2>[]<h2>table_ref</h2>[]<h2>heading</h2>R> rowCounts(r[1,])<h2>text</h2>u20648 74\nR> as(r[1,], \"list\") $ 0 j1 j2 j3 j4 j5 j6 j7 j8 j9 j10 j11 j12 -2.86 1. 75 -4.03 -5.78 2.23 -5.44 -3.40 8.74 -4.51 3.74  The user has rated 74 jokes, the list shows the ratings and the user's rating average is -0.423243243243243 .\nNext, we look at several distributions to understand the data better. getRatings() extracts a vector with all non-missing ratings from a rating matrix.<h2>publication_ref</h2>[]<h2>figure_ref</h2>[]<h2>table_ref</h2>[]<h2>heading</h2>R> hist(getRatings(r), breaks=100)<h2>text</h2>In the histogram in Figure 5 shoes an interesting distribution where all negative values occur with a almost identical frequency and the positive ratings more frequent with a steady decline towards the rating 10. Since this distribution can be the result of users with strong rating bias, we look next at the rating distribution after normalization.<h2>publication_ref</h2>[]<h2>figure_ref</h2>['fig_6']<h2>table_ref</h2>[]<h2>heading</h2>R> hist(getRatings(normalize(r)), breaks=100)<h2>text</h2>R> hist(getRatings(normalize(r, method=\"Z-score\")), breaks=100)\nFigure 6 shows that the distribution of ratings ins closer to a normal distribution after row centering and Z-score normalization additionally reduces the variance to a range of roughly -3 to +3 standard deviations. It is interesting to see that there is a pronounced peak of ratings between zero and two.  R> hist(colMeans(r), breaks=20)\nFigure 7 shows that there are unusually many users with ratings around 70 and users who have rated all jokes. The average ratings per joke look closer to a normal distribution with a mean above 0.<h2>publication_ref</h2>[]<h2>figure_ref</h2>[]<h2>table_ref</h2>[]<h2>heading</h2>Creating a recommender<h2>text</h2>A recommender is created using the creator function Recommender().
