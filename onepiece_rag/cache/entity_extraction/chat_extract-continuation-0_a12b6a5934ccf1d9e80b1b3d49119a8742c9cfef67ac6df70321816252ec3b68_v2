NUMERICAL EXPERIMENTS We present numerical experiments to back up our theoretical results. Figure 1 depicts the probability that graph G(n, X, Y ) is k-connected. We let X vary, with other parameters fixed at n = 3, 000, Y = 30, 000 and k = 3, 7. The empirical probabilities corresponding to the experimental curves are obtained as follows: we count the times of k-connectivity out of 500 independent samples of G(n, X, Y ), and derive the empirical probability through dividing its corresponding count by 500. For the theoretical curves, we first compute α by setting the edge probability 1 -\n( Y -X X ) ( Y X )\n(viz., (45) in the Appendix) as ln n+(k-1) ln ln n+α n and then use e -e -α (k-1)! as the theoretical value for the probability of k-connectivity. Figure 1 confirms our analytical results as the experimental and theoretical curves are close.\nV. RELATED WORK For a random key graph G(n, X n , Y n ), Rybarczyk [6] derives the asymptotically exact probabilities of connectivity and of the property that the minimum node degree is no less than 1, covering a weaker form of the results -the zero-one laws which are also obtained in [2], [10].
