This enables us to initiate a combinatorial search process over the space of Bernoulli probabilities and FC parameters. However, optimizing a loss function, which includes discrete RVs (Bernoulli distributions), incurs high variance [23]. To overcome this obstacle, we adopt Gumbel-Softmax [11] (aka Concrete distribution [21]), which offers a viable continuous approximation to the Bernoulli distribution, as visualized in Figure 2 (right).\nRecall that Gumbel-Max [7,22] is an effective method for drawing samples from a Bernoulli distribution (or any type of discrete random variables), as long as we provide the class probabilities. For instance, if we use 𝑝 𝑖,𝑗 and 1 -𝑝 𝑖,𝑗 as the probabilities for selecting and not selecting the 𝑗-th embedding dimension for sample 𝑖, respectively, the Gumbel-Max trick to approximate Bernoulli distribution sampling can then be expressed as:\n𝒛 𝑖,𝑗 = one hot (arg max (log 𝑝 𝑖,𝑗 + 𝐺 𝑖,𝑗 , log(1 -𝑝 𝑖,𝑗 ) + 𝐺 ′ 𝑖,𝑗 )),(1)\nwhere 𝐺 𝑖,𝑗 and 𝐺 ′ 𝑖,𝑗 are i.i.d. samples drawn from a Gumbel distribution with the location at 0 and scale of 1, denoted as Gumbel(0, 1). However, both the \"one hot()\" and \"arg max()\" operations are nondifferentiable, making them intractable for gradient descent optimization. Therefore, the softmax function is used as a continuous, (2) As 𝜏 approaches 0, 𝒛 𝑖,𝑗 approximates the true binary vector, making the Gumbel-Softmax distribution become identical to the desired Bernoulli distribution. Then the final embedding masks, 𝒎 𝑖 , are created by concatenating the first bit of 𝒛 𝑖,𝑗  𝑁 * 𝑗=1 . However, our goal remains to produce true binary masks, which would effectively eliminate information from unimportant dimensions, as opposed to significantly shrinking them. The straightthrough (ST) Gumbel-Softmax [2,11] serves well in this context. In the ST variant, the operation from Equation 1 is implemented in the forward pass while the continuous approximation from Equation 2is used in the backward gradient descent. This approach enables sparse selection even when the temperature 𝜏 is high, while still allowing the gradient to propagate and update the parameters. </p><h2>publication_ref</h2> <p>['b22', 'b10', 'b20', 'b6', 'b21', 'b1', 'b10'] </p><h2>figure_ref</h2> <p>['fig_1', 'fig_1'] </p><h2>table_ref</h2> <p>[] </p><h2>heading</h2> <p>Deterministic Selection. </p><h2>text</h2> <p>After training the Bernoulli probabilities (𝑝 𝑖,𝑗 ) during the searching phase, we utilize these probabilities to determine which dimensions will contribute to the accuracy of the recommendation predictions. However, 𝑝 𝑖,𝑗 are characterized by high variance and heavy-tailedness, as shown by the histogram in Figure 3 (left). These present two complications: (1) distinguishing important dimensions from unimportant ones becomes challenging; and (2) even the unimportant dimensions still possess a small probability of being selected. Moreover, masks created using Bernoulli gates introduce an element of randomness (Gumbel noise), which hinders their direct application during inference (where given the same data each time, consistent results should be generated).\nTo overcome these limitations, we propose a deterministic selection mode that directly selects the beneficial dimensions using the knowledge derived from the well-trained Bernoulli probabilities. This process is outlined in Figure 2 (bottom left). Firstly, we use the same FC layer and sigmoid layer to estimate the Bernoulli probabilities, 𝑝 𝑖,𝑗 , analogous to the first step in the stochastic selection mode.\nThen, for each sample 𝑖, we search a threshold among the probabilities 𝑝 𝑖,𝑗  𝑁 * 𝑗=1 (see details in Section 3.3.3). We automatically adjust the gates to be open for probabilities exceeding this threshold and closed for those falling below it. The resulting embedding masks are utilized during the clustering and retraining phase (see Figure 1). </p><h2>publication_ref</h2> <p>[] </p><h2>figure_ref</h2> <p>['fig_2', 'fig_1', 'fig_0'] </p><h2>table_ref</h2> <p>[] </p><h2>heading</h2> <p>Polarization and Automatic Threshold </p><h2>text</h2> <p>Searcher.
