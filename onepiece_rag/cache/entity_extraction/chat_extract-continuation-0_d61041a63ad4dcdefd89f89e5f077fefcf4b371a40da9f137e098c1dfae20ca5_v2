However, it should be noted that the last release time ordering π is actually unknown since R k,h is unknown. Therefore, we have to apply Lemma 7 for such cases to obtain the worst-case release time ordering, i.e., the k -1 higher-priority tasks are ordered in a non-increasing order of their periods.\nLemma 8. Suppose that\nk-1 i=1 U i ≤ 1.\nThen, for any h ≥ 1 and C k > 0, we have\nR k,h ≤ hC k + k-1 i=1 C i - k-1 i=1 U i ( k-1 =i C ) 1 - k-1 i=1 U i , (28\n)\nwhere the k -1 higher-priority tasks are ordered in a nonincreasing order of their periods.\nProof: This comes from the above discussions with α i = 1, β i = 1 by applying Lemmas 6 and 7 when\nk-1 i=1 U i < 1. The case when k-1 i=1 U i = 1 has a safe upper bound R k,h = ∞ in Eq. (28). Theorem 4. Suppose that k i=1 U i ≤ 1. The worst-case response time of task τ k is at most R k ≤ C k + k-1 i=1 C i - k-1 i=1 U i ( k-1 =i C ) 1 - k-1 i=1 U i , (29\n)\nwhere the k -1 higher-priority tasks are ordered in a nonincreasing order of their periods.\nProof: This can be proved by showing that R k,h -(h -1)T k is maximized when h is 1, where R k,h is derived by using Lemma 8. The first-order derivative of R k,h -(h -1)T k with respect to h is\nC k 1-k-1 i=1 Ui -T k = C k -(1-k-1 i=1 Ui)T k 1-k-1 i=1 Ui\n. There are two cases:\nCase 1: If k i=1 U i < 1, then C k -(1-k-1 i=1 Ui)T k 1-k-1 i=1 Ui < C k -U k T k 1-k-1 i=1 Ui = 0. Therefore, R k,h -(h -1)\nT k is a decreasing function of h. Therefore, the response time is maximized when h is 1.\nCase 2: If k i=1 U i = 1, then we know that C k -(1-k-1 i=1 Ui)T k 1-k-1 i=1 Ui = 0. Therefore, R k,h -(h -1)T k remains the same regardless of h.\nTherefore, for both cases, the worst-case response time of task τ k can be safely bounded by Eq. ( 29). Moreover, since the worst case happens when h = 1, we do not have to check the length of the busy window, and we reach our conclusion.\nCorollary 1. Task τ k in a sporadic task system is schedulable by the fixed-priority scheduling algorithm if\nk i=1 U i ≤ 1 and C k D k ≤ 1 - k-1 i=1 U i - k-1 i=1 C i D k + k-1 i=1 U i ( k-1 =i C ) D k ,(30)\nwhere the k -1 higher-priority tasks are ordered in a nonincreasing order of their periods. </p><h2>publication_ref</h2> <p>['b33', 'b33', 'b21', 'b19'] </p><h2>figure_ref</h2> <p>[] </p><h2>table_ref</h2> <p>[] </p><h2>heading</h2> <p>Remarks: </p><h2>text</h2> <p>The utilization-based worst-case response-time analysis in Theorem 4 is analytically tighter than the best known result, R k ≤\nC k + k-1 i=1 Ci-k-1 i=1 UiCi 1-k-1 i=1 Ui\n, by Bini et al.

However, calculating the utilization bound for non-integer ∆ is done asymptotically for k = ∞ with a complicated analysis. </p><h2>publication_ref</h2> <p>['b13', 'b33', 'b33', 'b38', 'b33'] </p><h2>figure_ref</h2> <p>[] </p><h2>table_ref</h2> <p>[] </p><h2>heading</h2> <p>Multiprocessor Implicit-Deadline Systems </p><h2>text</h2> <p>We now\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>WORST-CASE RESPONSE TIME<|>CONCEPT<|>The worst-case response time is a measure used in scheduling theory to determine the maximum time a task may take to complete under the worst conditions, particularly in sporadic task systems.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SPORADIC TASK SYSTEM<|>CONCEPT<|>A sporadic task system is a type of scheduling model where tasks are released at irregular intervals, and each task has a minimum inter-arrival time.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>FIXED-PRIORITY SCHEDULING<|>CONCEPT<|>Fixed-priority scheduling is a scheduling algorithm where tasks are assigned fixed priorities, and tasks with higher priorities are executed before those with lower priorities.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>UTILIZATION BOUND<|>CONCEPT<|>The utilization bound is a theoretical limit on the total CPU utilization that can be achieved by a set of tasks in a scheduling system without missing deadlines.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>THEOREM 4<|>EVENT<|>Theorem 4 provides a mathematical framework for analyzing the schedulability of tasks in a sporadic task system under fixed-priority scheduling.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LEMMA 7<|>EVENT<|>Lemma 7 is a supporting statement used in the analysis of scheduling tasks, particularly in determining worst-case scenarios for task release times.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LEMMA 8<|>EVENT<|>Lemma 8 provides conditions under which the worst-case response time of a task can be bounded, contributing to the overall analysis of task scheduling.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BINI ET AL.<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Bini et al. is a reference to a group of researchers who have contributed to the field of scheduling theory, particularly in the analysis of response times.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LEHOCZKY<|>PERSON<|>Lehoczky is a researcher known for contributions to the analysis of scheduling algorithms, particularly in relation to utilization bounds in real-time systems.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LIU AND LAYLAND<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Liu and Layland are researchers who developed foundational theories in real-time scheduling, particularly regarding task utilization and deadlines.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MAXIMUM INTER-ARRIVAL TIME<|>CONCEPT<|>The maximum inter-arrival time is the longest duration between the arrivals of consecutive tasks in a sporadic task system, influencing scheduling decisions.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>WORST-CASE RESPONSE TIME<|>THEOREM 4<|>Theorem 4 provides a mathematical framework for determining the worst-case response time in sporadic task systems<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SPORADIC TASK SYSTEM<|>FIXED-PRIORITY SCHEDULING<|>Fixed-priority scheduling is a method used to manage sporadic task systems effectively<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>UTILIZATION BOUND<|>WORST-CASE RESPONSE TIME<|>The utilization bound is a critical factor in calculating the worst-case response time for tasks<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>LEMMA 7<|>THEOREM 4<|>Lemma 7 supports the analysis presented in Theorem 4 regarding worst-case response times<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>LEMMA 8<|>THEOREM 4<|>Lemma 8 provides conditions that are essential for the proofs in Theorem 4<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BINI ET AL.<|>WORST-CASE RESPONSE TIME<|>Bini et al. provided a comparative analysis of worst-case response times in scheduling theory<|>4)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>LEHOCZKY<|>UTILIZATION BOUND<|>Lehoczky's work includes contributions to understanding utilization bounds in scheduling systems<|>4)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>LIU AND LAYLAND<|>WORST-CASE RESPONSE TIME<|>Liu and Layland's theories are foundational to the analysis of worst-case response times in real-time systems<|>4)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
