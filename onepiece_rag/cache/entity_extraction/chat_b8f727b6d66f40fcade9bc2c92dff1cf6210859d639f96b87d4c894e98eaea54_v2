Response-time for constrained-deadline task systems: Suppose that R k is the exact worst-case response 2 Since t i is an integer multiple of T i , the property\nt i T i C i = t i U i holds.\ntime for task τ k and R k ≤ T k under uniprocessor fixed-priority scheduling. That is, by Eq. (1),\nC k + τi∈hp(τ k ) t Ti C i > t for any 0 < t < R k and C k + τi∈hp(τ k ) R k Ti C i = R k .\nSimilar to Example 1, let |hp(τ k )| be k -1 and the tasks in hp(τ k ) be ordered by ( R k Ti -1)T i non-decreasingly, i.e.,\nt 1 ≤ t 2 ≤ • • • ≤ t k-1 ≤ R k . With the same analysis in Example 1, we know that C k + k-1 i=1 t i U i + j-1 i=1 C i > t j for j = 1, 2, . . . , k -1 and R k ≤ C k + k-1 i=1 t i U i + k-1 i=1 C i .\nAs a result, by the specific index rule of the tasks in hp(τ k ) and setting α i = 1 and β i = 1 for every task τ i in hp(τ k ), we reach a concrete example for Definition 3.<h2>publication_ref</h2>[]<h2>figure_ref</h2>[]<h2>table_ref</h2>[]<h2>heading</h2>Important Notes<h2>text</h2>Before presenting the analyses based on Definition 2 and Definition 3, we would like to first explain the important assumptions and the flow to use the analytical results. Throughout the paper, we implicitly assume that t k > 0 when Definition 2 is used. Moreover, we only consider non-trivial cases, in which C k > 0 and 0 < U i ≤ 1 for i = 1, 2, . . . , k-1. The definition of t k depends on how Definition 2 is constructed based on the original schedulability test, usually equal to the length of the interval (of the points to be tested in the original schedulability test), e.g., t k = T k = D k in Example 1. In most of the cases, we can set t k as D k . But, it can also be set to other cases, to be demonstrated in Appendix C for global RM scheduling.\nIn Definition 2, the k-point last-release schedulability test is a sufficient schedulability test that tests only k time points, defined by the k-1 higher-priority tasks and task τ k . Similarly, in Definition 3, a k-point last-release response time analysis provides a safe response time by only testing whether task τ k has already finished earlier at k -1 points, each defined by a higher-priority task.\nIn both cases in Definitions 2 and 3, the last release time ordering π is assumed to be given. In some cases, this ordering can be easily obtained. For such cases, all the lemmas in this section can be directly adopted. However, in most of the cases in our demonstrated task models, we have to test all possible last release time orderings and take the worst case. Fortunately, we will show that finding the worst-case ordering is not a difficult problem, which requires to sort the k -1 higherpriority tasks under a simple criteria, in Lemmas 2 and 7. Therefore, for such cases, the lemmas in this section have to be adopted by combining with Lemma 2 or 7.\nWe first assume that the corresponding coefficients α i and β i in Definitions 2 and 3 are given. How to derive them will be discussed in the following sections. Clearly their values are highly dependent upon the task models and the scheduling policies. Provided that these coefficients α i , β i , C i , U i for every higher-priority task τ i ∈ hp(τ k ) are given, we analyze (1) the response time by finding the extreme case for a given C k (under Definition 3), or (2) the schedulability by finding the extreme case for a given C k and D k . Therefore, the k 2 Q framework provides utilization-based schedulability analyses and response time analyses automatically if the corresponding parameters α i and β i can be defined to ensure that the tests in Definitions 2 and 3 are safe.\nk 2 Q can be used by a wide range of applications, as Demonstrated Applications:\nSec. 5: Arbitrary-deadline sporadic tasks\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}}
