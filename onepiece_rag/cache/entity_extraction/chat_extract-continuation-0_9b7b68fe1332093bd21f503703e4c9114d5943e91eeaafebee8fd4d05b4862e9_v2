To that end, we provide a refined Defects4J benchmark for APR targeting bug reports. Bugs are carefully linked with the corresponding bug reports, and for each bug we are able to dissociate future test cases that were introduced after the relevant fixes. Overall, experimental results show that there are promising research directions to further investigate towards the integration of automatic patch generation in actual software development cycles. In particular, our findings suggest that IR-based fault localization errors lead less to overfitting patches than spectrum-based fault localization errors. Furthermore, iFixR offers provides comparable results to most state-of-the-art APR tools, although it is run under the constraint that post-fix knowledge (i.e., future test cases) is not available. Finally, iFixR's prioritization strategy tends to place more correct/plausible patches on top of the recommendation list. </p><h2>publication_ref</h2> <p>['b1', 'b65'] </p><h2>figure_ref</h2> <p>[] </p><h2>table_ref</h2> <p>[] </p><h2>heading</h2> <p>MOTIVATION </p><h2>text</h2> <p>We motivate our work by revisiting two essential steps in APR:\n(1) During fault localization, relevant program entities are identified as suspicious locations that must be changed. Commonly, stateof-the-art APR tools leverage spectrum-based fault localization (SBFL) [12,25,32,33,39,50,52,53,62,65,83,92,93], which uses execution coverage information of passing and failing test cases to predict buggy statements. We dissect the construction of the Defects4J dataset to highlight the practical challenges of fault localization for user-reported bugs. (2) Once a patch candidate is generated, the patch validation step ensures that it is actually relevant for repairing the program. Currently, widespread test-based APR techniques use test suites as the repair oracle. This however is challenged by the incompleteness of test suites, and may further not be inline with developer requirements/expectations in the repair process. </p><h2>publication_ref</h2> <p>['b11', 'b24', 'b31', 'b32', 'b38', 'b49', 'b51', 'b52', 'b61', 'b64', 'b82', 'b91', 'b92'] </p><h2>figure_ref</h2> <p>[] </p><h2>table_ref</h2> <p>[] </p><h2>heading</h2> <p>Fault Localization Challenges </p><h2>text</h2> <p>Defects4J is a manual curated dataset widely used in the APR literature [12,18,73,84,90,91]. Since Defects4J was not initially built for APR, the real order of precedence between the bug report, the patch and the test case is being overlooked by the dataset users. Indeed, Defects4J offers a user-friendly way of checking out buggy versions of programs with all relevant test cases for readily benchmarking test-based systems. We propose to carefully examine the actual bug fix commits associated with Defects4J bugs and study how the test suite is evolved. Table 1 provides detailed information. Overall, for 96%(=381/395) bugs, the relevant test cases are actually future data with respect to the bug discovery process. This finding suggests that, in practice, even the fault localization may be challenged in the case of user-reported bugs, given the lack of relevant test cases. The statistics listed in Table 2 indeed shows that if future test cases are dropped, no test case is failing when executing buggy program versions for 365 (i.e., 92%) bugs. In the APR literature, fault localization is generally performed using the GZoltar [11] testing framework and a SBFL formula [88] (e.g., Ochiai [2]). To support our discussions, we attempt to perform fault localization without the future test cases to evaluate the performance gap. Experimental results (see details forward in Table 6 of Section 5) expectedly reveal that the majority of the Defects4J bugs (i.e., 375/395) cannot be localized by SBFL at the time the bug is reported by users.\nIt is necessary to investigate alternate fault localization approaches that build on bug report information since relevant test cases are often unavailable when users report bugs.
