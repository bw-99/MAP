A sporadic task τ i is released repeatedly, with each such invocation called a job. The j th job of τ i , denoted τ i,j , is released at time r i,j and has an absolute deadline at time d i,j . Each job of any task τ i is assumed to have execution time C i . Here in this paper, whenever we refer to the execution time of a job, we mean for the worst-case execution time of the job, since all the analyses we use are safe by only considering the worst-case execution time. The response time of a job is defined as its finishing time minus its release time. Successive jobs of the same task are required to be executed in sequence. Associated with each task τ i are a period T i , which specifies the minimum time between two consecutive job releases of τ i , and a deadline D i , which specifies the relative deadline of each such job, i.e., d i,j = r i,j + D i . The worst-case response time of a task τ i is the maximum response time among all its jobs. The utilization of a task τ i is defined as\nU i = C i /T i .\nA sporadic task system τ is an implicit-deadline system if D i = T i holds for each τ i . A sporadic task system τ is a constrained-deadline system if D i ≤ T i holds for each τ i . Otherwise, such a sporadic task system τ is an arbitrarydeadline system.\nA task is said schedulable by a scheduling policy if all of its jobs can finish before their absolute deadlines, i.e., the worst-case response time of the task is no more than its relative deadline. A task system is said schedulable by a scheduling policy if all the tasks in the task system are schedulable. A schedulability test expresses sufficient schedulability conditions to ensure the feasibility of the resulting schedule by a scheduling policy.\nThroughout the paper, we will focus on fixed-priority preemptive scheduling. That is, each task is associated with a priority level (except in Appendix F). For a uniprocessor system, the scheduler always dispatches the job with the highest priority in the ready queue to be executed. For a multiprocessor system, we consider multiprocessor global scheduling on M identical processors, in which each of them has the same computation power. For global multiprocessor scheduling, there is a global queue and a global scheduler to dispatch the jobs. We consider only global fixed-priority scheduling. At any time, the M -highest-priority jobs in the ready queue are dispatched and executed on these M processors.\nNote that the framework is not only limited to the above task and platform models. These terminologies are introduced only for the simplicity of presentation and illustrating some examples. </p><h2>publication_ref</h2> <p>[] </p><h2>figure_ref</h2> <p>[] </p><h2>table_ref</h2> <p>[] </p><h2>heading</h2> <p>Speed-Up Factor and Capacity Augmentation Factor: </p><h2>text</h2> <p>To quantify the error of the schedulability tests or the scheduling policies, the concept of resource augmentation by using speedup factors [43] and the capacity augmentation factors [36] has been adopted. For example, global DM in general does not have good utilization bounds to schedule a set of sporadic tasks on M identical processors, due to \"Dhall's effect\" [26]. However, if we constrain the total utilization τi Ci M Ti ≤ 1 b , the density\nC k + τ i ∈hp(τ k ) Ci M D k ≤ 1\nb for each task τ k , and the maximum utilization max τi Ci min{Ti,Di} ≤ 1 b , it is possible to provide the schedulability guarantee of global RM by setting b to 3-1 M [2], [4], [10]. Such a factor b has been recently named as a capacity augmentation factor [36]. Note that the capacity augmentation bound was defined without taking this simple condition\nC k + τ i ∈hp(τ k ) Ci M D k ≤ 1\nb in [36], as they focus on implicit-deadline systems. For constrained-deadline systems, adding such a new constraint is a natural extension.\nAn algorithm A is with speed-up factor b: If there exists a feasible schedule for the task system, it is schedulable by algorithm A by speeding up (each processor) to b times as fast as in the original platform (speed). A sufficient schedulability test for scheduling algorithm A is with speed-up factor b: If the task system cannot pass the sufficient schedulability test, the task set is not schedulable by any scheduling algorithm if (each processor) is slowed down to 1 b times of the original platform speed. Note that if the capacity augmentation factor is b, the speed-up factor is also upper-bounded by b. </p><h2>publication_ref</h2> <p>['b42', 'b35', 'b25', 'b3', 'b9', 'b35', 'b35'] </p><h2>figure_ref</h2> <p>[] </p><h2>table_ref</h2> <p>[] </p><h2>heading</h2> <p>Analysis Flow </p><h2>text</h2> <p>The framework focuses on testing the schedulability and the response time for a task τ k , under the assumption that the required properties (i.e., worst-case response time or the schedulability) of the higher-priority tasks are already verified and provided\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}}
