For any two distinct nodes v x and v y , there are (n-2) nodes other than v x and v y in graph G on . These (n -2) nodes can be split into the four sets N xy , N xy , N xy and N x y as follows. Let N xy be the set of nodes that are neighbors of both v x and v y ; i.e., N xy = N x ‚à© N y . Let N xy denote the set of nodes in V \\ v x , v y  that are neighbors of v x , but are not neighbors of v y . Similarly, N xy is defined as the set of nodes in V \\ v x , v y  that are not neighbors of v x , but are neighbors of v y .
