We first generated a set of sporadic tasks. The cardinality of the task set was 5 times the number of processors, i.e., 40 tasks on 8 multiprocessor systems. The UUniFast-Discard method [23] was adopted to generate a set of utilization values with the given goal. We used the approach suggested by Davis et al. [25] to generate the task periods according to a uniform distribution in the range of the logarithm of the task periods (i.e., log-uniform distribution). The order of magnitude p to control the period values between the largest and smallest periods is parameterized in evaluations, (e.g., 1 -10ms for p = 1, 1 -100ms for p = 2, etc.). We evaluate these tests in uniprocessor systems with p ∈ [1,2,3]. The execution time was set accordingly, i.e., C i = T i U i . Tasks' relative deadlines were equal to their periods.\nThe evaluated tests for n tasks in T with n ≥ M are:\n• BCL: the linear-time test in Theorem 4 in [11].\n• FF: the pseudo-polynomial-time forced-forward (FF) analysis in Eq. ( 5) in [7]. • BAK: the O(n 3 ) test in Theorem 11 in [5].\n• Guan: the pseudo-polynomial-time response time analysis [29]. 34) in Theorem 5. This requires to sort the higher-priority tasks to define the proper last release ordering and the M -1 carry-in jobs; therefore, the time complexity is O(n 2 log n) for a task set with n tasks. • QB-BC2 (from k 2 Q): Eq. ( 34) in Theorem 6 by always using the worst-case release time ordering, which is the reverse order of the given priority assignment. The schedulability test can be implemented in O(n log M ) time complexity by using proper data structures, provided that the RM priority order is given. 6   Figure 2 depicts the result of the performance comparison. In all the cases, we can see that QB-BC is superior to all the other polynomial-time tests. QB-BC2 is slightly worse than QB-BC but the time complexity is lower. Since QB-BC and QB-BC2 are designed from a more pessimistic test than the analysis by Guan et al. [29] in pseudo-polynomial time, they are worse. But, we note that there is a significant gap in time complexity between QB-BC, QB-BC2, and Guan. Overall, the tests derived by using the k 2 Q framework perform reasonably well with their low time complexity.\n• QB-BC (from k 2 Q): Eq.

Thanks to the independence upon the task and platform models in the framework, k 2 Q can be viewed as a \"block-box\" interface that can result in sufficient utilization-based analyses for a wide range of applications in real-time systems under fixedpriority scheduling. We believe that the k 2 Q framework has high potential to be adopted to solve several other problems for analyzing other task models in real-time systems with fixedpriority scheduling. The framework can be used, once the 6 The time complexity is mainly due to the calculation of T to get the M -1 tasks with the maximum carry-in execution time since the other operations can be done in O(1) time complexity by using proper data structures to calculate the values when we intend to test task τ k+1 after task τ k . Specifically, due to the predefined last release time ordering, when we intend to test task τ k+1 after task τ k , we only have to insert task τ k to be indexed as 1 and updating\nfrom k-1 i=1 (U i k-1 =i C ) M 2 T k to k i=1 (U i k =i C ) M 2 T k\n(under the new ordering) takes only constant time complexity. Finding task set T can be implemented by using a min heap to store the M -1 tasks in T . When we move from testing task τ k (when k ≥ M ) to task τ k+1 , we need to compare whether C k is larger than the minimum execution time of the tasks in the heap. If no, we keep the same task set T ; if yes, we pop out the task with the minimum execution time in the heap, and insert task τ k into the heap. By using the heap, this operation requires time complexity O(log M ). Calculating C k+1 from C k with the help of the heap can be done\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}}
