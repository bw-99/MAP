(122\n)\nWe now explain why the one-law (12) follows from Lemma 5. Consider p n , K n and P n such that (118) and (119) hold. Comparing ( 9) and (120), we get\nβ ℓ,n = (k -1 -ℓ) ln ln n + α n . (123\n)\nSince α n = o(ln n) and lim n→∞ α n = +∞, we have for each ℓ = 0, 1, . . . , k -1 that\nlim n→∞ β ℓ,n = +∞ and β ℓ,n = o(ln n).(124)\nGiven (124), we use Lemma 5 and obtain\nlim n→∞ P [κ = ℓ] = 0, ℓ = 0, 1, . . . , k -1.\nFor any constant k, this implies lim n→∞ P [κ ≥ k] = 1, or equivalently\nlim n→∞ P [G on is k-connected ] = 1.\nThis completes the proof of the one-law (12). The remaining part of this section is devoted to the proof of Lemma 5. Proof. We present the steps of proving Lemma 5 below. First, by a crude bounding argument, we get\nP [κ = ℓ] ≤ P [(κ = ℓ) ∩ (δ > ℓ)] + P [δ ≤ ℓ] ,\nwhere δ is the minimum node degree of graph G on , as defined in Section V-D. We will prove Lemma 5 by establishing the following two results under the enforced assumptions:\nlim n→∞ P [δ ≤ ℓ] = 0 if lim n→∞ β ℓ,n = +∞,(125)\nand\nlim n→∞ P [κ = ℓ ∩ δ > ℓ] = 0 if lim n→∞ β ℓ,n = +∞.(126)\nWe first establish (125). First, from ℓ ln ln n = o(ln n), β ℓ,n = o(ln n) and p e = ln n+ℓ ln ln n+β ℓ,n n\n, it is clear that p e ∼ ln n n . Then p e = o 1 √ n . Thus, from Lemmas 1 and 2, we get\nE X ℓ = nP [D x,ℓ ] ∼ n • (ℓ!) -1 (p e n) ℓ e -pen .(127)\nSubstituting p e ∼ ln n n and (120) into (127), we get\nE X ℓ ∼ n (ℓ!) -1 (ln n) ℓ e -ln n-ℓ ln ln n-β ℓ,n = (ℓ!) -1 e -β ℓ,n .\nIn view of the fact that lim n→∞ β ℓ,n = +∞, we thus obtain E X ℓ = o(1). Then from property (a) of Fact 1 (Section V-C), we get\nlim n→∞ P[δ = ℓ] = 0.(128)\nAs seen from ( 121), β ℓ,n is decreasing in ℓ. Thus, we have\nlim n→∞ β ℓ ⋆ ,n = +∞ for each ℓ ⋆ = 0, 1, . . . , ℓ. It is also im- mediate from (121) that β ℓ ⋆ ,n = o(ln n) since β ℓ,n = o(ln n).\nTherefore, using the same arguments that lead to (128), we obtain\nlim n→∞ P[δ = ℓ ⋆ ] = 0, ℓ ⋆ = 0, 1, . . . , ℓ,\nand (125) follows immediately. As ( 125) is established, it remains to prove (126) in order to complete the proof of Lemma 5. The basic idea in establishing ( 126) is to find a sufficiently tight upper bound on the probability P [κ = ℓ ∩ δ > ℓ] and then to show that this bound tends to zero as n goes to +∞. This approach is similar to the one used for proving the one-law for k-connectivity in Erdős-Rényi graphs [12], as well as to the approach used by Yagan [37] to establish the one-law for connectivity in the graph G on .\nWe start by obtaining the needed upper bound. Let N denote the collection of all non-empty subsets of {v 1 , . . . , v n }. We define\nN * = {T | T ∈ N , |T | ≥ 2} and K T = ∪ vi∈T S i .\nFor the reasons that will later become apparent we find it useful to introduce the event E(J ) in the following manner:\nE(J ) = T ∈N * |K T | ≤ J |T | ,(129)\nwhere J = [J 2 , J 3 , . . . , J n ] is an (n -1)-dimensional integer valued array. Let\nr n := min P n K n , n 2 . (130\n)\nWe define J i as follows:\nJ i = max{⌊(1 + ε)K n ⌋ , ⌊λK n i⌋} i = 2, . . . , r n\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>LEMMA 5<|>CONCEPT<|>Lemma 5 is a mathematical statement that is being proved in the context of graph theory, specifically related to the connectivity of graphs as n approaches infinity.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ONE-LAW<|>CONCEPT<|>The one-law refers to a theorem in graph theory that describes the behavior of certain properties of graphs as the number of vertices approaches infinity.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GRAPH G<|>CONCEPT<|>Graph G is a mathematical structure consisting of vertices and edges, which is being analyzed for its connectivity properties in the context of the proof.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ERDŐS-RÉNYI GRAPHS<|>CONCEPT<|>Erdős-Rényi graphs are a type of random graph used in probability theory and combinatorics, often referenced in discussions of graph connectivity.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PROOF<|>EVENT<|>The proof is a logical argument that establishes the truth of the one-law and Lemma 5 through a series of mathematical steps and results.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>P[κ = ℓ]<|>CONCEPT<|>P[κ = ℓ] represents the probability that a certain property κ of the graph equals ℓ, which is a key focus in the analysis of graph connectivity.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>P[δ ≤ ℓ]<|>CONCEPT<|>P[δ ≤ ℓ] denotes the probability that the minimum node degree δ of graph G is less than or equal to ℓ, which is relevant to the proof of Lemma 5.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>P[κ ≥ k]<|>CONCEPT<|>P[κ ≥ k] indicates the probability that the property κ of the graph is greater than or equal to k, which is derived from the one-law.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>β ℓ,n<|>CONCEPT<|>β ℓ,n is a mathematical expression that relates to the behavior of certain parameters in the graph as n approaches infinity.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>α n<|>CONCEPT<|>α n is a sequence that approaches infinity and is used in the context of the proof to analyze the behavior of the graph's properties.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>LEMMA 5<|>ONE-LAW<|>Lemma 5 is a foundational component in proving the one-law, establishing key results about graph connectivity<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ONE-LAW<|>GRAPH G<|>The one-law describes the connectivity properties of graph G as the number of vertices approaches infinity<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>GRAPH G<|>ERDŐS-RÉNYI GRAPHS<|>The analysis of graph G's connectivity is similar to the properties observed in Erdős-Rényi graphs<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PROOF<|>LEMMA 5<|>The proof is the process of demonstrating the validity of Lemma 5<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>P[κ = ℓ]<|>ONE-LAW<|>The probability P[κ = ℓ] is a critical part of the one-law's formulation regarding graph properties<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>P[δ ≤ ℓ]<|>LEMMA 5<|>The probability P[δ ≤ ℓ] is used in the proof of Lemma 5 to establish limits on node degrees<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>P[κ ≥ k]<|>ONE-LAW<|>The probability P[κ ≥ k] is derived from the one-law, indicating the likelihood of certain connectivity properties<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>β ℓ,n<|>P[κ = ℓ]<|>The behavior of β ℓ,n influences the probability P[κ = ℓ] as n approaches infinity<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>α n<|>P[κ = ℓ]<|>The sequence α n is relevant in determining the limits of probabilities like P[κ = ℓ] in the context of the proof<|>5)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
