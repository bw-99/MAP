ESTABLISHING (12) (THE ONE-LAW </p><h2>text</h2> <p>FOR k-CONNECTIVITY IN G on )\nAs shown in Section V-B, we can enforce the extra condition Œ± n = o(ln n) in establishing (12) (i.e., the one-law for kconnectivity in G on ). Therefore, we will establish (12) under the following conditions: (9), K n ‚â• 2 for all n sufficiently large , P n = ‚Ñ¶(n), (118)\nK n P n = o(1), lim n‚Üí‚àû Œ± n = +‚àû and Œ± n = o(ln n).(119)\nIn graph G on , consider scalings K, P : N 0 ‚Üí N 0 and p : N 0 ‚Üí (0, 1) as in Theorem 1. We find it useful to define a sequence Œ≤ ‚Ñì,n : N √ó N 0 ‚Üí R through the relation\np e = ln n + ‚Ñì ln ln n + Œ≤ ‚Ñì,n n(120)\nfor each n ‚àà N 0 and each ‚Ñì ‚àà N. (120) follows by just setting\nŒ≤ ‚Ñì,n := np e -ln n -‚Ñì ln ln n. (121\n)\nThe one-law (12) will follow from the next key result. Recall that, as defined in Section V-D, Œ∫ is the connectivity of the graph G on , namely the minimum number nodes whose deletion makes it disconnected.\nLemma 5. Let ‚Ñì be a non-negative constant integer. If K n ‚â• 2 for any sufficiently large n, P n = ‚Ñ¶(n), Kn Pn = o(1), and (120) holds with Œ≤ ‚Ñì,n = o(ln n) and lim n‚Üí‚àû Œ≤ ‚Ñì,n = +‚àû, then\nlim n‚Üí‚àû P [Œ∫ = ‚Ñì] = 0. (122\n)\nWe now explain why the one-law (12) follows from Lemma 5. Consider p n , K n and P n such that (118) and (119) hold. Comparing ( 9) and (120), we get\nŒ≤ ‚Ñì,n = (k -1 -‚Ñì) ln ln n + Œ± n . (123\n)\nSince Œ± n = o(ln n) and lim n‚Üí‚àû Œ± n = +‚àû, we have for each ‚Ñì = 0, 1, . . . , k -1 that\nlim n‚Üí‚àû Œ≤ ‚Ñì,n = +‚àû and Œ≤ ‚Ñì,n = o(ln n).(124)\nGiven (124), we use Lemma 5 and obtain\nlim n‚Üí‚àû P [Œ∫ = ‚Ñì] = 0, ‚Ñì = 0, 1, . . . , k -1.\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>PROPOSITION 2<|>concept<|>Proposition 2 is a mathematical statement that has been established in the context of the text, likely related to probabilities and graph theory.)\n(\"entity\"<|>PROPOSITION 1<|>concept<|>Proposition 1 is another mathematical statement established in the text, serving as a foundation for further proofs.)\n(\"entity\"<|>LEMMA 3<|>concept<|>Lemma 3 is a supporting statement in the mathematical context of the text, which is proven following the establishment of Propositions 1 and 2.)\n(\"entity\"<|>GRAPH G<|>concept<|>Graph G is a structure being analyzed in the context of k-connectivity, where the connectivity of the graph is defined.)\n(\"entity\"<|>CONNECTIVITY<|>concept<|>Connectivity refers to the minimum number of nodes whose removal would disconnect the graph, a key concept in graph theory.)\n(\"entity\"<|>SCALINGS<|>concept<|>Scalings K, P are functions defined in the context of the graph G, influencing its properties and behavior.)\n(\"entity\"<|>B H<|>concept<|>B H is a specific event or condition defined in the context of the probabilities being calculated in the text.)\n(\"entity\"<|>E XY<|>concept<|>E XY is another event related to the probabilities discussed, likely involving intersections of certain sets.)\n(\"entity\"<|>R.H.S.<|>concept<|>R.H.S. refers to the right-hand side of an equation, which is being evaluated and compared in the text.)\n(\"entity\"<|>ONE-LAW<|>concept<|>The one-law refers to a specific theorem or result regarding k-connectivity in graph G, which is being established in the text.)\n(\"relationship\"<|>PROPOSITION 1<|>PROPOSITION 2<|>Proposition 2 builds upon the foundation established by Proposition 1 in the context of the proofs<|>8)\n(\"relationship\"<|>PROPOSITION 2<|>LEMMA 3<|>Lemma 3 is proven following the establishment of Propositions 1 and 2, indicating a logical progression<|>7)\n(\"relationship\"<|>GRAPH G<|>CONNECTIVITY<|>The connectivity of graph G is a key property being analyzed in the context of the text<|>9)\n(\"relationship\"<|>SCALINGS<|>GRAPH G<|>The scalings K and P are defined in relation to the properties of graph G<|>6)\n(\"relationship\"<|>B H<|>E XY<|>B H and E XY are events whose probabilities are being calculated and compared in the text<|>7)\n(\"relationship\"<|>R.H.S.<|>B H<|>The right-hand side of the equation involves the event B H, indicating a relationship in the calculations<|>6)\n(\"relationship\"<|>ONE-LAW<|>GRAPH G<|>The one-law is a result that pertains to the properties of graph G, specifically regarding its k-connectivity<|>8)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
