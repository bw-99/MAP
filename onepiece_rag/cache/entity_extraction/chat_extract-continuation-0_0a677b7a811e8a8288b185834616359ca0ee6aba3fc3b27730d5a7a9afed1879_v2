For a given k-point last-release schedulability test of a scheduling algorithm, with the properties in Definition 4, task τ k is schedulable by the scheduling algorithm if\nk-1 i=1 Ui ≤ k -1 k   α + β -(α + β) 2 -2αβ(1 -C k t k ) k k-1 αβ   .(18)\nProof: This can be formally proved by using the Lagrange Multiplier Method. However, it can also be proved by using a simpler mathematical observation. Suppose that x = k-1 i=1 U i is given. For given α, β, and x, we know that Eq. ( 17) becomes 1 -\n(α + β)x + 0.5αβ(x 2 + k-1 i=1 U 2 i ). That is, only the last term 0.5αβ( k-1 i=1 U 2 i ) depends on how U i values are actually assigned. Moreover, k-1 i=1 U 2 i is a well-known convex function with respect to U 1 , U 2 , . . . , U k-1 . That is, ρU 2 i + (1 -ρ)U 2 j ≥ (ρU i + (1 -ρ)U j ) 2 for any 0 ≤ ρ ≤ 1.\nTherefore,\nk-1 i=1 U 2 i is minimized when U 1 = U 2 = • • • = U k-1 = x k-1 .\nHence, what we have to do is to find the infimum x such that the condition in Eq. ( 17) does not hold. That is,\ninfimum x s. t. C k t k > 1 -(α + β)x + 0.5αβ x 2 + x 2 k -1 .\nThis means that as long as\nk-1\ni=1 U i is no more than such infimum x, the condition in Eq. ( 17) always holds and the schedulability can be guaranteed. Provided that C k t k is given, we can simply solve the above problem by finding the x with\n0 = 1 -C k t k -(α + β)x + 0.5αβ k k-1 x 2 .\nThere are two roots in the above quadratic equation. The smaller root, i.e., the righthand side of Eq. ( 18), is the infimum by definition.\nLemma 5. For a given k-point last-release schedulability test of a scheduling algorithm, with the properties in Definition 4, provided that α + β ≥ 1, then task τ k is schedulable by the scheduling algorithm if\nC k t k + k-1 i=1 Ui ≤          k-1 k   α + β -(α + β) 2 -2αβ k k-1 αβ   , if k > (α+β) 2 -1 α 2 +β 2 -1 and α 2 + β 2 > 1 1 + (k-1)((α+β-1)-1 2 (α+β) 2 +0.5) kαβ otherwise(19)\nProof: The proof is similar to the proof of Lemma 4, but slightly more involved. We detail the proof in Appendix A.\nBy the fact that\n(α + β) 2 -2αβ k k-1 = (α + β) 2 -2αβ -2αβ 1 k-1\n, which is an increasing function with respect to k, and the fact that k-1 k is a decreasing function with respect to k, we know that the right-hand side of Eq. ( 19) (when α 2 + β 2 > 1) decreases with respect to k. Similarly, the right-hand side of Eq. ( 18) also decreases with respect to k. Therefore, for evaluating the utilization bounds, it is alway safe to take k → ∞ as a safe upper bound. The right-hand side of Eq. ( 18) converges to\nα+β-α 2 +β 2 +2αβ C k t k αβ when k → ∞. The right-hand side of Eq. (19) (when α 2 + β 2 > 1) converges to α+β- √ α 2 +β 2 αβ when k → ∞.<h2>publication_ref</h2>[]<h2>figure_ref</h2>[]<h2>table_ref</h2>[]<h2>heading</h2>Response Time Analysis Framework<h2>text</h2>We now further discuss the utilization-based response-time analysis framework.
