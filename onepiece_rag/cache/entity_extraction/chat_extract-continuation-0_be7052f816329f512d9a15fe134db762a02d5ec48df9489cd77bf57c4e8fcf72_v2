Since there is no efficient tool that can fulfill the tasks mentioned in Task Characterization, we chose to compare iQUANT with the widelyused line charts in the stock market. In both designs, the time series of financial factors and stock prices were displayed. Users were required to complete multiple tasks involving the selection of factors and stocks for investment, which corresponded well with T1∼T3 in Task Characterization. In total, 14 expert quantitative traders were recruited as subjects, who were paid for their valuable time. We applied a between-subject design that subjects were randomly assigned to two groups of equal size. The seven subjects in each group will complete all the tasks with only one visualization, iQUANT or baseline. The experiment was composed of two sessions. In the first training session, subjects were presented with a tutorial and allowed a trial usage of iQUANT to be tested. In the subsequent formal test session, each subject took seven tasks. To alleviate the influence of financial data on the result and increase statistical power, we presented two stock data. Each subject was required to complete all the tasks with both data using the tested visualization. The full documents of the experiment design are provided in Appendix A. The user tasks can be categorized into four groups.\nQ1/Q2 (factor selection by contribution): Among all the factors, which factors have the highest positive/negative contribution to the return of a particular stock during a given time period? Q3 (factor selection by stability): Among all the factors, which factors have the highest unstable contribution to the return of a particular stock during a given time period? Q4/Q5 (factor selection by contribution to a sector of stocks): Among all the factors, which factors have the highest positive/negative contribution to the return of all stocks in a particular sector during a given time period? Q6/Q7 (stock selection by factor contribution): Among all the stocks in a given sector, whose return receive the highest positive/negative contribution from a selected factor during a given time period?\nFor each question, the subject was required to provide 1 ∼ 2 answers. Because of the between-subject design, subjects were not asked for their subjective rating on each visualization (no within-subject comparison).
