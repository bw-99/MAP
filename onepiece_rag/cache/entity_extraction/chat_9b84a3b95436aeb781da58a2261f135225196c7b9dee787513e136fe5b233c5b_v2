The tool leverages an end-to-end trainable architecture that couples a BERT-based encoding module with a multi-label classification head to match relevant text passages from sustainability reports to their respective law regulations from the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) standards. We evaluate our model on two novel German sustainability reporting data sets and consistently achieve a significantly higher recommendation performance compared to multiple strong baselines. Furthermore, sustain.AI is publicly available for everyone at https://sustain.ki.nrw/.<h1>sections</h1><h2>heading</h2>INTRODUCTION<h2>text</h2>In the face of climate change and environmental degradation, our society's expectations of sustainable and responsible entrepreneurial action have increased continuously over the past years. Legislators worldwide and particularly in the EU become increasingly aware of the situation and have taken concrete political measures to enforce corporate social responsibility (CSR). In 2014 the EU approved the Non-Financial Reporting Directive (NFRD) which forces large companies to extend their reporting on policies, risks and key performance indicators regarding sustainability and social Figure 1: A screenshot of the sustain.AI recommender tool. After selecting a specific regulatory requirement from one of the categories, the system predicts the most relevant segments of a provided sustainability report. On the right side, the recommended segments are highlighted in the rendered report, fostering an efficient sustainability analysis. matters. Beginning in 2024 the NFRD will be updated with the stricter CSR-Directive, which applies to around 50,000 European companies and includes a wider catalog of reporting requirements covering environmental, social and governance aspects. The majority of these requirements are based on the popular regulatory framework from the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI). Its universal reporting standards provide a detailed set of indicators that address a company's impact on the economy, environment and\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}}
