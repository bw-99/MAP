The portfolio is adjusted in regular time intervals, which is also known as the trading cycle. Depending on the style of traders and funds, the trading cycle can range from one day/week (e.g., private equity) to several months (e.g., public funds). By the factor investing paradigm, at the beginning of each trading cycle, traders pick a few factors based on their experience, domain knowledge, market status and factor returns. Quantitative models are then built up over historical market data, which try to establish linkages between factors and stock returns. Both machine learning and statistical models have been applied in this stage [CG20]. From model-predicted stock returns, traders further apply a trading strategy to determine how to adjust their investment assets, i.e., when and which stocks to buy/sell. Because it is extremely hard to forecast how the portfolio adjustment decision performs in the upcoming trading cycle, a standard backtesting helps to evaluate its returns on historical data. The model consistently earns excess returns to the market, or at least in recent cycles, is considered good in the context of quantitative investment. </p><h2>publication_ref</h2> <p>['b15', 'b0'] </p><h2>figure_ref</h2> <p>[] </p><h2>table_ref</h2> <p>[] </p><h2>heading</h2> <p>Task Characterization </p><h2>text</h2> <p>The factor investing paradigm introduced above seems straightforward. However, due to the closedness of the quantitative investment community, we only came to this understanding after pilot studies with expert traders in several mutual funds, both public and private ones. In the interviews, almost all of them mentioned a key difficulty in the factor investing practice, the selection of valuable factors. While during their long-term jobs, a number of factor combinations proven in the past have been accumulated, they never stop finding and evaluating new factors because stock fluctuations in the future can hardly be entirely the same as the past. In a sense, the ability to discover new factors is the central competence of quantitative traders and accounts for most of their performance difference.\nAs we learned from experts in the interview, the current factor selection process is mostly done manually. A major user pain point lies in that the evaluation of selected factors are indirect, less intuitive, and often requires an exhaustive search in the vast combinatorial factor space to identify the best factor collection. In the standard backtesting of quantitative models, to be able to compute model returns, the learning/statistical algorithm and the focused stock need to be determined in addition to the factor selection. Importantly, these model returns are often the result of interactions among factor, model and stock selections. Users often require a tedious trialand-error comparison process to determine factors. As such a process is done in every trading cycle, efficiency is also a critical consideration not to be neglected. Meanwhile, automatic factor selections by machine learning algorithms (e.g., feature selection) have been incorporated in a trader's job. Due to explainability concerns, these algorithm-picked factors are only used as a starting point or reference for manual factor selection until traders can understand their working mechanism. To this end, interactive factor investing systems that can integrate feature selection, model building, and human intelligence in heuristic factor search, as well as visually explain selected factors are of great demand. Below we summarize key user requirements collected from our expert studies.\nR1. Direct and intuitive factor evaluation. As there are a large number of candidate factors, for a given pool of stocks, the system should recommend an initial factor selection for users to start with (R1.1). Importance measures of these factors should be computed in the context of quantitative models to account for the interaction between factors and models. These factor importance and the performance of underlying stock/model need to be presented comprehensively to allow intuitive factor evaluation (R1.2). </p><h2>publication_ref</h2> <p>[] </p><h2>figure_ref</h2> <p>[] </p><h2>table_ref</h2> <p>[] </p><h2>heading</h2> <p>R2. Interaction support for factor and portfolio selection. </p><h2>text</h2> <p>Based on evaluations of factor and stock performance, the system should support appropriate interaction to help construct stock portfolios to invest. This requires interactions to jointly select and refine factors and stocks, as well as a mechanism to help users understand.\nR3. Integrated model building and backtesting. In the factor selection and evaluation, the system should automatically train quantitative models to predict stock returns based on selected factors and stocks, algorithmically or jointly (R3.1). In factor investing, backtesting of these models should be performed to compare portfolio returns and guide investment decisions (R3.2).\nTo meet the requirements of expert traders, we target to build a visual analytics system that can support the following key tasks.\nT1. Selection of an initial pool of stocks and factors. Traders can start from all the stocks in the market for their investment analysis. More frequently, s/he focuses on a few sectors (per funder's requirements) and picked several stocks from each sector to construct a balanced initial stock portfolio. Our system provides an interface to allow users to manually determine the initial stock portfolio from the list of stocks organized by sectors. Initial factor selections are automatically recommended based on the stock portfolio. (R1.1) T2. Evaluation of factors through visualization.
