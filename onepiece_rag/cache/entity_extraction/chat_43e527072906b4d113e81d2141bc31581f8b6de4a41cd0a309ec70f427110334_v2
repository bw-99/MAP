We show the results on Avazu as an example and exclude all anonymous field features in Figure 5.\nWe can observe that: (i) Each field's optimal dimensions greatly vary from one to another (from 4 to 12), which highlights the necessity of dimension search in recommender systems; (ii) idrelated features, e.g., site_id and app_id, typically possess more dimensions. This aligns with human intuition as the id-related features are the core of recommender systems; (iii) Samples within different clusters tend to select different dimensions for each field, which validates our claim that different clusters present different  patterns and should be trained separately to enhance performance and reduce inference time in Section 3.4. Furthermore, we use four samples to illustrate the effectiveness of the iHAS framework consisting of group-customized recommender models. Figure 6 shows four samples grouped into two clusters (two in pink and two in cyan). Each cluster has its customized recommender model. We can find that the predictions are more correct (lower Logloss) if we feed the sample into its corresponding model. However, if feeding all of them together into one of the recommender models, we will receive some wrong predictions. </p><h2>publication_ref</h2> <p>[] </p><h2>figure_ref</h2> <p>[] </p><h2>table_ref</h2> <p>[] </p><h2>heading</h2> <p>CONCLUSION </p><h2>text</h2> <p>This study proposes an instance-wise Hierarchical Architecture Search framework, iHAS, as an innovative solution to the challenges associated with identifying optimal embedding dimensions for DLRMs. iHAS employs a three-stage hierarchical training strategy including searching, clustering, and retraining. The searching stage aims to identify the optimal embedding dimensions for each sample across different fields. Subsequent stages of clustering and retraining provide a mechanism for gathering similar samples as clusters and training cluster-customized DLRMs based on the individual optimal dimensions, thereby enhancing recommendation predictions. We conduct extensive experiments on two large-scale datasets to authenticate the efficacy of the proposed framework. The results demonstrate that iHAS could boost the performance of deep recommendations while reducing inference costs. Additionally, iHAS exhibits outstanding transferability to popular DLRMs. </p><h2>publication_ref</h2> <p>[] </p><h2>figure_ref</h2> <p>[] </p><h2>table_ref</h2> <p>[] </p>\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}}
