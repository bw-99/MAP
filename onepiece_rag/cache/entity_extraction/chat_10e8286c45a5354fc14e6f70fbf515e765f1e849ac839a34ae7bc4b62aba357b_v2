The detailed optimization strategy in each stage is illustrated in Algorithm 1. [35], the use of Gumbel-Softmax approximation for the discrete random variable suffers from high variance, which can lead to inconsistency in the set of selected dimensions. Inspired by [15], we first pretrain the base recommender model for a few epochs to obtain a tentative reliable embedding representation. During these pretrain epochs, the Bernoulli gates are always deterministically open (no matter what embedding representation it receives). Then, after we've obtained a tentative reliable embedding representation, we initialize the parameters for the Bernoulli gates and start the stochastic selection. Later we adopt the bi-level optimization strategy [12,24] to disjointly update the parameters 𝒘 in Bernoulli gates and the parameters {𝑽, 𝜽 } b in the base recommender model. </p><h2>publication_ref</h2> <p>['b11', 'b14', 'b23', 'b32', 'b34', 'b14', 'b11', 'b23'] </p><h2>figure_ref</h2> <p>[] </p><h2>table_ref</h2> <p>[] </p><h2>heading</h2> <p>Searching Stage. As mentioned in </p><h2>text</h2> <p> </p><h2>publication_ref</h2> <p>[] </p><h2>figure_ref</h2> <p>[] </p><h2>table_ref</h2> <p>[] </p><h2>heading</h2> <p>Clustering Stage. </p><h2>text</h2> <p>In the clustering stage, we can obtain the masked embedding representations using the embedding tables and Bernoulli gates which have been trained during the searching stage. Remember we use deterministic selection mode for Bernoulli gates to generate embedding masks in this clustering stage. For each sample, compute its Euclidean distance to the centroid using the masked embedding representations, then assign it to the nearest centroid (group), and later update the centroids. </p><h2>publication_ref</h2> <p>[] </p><h2>figure_ref</h2> <p>[] </p><h2>table_ref</h2> <p>[] </p><h2>heading</h2> <p>Retraining Stage. </p><h2>text</h2> <p>As to the retraining stage, we first divide all samples via the trained K-Means cluster. Then we find the majority dimensions for each group from their embedding masks using the deterministic mode. After that, we initialize the deep recommender model 1 and 2 by their corresponding optimal dimensions and train them separately using the samples of each cluster. </p><h2>publication_ref</h2> <p>[] </p><h2>figure_ref</h2> <p>[] </p><h2>table_ref</h2> <p>[] </p><h2>heading</h2> <p>EXPERIMENT </p><h2>text</h2> <p>In this section, we conduct extensive experiments to evaluate our proposed framework. Specifically, the main research questions we care about are as follows:\n• RQ1: How does iHAS perform compared with other mainstream selection methods? • RQ2: Can the proposed iHAS be successfully transferred to more powerful recommender models? • RQ3: How does each component contribute to the overall performance of the proposed iHAS? • RQ4: Does the proposed iHAS demonstrate efficiency when compared to baseline models? • RQ5: Does iHAS construct rational recommender model structures? </p><h2>publication_ref</h2> <p>[] </p><h2>figure_ref</h2> <p>[] </p><h2>table_ref</h2> <p>[] </p><h2>heading</h2> <p>Datasets </p><h2>text</h2> <p>We conduct our experiments mainly on two commonly used public datasets, Avazu 1 and Criteo 2 , which are both large-scale realworld datasets and serve as benchmarks in click-through rate (CTR) prediction tasks. Table 1 presents the detailed statistics of both datasets. Each dataset has been randomly segmented into training/validation/testing sets based on the proportions of 80%, 10%, and 10%.\n• Avazu dataset consists of 40 million users' click records on ads over 11 days. Each record contains 22 categorical field features. Following the general preprocessing steps [29,40],\n1 https://www.kaggle.com/c/avazu-ctr-prediction/ 2 https://www.kaggle.com/c/criteo-display-ad-challenge/ we group fields of which frequency is less than ten as a single field \"others\". • Criteo dataset consists of 46 million users' click records on display ads.
