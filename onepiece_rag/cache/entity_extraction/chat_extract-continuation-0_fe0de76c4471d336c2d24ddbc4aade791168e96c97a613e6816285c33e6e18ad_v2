We slightly abuse the symbol\nA = [ α 1 , • • • , α N ]\nto denote all the continuous architecture parameters and W(A) to represent the downstream DNN parameters. Different from DARTS-style works [7], [17], [19] that use bi-level optimization to iteratively update A and W(A), we follow the setting of [36] and use one-level optimization to simultaneously train A and W(A) on the training set T . In addition to being time-consuming, [36] empirically demonstrated that bi-level optimization might downgrade the final performance due to the accumulation of errors from multiple approximations. On the other hand, we argue that there are many causes that can affect the performance and stability of bi-level optimization, such as the size of the validation set and the switch interval during iterative training. Hence, we adopt one-level optimization for practicality and efficiency by simultaneously updating A and W(A) via gradient descent as follows:\n∂ A L (T ; A, W (A)) and ∂ W(A) L (T ; A, W (A)).

We then seek to derive the optimal subset F ⊆ F and the corresponding dimension configuration C A . Retraining the target DNN model with F and C A aims to eliminate suboptimal influence since the unpicked fields in F and the redundant embedding dimensions are also involved during the pretraining stage. </p><h2>publication_ref</h2> <p>[] </p><h2>figure_ref</h2> <p>[] </p><h2>table_ref</h2> <p>[] </p><h2>heading</h2> <p>Input Configuration Derivation </p><h2>text</h2> <p>Despite the hard selector argmax being widely used in previous DARTS-style work [17], [19], we argue that it can lead to an inconsistency between the pretraining model and the retraining model, resulting in inferior performance. For instance, assume there is a field that has three candidate dimensions with corresponding weights of {0.33, 0.33, 0.34}. It is difficult to judge which operator is better since the gap is too small, and dropping all of the relatively smaller operators can lead to a dilemma that the total weight of the dropped operators is much higher than the selected one. Moreover, due to randomness during DNN model training, the derived optimal operators can also be unstable. To alleviate such issues, we set a cumulative probability threshold (CPT) to flexibly adjust the minimum amount of information kept in the retraining stage, supplemented with a pruning algorithm to derive the embedding dimension d fi for each field f i . The details are presented in Algorithm 1. The intuition behind this is that embedding regions with higher weights contain more effective information and should be retained in preference during pruning.\nRecall that d fi = 0 means that the corresponding field f i is useless and thus can be removed in the retraining stage. By applying Algorithm 1 to each field separately, we simultaneously complete feature selection\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>CPT-BASED PRUNING ALGORITHM<|>CONCEPT<|>The CPT-based Pruning Algorithm is a method used for feature selection and dimension search in deep neural networks, focusing on retaining effective information during the retraining stage.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DNN<|>CONCEPT<|>DNN stands for Deep Neural Network, a type of artificial neural network with multiple layers that can learn from large amounts of data.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ONE-LEVEL OPTIMIZATION<|>CONCEPT<|>One-level optimization is a training approach where architecture parameters and downstream parameters are updated simultaneously, as opposed to bi-level optimization which updates them iteratively.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PRETRAINING STAGE<|>EVENT<|>The pretraining stage is the initial phase in the training of a model where it learns from a dataset before fine-tuning on a specific task.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>RETRAINING STAGE<|>EVENT<|>The retraining stage follows pretraining and aims to refine the model by eliminating suboptimal influences and optimizing the selected features.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CPT-BASED PRUNING ALGORITHM<|>DNN<|>The CPT-based Pruning Algorithm is applied in the context of DNNs to enhance feature selection and improve model performance<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ONE-LEVEL OPTIMIZATION<|>DNN<|>One-level optimization is a technique used in training DNNs to improve efficiency and performance<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PRETRAINING STAGE<|>RETRAINING STAGE<|>The retraining stage follows the pretraining stage in the model training process, refining the model based on insights gained during pretraining<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CPT-BASED PRUNING ALGORITHM<|>RETRAINING STAGE<|>The CPT-based Pruning Algorithm is utilized during the retraining stage to optimize the model by selecting effective features<|>7)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
