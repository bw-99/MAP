Currently, few studies have been done in integrating visualization into the factor investing process. Some existing studies [CHL * 03,RSE09,SLFE11] apply visualizations to help manage investment portfolios. FundExplorer [CHL * 03] introduces a distorted treemap to visualize both the composition of a fund's portfolio and the remaining stocks. Their design facilitates the convenient retrieval of complementary funds to achieve portfolio diversification. FinVis [RSE09] employs visualization to help non-experts understand the expected returns, risks and the changing context of multiple portfolios. PortfolioCompare [SLFE11] displays the variability and correlation of a portfolio's risks and returns by scatterplots and distribution charts. Their designs can assist users in making better investments according to their risk preferences. None of these visualization tools is integrated with predictive and feature selection models for factor investing. </p><h2>publication_ref</h2> <p>[] </p><h2>figure_ref</h2> <p>[] </p><h2>table_ref</h2> <p>[] </p><h2>heading</h2> <p>Interactive Feature Selection </p><h2>text</h2> <p>Feature selection is a key step in machine learning. Prior studies have focused on algorithmic feature selections [LCW * 17], whose mechanism and reasoning are often opaque to users. Inspired by prior research on predictive model visualization [LXL * 18, PKWQ20,ZWLC19,MQB19,EASD * 19], interactive feature selections have been widely studied. These studies allow users to visually explore the feature space by novel representations and interactive interfaces. Seo and Shneiderman [JS04] proposed a rankby-feature framework for the exploration of multidimensional data. Data features are ranked and visualized by scatter plots, bar charts, etc. Johansson and Johansson [JJ09] utilized parallel coordinates to visualize data features, with the order determined by user-defined metrics.\nOn the other hand, there are some works considering the relationship between features and predictive models. For example, SmartStripes [MBD *  11]  Existing studies summarize the feature dependency or performance by hybrid quality measures (e.g., feature ranking), but the temporal evolution of features are rarely considered. In factor investing, the temporal dynamics of financial factors (features) and their influence on the prediction model are crucial, which makes existing work not suitable for our scenario. </p><h2>publication_ref</h2> <p>[] </p><h2>figure_ref</h2> <p>[] </p><h2>table_ref</h2> <p>[] </p><h2>heading</h2> <p>System Overview </p><h2>text</h2> <p>In this section, the technical background of interactive factor investing is introduced, on which key user requirements are summarized.\nTo meet these requirements, four user tasks are defined which are achieved by a pipeline design in our system. </p><h2>publication_ref</h2> <p>[] </p><h2>figure_ref</h2> <p>[] </p><h2>table_ref</h2> <p>[] </p><h2>heading</h2> <p>Background </p><h2>text</h2> <p>Historically, factor investing originated from the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM) proposed by Sharpe [Sha64] and Linter [Lin65], which uses a single factor of a stock's sensitivity to market returns to explain stock returns. Then, researchers and practitioners continued to discover new factors related to stock returns. Notably, Fama and French [FF92] proposed the famous three-factor model which considers a size factor (large v.s. small capitalization stocks) and a value factor (high v.s. low book-to-market ratios) in addition to the market sensitivity factor. Later, many factors explaining stock returns were discovered, including a company's recent fundamental data [Asn97], the long-term income growth of companies [PLdSSV98, DS97], etc.\nIn a typical quantitative investment scenario for stock markets, traders hold a portfolio composed of a collection of individual stocks appropriately mixed in value. The portfolio is adjusted in regular time intervals, which is also known as the trading cycle. Depending on the style of traders and funds, the trading cycle can range from one day/week (e\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}}
