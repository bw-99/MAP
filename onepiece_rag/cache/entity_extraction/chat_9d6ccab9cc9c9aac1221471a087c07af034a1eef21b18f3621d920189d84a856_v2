Suppose that x = k-1 i=1 U i is given. For given α, β, and x, we know that Eq. ( 17) becomes 1 -\n(α + β)x + 0.5αβ(x 2 + k-1 i=1 U 2 i ). That is, only the last term 0.5αβ( k-1 i=1 U 2 i ) depends on how U i values are actually assigned. Moreover, k-1 i=1 U 2 i is a well-known convex function with respect to U 1 , U 2 , . . . , U k-1 . That is, ρU 2 i + (1 -ρ)U 2 j ≥ (ρU i + (1 -ρ)U j ) 2 for any 0 ≤ ρ ≤ 1.\nTherefore,\nk-1 i=1 U 2 i is minimized when U 1 = U 2 = • • • = U k-1 = x k-1 .\nHence, what we have to do is to find the infimum x such that the condition in Eq. ( 17) does not hold. That is,\ninfimum x s. t. C k t k > 1 -(α + β)x + 0.5αβ x 2 + x 2 k -1 .\nThis means that as long as\nk-1\ni=1 U i is no more than such infimum x, the condition in Eq. ( 17) always holds and the schedulability can be guaranteed. Provided that C k t k is given, we can simply solve the above problem by finding the x with\n0 = 1 -C k t k -(α + β)x + 0.5αβ k k-1 x 2 .\nThere are two roots in the above quadratic equation. The smaller root, i.e., the righthand side of Eq. ( 18), is the infimum by definition.\nLemma 5. For a given k-point last-release schedulability test of a scheduling algorithm, with the properties in Definition 4, provided that α + β ≥ 1, then task τ k is schedulable by the scheduling algorithm if\nC k t k + k-1 i=1 Ui ≤          k-1 k   α + β -(α + β) 2 -2αβ k k-1 αβ   , if k > (α+β) 2 -1 α 2 +β 2 -1 and α 2 + β 2 > 1 1 + (k-1)((α+β-1)-1 2 (α+β) 2 +0.5) kαβ otherwise(19)\nProof: The proof is similar to the proof of Lemma 4, but slightly more involved. We detail the proof in Appendix A.\nBy the fact that\n(α + β) 2 -2αβ k k-1 = (α + β) 2 -2αβ -2αβ 1 k-1\n, which is an increasing function with respect to k, and the fact that k-1 k is a decreasing function with respect to k, we know that the right-hand side of Eq. ( 19) (when α 2 + β 2 > 1) decreases with respect to k. Similarly, the right-hand side of Eq. ( 18) also decreases with respect to k. Therefore, for evaluating the utilization bounds, it is alway safe to take k → ∞ as a safe upper bound. The right-hand side of Eq. ( 18) converges to\nα+β-α 2 +β 2 +2αβ C k t k αβ when k → ∞. The right-hand side of Eq. (19) (when α 2 + β 2 > 1) converges to α+β- √ α 2 +β 2 αβ when k → ∞. </p><h2>publication_ref</h2> <p>[] </p><h2>figure_ref</h2> <p>[] </p><h2>table_ref</h2> <p>[] </p><h2>heading</h2> <p>Response Time Analysis Framework </p><h2>text</h2> <p>We now further discuss the utilization-based response-time analysis framework. Lemma 6. For a given k-point response time analysis, defined in Definition 3, of a scheduling algorithm, in which 0\n< α i ≤ α, 0 < β i ≤ β for any i = 1, 2, . . . , k -1, 0 < t k and k-1 i=1 α i U i < 1, the response time to execute C k for task τ k is at most C k + k-1 i=1 β i C i - k-1 i=1 α i U i ( k-1 =i β C ) 1 - k-1 i=1 α i U i . (20\n)\nProof: The proof is similar to the proof of Lemma 1. The detailed proof is in Appendix A. Not all the last release time orderings are safe for the worstcase response time analysis. Fortunately, similar to Lemma 2, we can safely consider only one specific last release time ordering of the k -1 higher-priority tasks as shown in the following\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}}
