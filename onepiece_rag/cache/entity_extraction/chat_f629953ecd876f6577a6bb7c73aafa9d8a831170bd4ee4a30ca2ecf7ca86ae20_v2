In this paper, patch generation is implemented with fix patterns presented in the literature since it may make the generated patches more robust [74]. Patch Validation. The ultimate goal of APR systems is to automatically generate a correct patch that can actually resolve the program defects rather than satisfying minimal functional constraints. At the beginning, patch correctness is evaluated by passing all test cases [26,36,83]. However, these patches could be overfitting [34,69] and even worse than the bug [76]. Since then, APR systems are evaluated with the precision of generating correct patches [19,49,84,92]. Recently, researchers explore automated frameworks that can identify patch correctness for APR systems automatically [35,91]. In this paper, our approach validates generated patches with regression test suites since fail-inducing test cases are readily available for most of bugs as described in Section 2. </p><h2>publication_ref</h2> <p>['b47', 'b66', 'b79', 'b87', 'b3', 'b84', 'b57', 'b41', 'b2', 'b19', 'b47', 'b40', 'b36', 'b53', 'b37', 'b82', 'b52', 'b91', 'b92', 'b13', 'b17', 'b18', 'b25', 'b31', 'b35', 'b48', 'b50', 'b51', 'b72', 'b11', 'b81', 'b64', 'b7', 'b15', 'b54', 'b69', 'b76', 'b85', 'b24', 'b61', 'b73', 'b25', 'b35', 'b82', 'b33', 'b68', 'b75', 'b18', 'b48', 'b83', 'b91', 'b34', 'b90'] </p><h2>figure_ref</h2> <p>[] </p><h2>table_ref</h2> <p>[] </p><h2>heading</h2> <p>CONCLUSION </p><h2>text</h2> <p>In this study, we have investigated the feasibility of automating patch generation from bug reports. To that end, we implemented iFixR, an APR pipeline variant adapted to the constraints of test cases unavailability when users report bugs. The proposed system revisits the fundamental steps, notably fault localization, patch generation and patch validation, which are all tightly-dependent to the positive test cases [83] in a test-based APR system.\nWithout making any assumptions on the availability of test cases, we demonstrate, after re-organizing the Defects4J benchmark, that iFixR can generate and recommend priority correct (and more plausible) patches for a diverse set of user-reported bugs. The repair performance of iFixR is even found to be comparable to that of the majority of test-based APR systems on the Defects4J dataset.\nWe open source iFixR's code and release all data of this study to facilitate replication and encourage further research in this direction which is promising for practical adoption in the software development community: https://github.com/SerVal-DTF/iFixR  </p><h2>publication_ref</h2> <p>['b82'] </p><h2>figure_ref</h2> <p>[] </p><h2>table_ref</h2> <p>[] </p>\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}}
