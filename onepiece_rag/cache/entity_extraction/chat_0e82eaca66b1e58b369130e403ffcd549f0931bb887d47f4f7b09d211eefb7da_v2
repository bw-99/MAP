Similarly, noise is generated using the second set of parameters (mean2, cov2). To create a correlation between these two sets of samples, the function uses a correlation factor. This factor determines how much of the final synthetic data (correlated samples) will be influenced by the base samples versus the noise. This introduces a controlled amount of dependence between the two sets of samples, simulating correlated data. By controlling the correlation factor, the code can simulate different degrees of correlation between the two sets of data. This synthetic data is then used in the code to evaluate the performance of the Hit-and-Run sampler in estimating the cross-covariance of correlated distributions. It evaluates the accuracy of the estimation by comparing it to a ground truth and measures performance using Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) and Frobenius norm.\n# Calculate the variance of the projection variance_projection = np.dot( direction_normalized.T, np.dot(cov, direction_normalized) ) # Calculate the standard deviation of the projection std_deviation = np.sqrt(variance_projection) # Find the z-scores for the specified confidence interval z_score = norm.ppf((1 + confidence) / 2)   <h2>publication_ref</h2>[]<h2>figure_ref</h2>[]<h2>table_ref</h2>[]<h2>heading</h2><h2>text</h2>Source code and documentation are available at: https://github.com/Novartis/scOTGM.<h2>publication_ref</h2>[]<h2>figure_ref</h2>[]<h2>table_ref</h2>[]<h2>heading</h2><h2>text</h2>import numpy as np from scipy.stats import multivariate_normal, norm import matplotlib.pyplot as plt def generate_random_params(dimension: int) -> tuple:\n\"\"\" Generate random means and covariances for a given dimension.\nArgs: dimension (int): The dimensionality of the mean and covariance.\nReturns: tuple: A tuple containing the mean vector and covariance matrix.   <h2>publication_ref</h2>[]<h2>figure_ref</h2>[]<h2>table_ref</h2>[]<h1>references</h1><h2>ref_id</h2>b0<h2>title</h2>A multiplexed single-cell crispr screening platform enables systematic dissection of the unfolded protein response<h2>journal</h2>Cell<h2>year</h2>2016<h2>authors</h2>Britt Adamson; Marco Thomas M Norman; Min Y Jost; James K Cho; Yuwen Nuñez; Jacqueline E Chen; Luke A Villalta; Max A Gilbert; Marco Y Horlbeck;  Hein<h2>ref_id</h2>b1<h2>title</h2>Learning the optimal tikhonov regularizer for inverse problems<h2>journal</h2>Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems<h2>year</h2>2021<h2>authors</h2>Ernesto De Giovanni S Alberti; Matti Vito; Luca Lassas; Matteo Ratti;  Santacesaria<h2>ref_id</h2>b2<h2>title</h2>Relative loss bounds for on-line density estimation with the exponential family of distributions<h2>journal</h2>Machine learning<h2>year</h2>2001<h2>authors</h2>S Katy; Manfred K Azoury;  Warmuth<h2>ref_id</h2>b3<h2>title</h2>Modelling cellular perturbations with the sparse additive mechanism shift variational autoencoder<h2>journal</h2><h2>year</h2>2023<h2>authors</h2>Michael Bereket; Theofanis Karaletsos<h2>ref_id</h2>b4<h2>title</h2>A deep dive into single-cell rna sequencing foundation models<h2>journal</h2>bioRxiv<h2>year</h2>2023<h2>authors</h2>Rebecca Boiarsky; M Nalini; Alejandro Singh; Gad Buendia; David Getz;  Sontag<h2>ref_id</h2>b5<h2>title</h2>Learning single-cell perturbation responses using neural optimal transport<h2>journal</h2>Nature Methods<h2>year</h2>2023<h2>authors</h2>Charlotte Bunne; Stefan G Stark; Gabriele Gut; Jacobo Sarabia; Del Castillo; Mitch Levesque; Kjong-Van Lehmann; Lucas Pelkmans; Andreas Krause; Gunnar Rätsch<h2>ref_id</h2>b6<h2>title</h2>scgpt: towards building a foundation model for single-cell multi-omics using generative ai<h2>journal</h2>bioRxiv<h2>year</h2>2023<h2>authors</h2>Haotian Cui; Chloe Wang; Hassaan Maan; Kuan Pang; Fengning Luo; Bo Wang<h2>ref_id</h2>b7<h2>title</h2>Sinkhorn distances: Lightspeed computation of optimal transport<h2>journal</h2>Advances in neural information processing systems<h2>year</h2>2013<h2>authors</h2>Marco Cuturi<h2>ref_id</h2>b8<h2>title</h2>\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}}
