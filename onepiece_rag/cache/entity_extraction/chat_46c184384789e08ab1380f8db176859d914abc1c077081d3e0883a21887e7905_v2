It is also easy to check that this union need only be taken over all subsets T of {v 1 , . . . , v n } with 2 ≤ |T | ≤ ⌊ n-ℓ 2 ⌋. We now use a standard union bound argument to obtain\nP (κ = ℓ) ∩ (δ > ℓ) ∩ E(J ) ≤ U∈N n,ℓ ,T ∈N U c : 2≤|T |≤⌊ n-ℓ 2 ⌋ P A U,T ∩ E(J ) = ⌊ n-ℓ 2 ⌋ r=2 U∈N n,ℓ ,T ∈N U c ,r P A U,T ∩ E(J )(147)\nwith N U c ,r denoting the collection of all subsets of U c with exactly r elements.\nFor each r = 1, . . . , nℓ -1, we simplify the notation by writing A ℓ,r := A {v1,...,v ℓ },{v ℓ+1 ,...,v ℓ+r } , D ℓ,r := D {v1,...,v ℓ },{v ℓ+1 ,...,v ℓ+r } , B ℓ,r := B {v1,...,v ℓ },{v ℓ+1 ,...,v ℓ+r } and C r := C {v ℓ+1 ,...,v ℓ+r } . Under the enforced assumptions on the system model (viz. Section III), exchangeability yields\nP [A U,T ] = P [A ℓ,r ] , U ∈ N n,ℓ , T ∈ N U c ,r\nand the expression\nU∈N n,ℓ ,T ∈N U c ,r P A U,T ∩ E(J ) = n ℓ n -ℓ r P A ℓ,r ∩ E(J ) follows since |N n,ℓ | = n ℓ and |N U c ,r | = n-ℓ r .\nSubstituting into (147) we obtain the key bound\nP (κ = ℓ) ∩ (δ > ℓ) ∩ E(J ) ≤ ⌊ n-ℓ 2 ⌋ r=2 n ℓ n -ℓ r P A ℓ,r ∩ E(J ) . (148\n)\nThe proof of Proposition 4 will be completed once we show\nlim n→∞ ⌊ n-ℓ 2 ⌋ r=2 n ℓ n -ℓ r P A ℓ,r ∩ E(J ) = 0.(149)\nThe means to do so are provided in the next section.\nXII. BOUNDING PROBABILITIES P A ℓ,r ∩ E(J )\nFirst, for r = 2, 3, . . . , nℓ -1, observe the equivalence\nD ℓ,r = n j=r+ℓ+1 ∪ i∈νr,j S i ∩ S j = ∅(150)\nwhere ν r,j is defined via\nν r,j := {i = ℓ + 1, ℓ + 2, . . . , ℓ + r : C ij }(151)\nfor each j = 1, 2, . . . , ℓ and j = r + ℓ + 1, r + ℓ + 2, . . . , n. In words, ν r,j is the set of indices in i = ℓ + 1, ℓ + 2, . . . , ℓ + r for which v i is connected to the node v j in the communication graph G(n; p n ). Thus, the event ∪ i∈νr,j S i ∩ S j = ∅ ensures that node v j is not connected (in G on ) to any of the nodes {v ℓ+1 , . . . , v ℓ+r }. Under the enforced assumptions on the rvs S 1 , S 2 , . . . , S n , we readily obtain the expression\nP   D ℓ,r S i , i = ℓ + 1, . . . , ℓ + r C ij , i = ℓ + 1, . . . , ℓ + r, j = ℓ + r + 1, . . . , n   = n j=r+ℓ+1   Pn-|∪i∈ν r,j Si| Kn Pn Kn   .\nIn a similar manner, we find\nP   B ℓ,r S i , i = ℓ + 1, . . . , ℓ + r C ij , i = 1, . . . , ℓ, j = ℓ + 1, . . . , ℓ + r   = ℓ j=1   1 - Pn-|∪i∈ν r,j Si| Kn Pn Kn   .\nIt is clear that the distributional properties of the term | ∪ i∈νr,j S i | will play an important role in efficiently bounding P [D ℓ,r ] and P [B ℓ,r ]. Note that it is always the case that\n| ∪ i∈νr,j S i | ≥ K n 1 [|ν r,j | > 0] .(152\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}}
