Vicente Dominguez; Denis Parra<h1>pub_date</h1><h1>abstract</h1>is paper introduces pyRecLab, a so ware library wri en in C++ with Python bindings which allows to quickly train, test and develop recommender systems. Although there are several so ware libraries for this purpose, only a few let developers to get quickly started with the most traditional methods, permi ing them to try di erent parameters and approach several tasks without a significant loss of performance. Among the few libraries that have all these features, they are available in languages such as Java, Scala or C#, what is a disadvantage for less experienced programmers more used to the popular Python programming language. In this article we introduce details of pyRecLab, showing as well performance analysis in terms of error metrics (MAE and RMSE) and train/test time. We benchmark it against the popular Java-based library LibRec, showing similar results. We expect programmers with li le experience and people interested in quickly prototyping recommender systems to be bene ted from pyRecLab.<h1>sections</h1><h2>heading</h2>INTRODUCTION<h2>text</h2>When so ware developers face the challenge of learning about recommender systems (RecSys), developing a RecSys for the rst time, or quickly prototyping a recommender to test available data, a reasonable option to get started is using an existent so ware library. Nowadays, it is possible to nd several libraries in di erent programming languages, being among of the most popular ones MyMedialite [3], LensKit [2], LibRec [4], lightfm [6] and rrecsys [1].\nWhile the aforementioned tools have documentation, implement several methods, and present most of the common functionality required to develop and evaluate a recommendation system, all Permission to make digital or hard copies of part or all of this work for personal or classroom use is granted without fee provided that copies are not made or distributed for pro t or commercial advantage and that copies bear this notice and the full citation on the rst page.
