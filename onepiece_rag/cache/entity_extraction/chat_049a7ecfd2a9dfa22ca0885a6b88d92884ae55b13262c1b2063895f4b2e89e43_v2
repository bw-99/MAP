Conceptually, those queries are boolean functions. Complex queries are often conjunctions of the form r = q 1 ∧ q 2 ∧ • • • ∧ q n .\nIn our formalism, these simple queries translate into simple pre-order relations of the form xRy. Requiring an element to be in an interval can be represented by xR q y iff x is in the desired interval, or x is not situated further from the interval than yfoot_11 . Requiring an attribute to be equal to a given value translates into the relation xR q y if for x the attribute takes the required valuefoot_12 . Complex queries then translate into the composite relations of the form R r = R q1 ∧ R q2 ∧ • • • ∧ R qn . The simple sub-relations R q2 are pre-order relations, and, therefore, R r is also a pre-order relation and is transitive. However, these relations are not partial order relations, as reflexivity does not necessarily hold. A \"topological\" sorting according to our partial order relation R r can be viewed as a valid fuzzy relaxation of the strict functional query. There are many possible fuzzy relaxations and the problem is to find one that is suitable for a given application. The k-Pareto optimality is one of such fuzzy extensions of the query. It is 0 if all criteria are satisfied, and higher values of k-Pareto optimality indicate worse results. The maximum choice theorem applies here, and the user is offered the maximum choice. This is of particular interest for exploratory queries, such as job search, especially, if there are no items in the database that satisfy all the criteria. Direct brute-force search for selections offering maximum choice is unfeasible as there are too many selections to consider.\nMoreover, in the above formalism, one can treat classical optimization objectives in the same way. Maximizing an attribute x can be represented by the relation xRy iff x ≥ y, and the minimization can be represented by the relation ≤. In the above framework, negation can be represented via the relation R -1 defined by xR -1 y iff yRx. </p><h2>publication_ref</h2> <p>[] </p><h2>figure_ref</h2> <p>[] </p><h2>table_ref</h2> <p>[] </p><h2>heading</h2> <p>C.6 Scheduling Algorithms </p><h2>text</h2> <p>In the case of scheduling algorithms, xRy can be given the meaning 'x depends on y'. Then, selections represent sets of tasks that remain to be processed. Having a large choice means having much freedom to parallelize tasks or having flexibility in case the rescheduling is required. </p><h2>publication_ref</h2> <p>[] </p><h2>figure_ref</h2> <p>[] </p><h2>table_ref</h2> <p>[] </p><h2>heading</h2> <p>Supplementary Materials A Further Examples for Simple Relations and Measures </p><h2>text</h2> <p>In the first two supplementary examples, we consider a situation typical in economics or multi-objective optimization.
