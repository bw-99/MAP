To investigate this hypothesis, we leveraged the attention scores calculated for each dimension to observe if such a phenomenon exists as shown in Figure 3, in which we identified the top frequently attended words for each dimension. It conclusively demonstrated that indeed, each dimension possessed words that were distinctly associated with it, as evident through their diagonal co-cluster effect. Furthermore, these words encompassed diverse types and themes. For instance, within the word cluster positioned in the middle (bound with a green rectangle and arrows pointed), the words are \"light, day, night, bulb, room,\" it can be easily inferred that these particular dimensions pertain to items related to indoor electric lights, encompassing discussions about the brightness and color characteristics of the products. We also explored the direct relationships between different dimensions of the review representations and item representations since we hypothesized that the text within a review would have a certain connection with the item's title or picture. To apply the concept to the embedding representation within the latent space, each dimension of the review embedding should have a specific relationship with the corresponding dimension in the item embedding. By employing the formula developed in Section 3.3, we obtained matrix 𝐷 successfully. Subsequently, through spectral clustering analysis, we were able to confirm the presence of a specific correlation between the review and the embedding dimensions of the item. Referring to Figure 4, we can initially observe the successful differentiation between review embedding dimensions and item embedding dimensions. This differentiation enables us to trace back the importance of the current review embedding dimension and its corresponding dimensions in item embeddings. By doing so, we gain insights into the frequent transmission of specific information between these two latent spaces and understand the type of information that is transparent in-between.\nTo conclude, for RAUM, we can treat the matrix 𝐷 not only as a projection for the review from its space to the item space, but also as an attention matrix to further select the significance of users' reviews toward different interacted items. The design of RAUM not only effectively assists the user preference modeling, but also increases the interpretability of attention.<h2>publication_ref</h2>[]<h2>figure_ref</h2>[]<h2>table_ref</h2>[]<h2>heading</h2>CONCLUSION<h2>text</h2>In this work, we proposed a new method to effectively model the common scenario in the recommendation. In the scenario, users click the item based on the image and text information provided and write down review comments. The printf jointly models the item's image and textual features and determines user preference based on review comments via a bipartite user-item interaction graph. The crucial keys in our model include not only the utilization of a cross-modality feature alignment encoder in CMIM to extract global semantics from item information but also the effectiveness of dimension-based attention in RAUM to make up a deficiency of the semantic gap, making the information have a better starting position of propagation in EPIM stage. Extensive experiments on three real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness, power, and significant improvement of our printf.<h2>publication_ref</h2>[]<h2>figure_ref</h2>[]<h2>table_ref</h2>[]<h1>references</h1><h2>ref_id</h2>b0<h2>title</h2>Unifying Knowledge Graph Learning and Recommendation: Towards a Better Understanding of User Preferences<h2>journal</h2><h2>year</h2>2019<h2>authors</h2>Yixin Cao; Xiang Wang; Xiangnan He; Zikun Hu; Tat-Seng Chua<h2>ref_id</h2>b1<h2>title</h2>Neural Attentional Rating Regression with Review-Level Explanations<h2>journal</h2>WWW<h2>year</h2>2018<h2>authors</h2>Chong Chen; Min Zhang; Yiqun Liu; Shaoping Ma<h2>ref_id</h2>b2<h2>title</h2>Convolutional neural network for sentence classification<h2>journal</h2><h2>year</h2>2015<h2>authors</h2>Yahui Chen<h2>ref_id</h2>b3<h2>title</h2>UNITER: UNiversal Image-TExt Representation Learning<h2>journal</h2><h2>year</h2>2020<h2>authors</h2>Yen-Chun Chen; Linjie Li; Licheng Yu; Ahmed El Kholy; Faisal Ahmed; Zhe Gan; Yu Cheng; Jingjing Liu<h2>ref_id</h2>b4<h2>title</h2>ANR: Aspect-based neural recommender<h2>journal</h2><h2>year</h2>2018<h2>authors</h2>Jin Yao Chin; Kaiqi Zhao; Shafiq Joty; Gao Cong<h2>ref_id</h2>b5<h2>title</h2>TPR: Text-Aware Preference Ranking for Recommender Systems<h2>journal</h2><h2>year</h2>2020<h2>authors</h2>Yu-Neng Chuang; Chih-Ming Chen; Chuan-Ju Wang; Ming-Feng Tsai; Yuan Fang; Ee-Peng Lim<h2>ref_id</h2>b6<h2>title</h2>BERT: Pre-training of Deep Bidirectional Transformers for Language Understanding<h2>journal</h2><h2>year</h2>2019<h2>authors</h2>Jacob Devlin; Ming-Wei Chang\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}}
