A PROOF OF PROPOSITION 4 </p><h2>text</h2> <p>We start by introducing some notation. For any non-empty subset U of nodes, i.e., U ⊆ {v 1 , . . . , v n }, we define the graph G on (U ) (with vertex set U ) as the subgraph of G on restricted to the nodes in U . If all nodes in U are deleted from G on , the remaining graph is given by G on (U c ) on the vertices U c = {v 1 , . . . , v n } \\ U . Let N U c denote the collection of all nonempty subsets of {v 1 , . . . , v n } \\ U . We say that a subset T in N U c is isolated in G on (U c ) if there are no edges (in G on ) between the nodes in T and the nodes in U c \\ T . This is characterized by\nE ij , v i ∈ T, v j ∈ U c \\ T.\nWith each non-empty subset T ⊆ U c of nodes, we associate several events of interest: Let C T denote the event that the subgraph G on (T ) is itself connected. The event C T is completely determined by the random variables (rvs) {S i , v i ∈ T } and {C ij , v i , v j ∈ T }. We also introduce the event D U,T to capture the fact that T is isolated in G on (U c ), i.e., D U,T :=\nvi∈T vj ∈U c \\T E ij .\nFinally, we let B U,T denote the event that each node in U has an edge with at least one node in T , i.e., B U,T :=\nvi∈U vj ∈T E ij .\nWe also set\nA U,T := B U,T ∩ C T ∩ D U,T .\nThe proof starts with the following observations: In graph G on , if the connectivity is ℓ (i.e., κ = ℓ) and yet each node has degree at least ℓ + 1 (i.e., δ > ℓ), then there must exist subsets U , T of nodes with\nU ∈ N , |U | = ℓ and T ∈ N U c , |T | ≥ 2, such that G on (T ) is connected while T is isolated in G on (U c\n). This ensures that G on can be disconnected by deleting an appropriately selected set of ℓ nodes; i..e, nodes in U . Notice that, this would not be possible for sets T in N U c with |T | = 1, since the degree of a node in T is at least ℓ+1 by virtue of the event δ > ℓ; this ensures that a single node in T is connected to at least one node in U c \\ T . Moreover, the event κ = ℓ also enforces G on to remain connected after the deletion of any ℓ -1 nodes. Therefore, if there exists a subset U (with |U | = ℓ) such that some T in N U c is isolated in G on (U c ), then each of the ℓ nodes in U should be connected to at least one node in T and to at least one node in U c \\ T . This can easily be seen by contradiction: Consider subsets U ∈ N with |U | = ℓ, and T ∈ N U c with |T | ≥ 2, such that there exists no edge between the nodes in T and the nodes in U c \\ T . Suppose there exists a node v i in U such that v i is connected to at least one node in U c \\ T but is not connected to any node in T . Then, G on can be disconnected by deleting the nodes in U \\ {v i } since there will be no edge between the nodes in T and the nodes in {v i } ∪ U c \\ T . But, |U \\ {v i }| = ℓ -1, and this contradicts the fact that κ = ℓ.\nThe inclusion\n[(κ = ℓ) ∩ (δ > ℓ)] ⊆ U∈N n,ℓ , T ∈N U c : |T |≥2 A U,T\nis now immediate with N n,r denoting the collection of all subsets of {v 1 , . . . , v n } with exactly r elements. It is also easy to check that this union need only be taken over all subsets T of {v 1 , . . . , v n } with 2 ≤ |T | ≤ ⌊ n-ℓ 2 ⌋. We now use a standard union bound argument to obtain\nP (κ = ℓ) ∩ (δ > ℓ) ∩ E(J ) ≤ U∈N n,ℓ\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}}
