Three importance metrics can be displayed by the checkboxes in the top row of the factor view: weight, value, and contribution (default). All the circles on the same time unit are vertically aligned by a fixed order of their corresponding factors to facilitate factor tracking and comparison along the timeline. As each factor can have a positive or negative contribution in different time units, we depict positive and negative factors as circles above and below the x-axis respectively.\nUser interactions are designed in the factor view to help identify useful factors for modeling. When a user hovers a factor circle, all the circles representing the same factor are linked by a curved line to reveal its stability over time. (Figure 2(b)). Also, a tooltip will be displayed, showing the detailed information of the factor circle such as factor type, name, sensitivity and importance metric. The user can interactively filter factors to reduce visual complexity.\nAlternative designs of the factor view have been considered. The line chart is the most intuitive form to visualize factor importance over time. When we have as many as 56 factors, line charts suffer from severe visual clutter. Stacked flow chart [BW08] is another possible visual design. A quick overview of factor composition can be provided, but it is not good at displaying the temporal dynamics of individual factors (especially for unimportant factors). For the circle layout, we also experimented with circle packing in which positive and negative factors are placed separately. The circle packing leads to more compact visualization (Figure 3(a)). However, our domain experts complained that the design made it difficult to track individual factors across the timeline. The relative position of the same factor circle varied a lot across different time units. In an improved layered circle packing (Figure 3(b)), which is similar to a matrix design, the same type of factors is aligned horizontally. It facilitates tracking of the same factor, but the space usage is inefficient and the connecting lines on factors lead to heavy crossings. The current design is a good trade-off between space usage and effectiveness compared with other alternative designs.<h2>publication_ref</h2>[]<h2>figure_ref</h2>['fig_2', 'fig_2', 'fig_2', 'fig_4', 'fig_4']<h2>table_ref</h2>[]<h2>heading</h2>Stock View<h2>text</h2>Stock view (Figure 2(c)) splits the aggregated factor time series in the factor view according to their importance to individual stocks. This helps to evaluate the factor performance among different stocks and sectors (T2). The visual design is challenging, as the space for each stock is limited and there could be many factors relevant to a stock. On each factor, there are also multiple attributes to be visualized, e.g., the magnitude and polarity of importance (contribution), the model bias, and the trend of the stock price.\nIn our design, the visualization of each stock follows a similar layout to the display in the factor view. As shown in Figure 2(c), the x-axis is a timeline divided into units. At each time unit, a stock bar is drawn (the yellow bar of Figure 6 (d)), whose height represents the ratio of stock price change in this time unit and width represents the rate of prediction error on the price change by models. A red (green) bar indicates a rise (drop) of the stock price. On top of and below each stock bar, there are two factor glyphs which summarize the factors having a positive and negative contribution to the price change in the predictive model.\nThe factor glyph at the top and bottom in Figure 6 (d) has a circular shape, and is composed of one inner circle and six angular sectors in the outside. The radius of the inner circle encodes the model bias. Each outer sector represents one type of factors, with the size of each sector indicating the sum of all factor's importance in this type. On each factor glyph, the top-5 factors with the highest importance in all factor types are displayed. When more than one factor from the same type belongs to the top-5, a Voronoi diagram is drawn to pack these factors in the same angular sector. Each region in the Voronoi diagram corresponds to one factor, with the region size indicating its importance. The sum of all the other factor's importance out of the top-5 category is represented by the grey region close to the glyph center. When users hover a Voronoi region of one factor, a line will be drawn to connect all the Voronoi regions of this factor over time. Meanwhile, a tooltip showing the factor type, name and importance will also appear. When the factor does not belong to the top-5 category, the line will be linked to zero position on the x-axis.\nAlternative designs such as line chart and streamgraph [HHN00] are commonly used for visualizing temporal evolution of variables. In our scenario, the top-5 factors can be quite different in separate time units, making line charts or streamgraph discontinuous over time and hard to track by users. Commodity designs such as stacked bar charts and pie charts are also considered. Nevertheless, the stacked bar chart is not scalable to support dozens of factors in the same view. The pie chart can clearly show the percentage of each factor in importance, but again the relative position of the same factor can vary a lot in different units, making it hard to compare the evolution of the same factor. iQUANT is designed for financial factor selection, which makes it inevitable to consider much domain knowledge and incorporate different factors in our design. This can increase the design complexity and it takes some time for user to learn, but most of our users can be well prepared after a training session\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}}
