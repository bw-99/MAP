The dataset consists of: 34,546 papers and 421,578 citations.<h2>publication_ref</h2>['b8']<h2>figure_ref</h2>[]<h2>table_ref</h2>[]<h2>heading</h2>DBLP Citation Graph:<h2>text</h2>This paper citation network is collected from DBLP [24] and consists of 5,354,309 papers and 48,227,950 citation relationships.\nTwitter Follow Graph: We curate Twitter user-follows-user (available via API) by first selecting a number of 'highly-followed' users that we refer to as 'content producers'; these content producers serve as 'items' in our recommender systems terminology. We then sampled users that follow these content producer accounts. All users are anonymized with no other personally identifiable information (e.g., demographic features) present. Additionally, the timestamp of each follow edge was mapped to an integer that respects date ordering, but does not provide any information about the date that follow occurred. In total, we have 261M edges and 15.5M vertices, with a max-degree of 900K and a min-degree of 5. We hope that this dataset will be of useful to the community as a test-bed for large-scale retrieval research.<h2>publication_ref</h2>['b23']<h2>figure_ref</h2>[]<h2>table_ref</h2>[]<h2>heading</h2>Metrics:<h2>text</h2>We evaluate kNN-Embed on three aspects: (1) the recall (2) diversity and (3) goodness of fit of retrieved candidates. Below, we formalize these metrics.<h2>publication_ref</h2>[]<h2>figure_ref</h2>[]<h2>table_ref</h2>[]<h2>heading</h2>Recall@K:<h2>text</h2>The most natural (and perhaps most important) metric for computing the efficacy of various candidate retrieval strategies is Recall@K. This metric is given by considering a fixed number of top candidates yield by a retrieval system (up to size K) and measuring what percent of these candidates are heldout relevant candidates. The purpose of most candidate retrieval systems is to collect a high-recall pool of items for further ranking, and thus recall is a relevant metric to consider. Additionally, recall provides an indirect way to measure diversity -to achieve high recall, one is obliged to return a large fraction of all relevant documents, which simple greedy ANN searches can struggle with.<h2>publication_ref</h2>[]<h2>figure_ref</h2>[]<h2>table_ref</h2>[]<h2>heading</h2>Diversity:<h2>text</h2>To evaluate the diversity among the retrieved candidates, we measure the spread in the embeddings of the retrieved candidates by calculating the average distance retrieved candidates are from their centroid. The underlying idea is that when 'locality implies similarity'; as a corollary, if candidates are further in Euclidean distance, then they are likely to be different. As such, for a given set of candidates C, we compute diversity D as follows:\nD(C) = 1 |C| i k ∈C ∥i k -î∥(8)\nwhere C denotes the set of retrieved candidates and î = i k ∈C i k /|C| is the mean of the unimodal embeddings of the retrieved candidates.<h2>publication_ref</h2>[]<h2>figure_ref</h2>[]<h2>table_ref</h2>[]<h2>heading</h2>Goodness of Fit:<h2>text</h2>In addition to diversity of retrieved items, we need to ensure that a user's mixture representation is an accurate model of their intereststhat is the mixture of embeddings identifies points in the embedding space where relevant items lie. Thus, we compare held out relevant items to the user's mixture representation we use to query. We measure this \"goodness of fit\" by computing the Earth Mover's Distance (EMD) [19] between a uniform distribution over a user's relevant items and the user's mixture distribution. The EMD measures the distance between two probability distributions over a metric space [17,7]. We measure the distance between a user's cluster distribution (e.g., Equation 3 and Equation 4), to a uniform distribution over a held-out set of relevant items: p(i|u j ) over a Euclidean space. We compute EMD by soft assigning all held-out relevant items of a user to clusters, minimizing the sum of item-cluster distances, with the constraint that the sum over soft assignments matches p(c|u j ). As seen in Figure 2, with standard unimodal representations, a single embedding vector is compared to the held-out items and the goodness of fit is the distance between the item embeddings and the singular user embedding. In comparison, for mixture representations (Figure 2, each user multiple user embeddings who each have fractional probability mass that in total sums to 1. The goodness of fit is then the distance achieved by allocating the mass in each item to the closest user embedding cluster with available probability mass. Observing unimodal representations in Fig. 2, a single unimodal embedding is situated in the embedding space and compared to held-out relevant items.\nAs shown, some held-out items are close to the unimodal embedding, while others are further away. In contrast, for mixture representations, each user has multiple user-embeddings and each of these embeddings lies\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}}
