Here, we start from the pseudo-polynomial-time schedulability test by Guan et al. [29] that we only have to consider M -1 tasks with carryin jobs, for constrained-deadline (hence, also for implicitdeadline) task sets. More precisely, we can define two different time-demand functions, depending on whether task τ i is with a carry-in job or not: 5\nW carry i (t) = C i 0 < t < C i C i + t-Ci Ti C i otherwise,(31)\nand\nW normal i (t) = t T i C i .(32)\nMoreover, we can further over-approximate W carry i (t), since W carry i (t) ≤ W normal i (t)+C i . Therefore, a sufficient schedulability test for testing task τ k with k > M for global RM is to verify whether\n∃0 < t ≤ T k , C k + ( τi∈T C i ) + ( k-1 i=1 W normal i (t)) M ≤ t. (33\n)\n5 This is an over-approximation of the linear function used by Guan et al. [29].\nfor all T ⊆ hp(τ k ) with |T | = M -1.\nThis leads to the following theorem by using Lemma 1.\nTheorem 5. Task τ k in a sporadic implicit-deadline task system is schedulable by global RM on M processors if\nk-1 i=1 C i ≤ M T k and U k ≤ 1- τ i ∈T Ci M T k - k-1 i=1 Ui M - k-1 i=1 Ci M T k + k-1 i=1 (Ui k-1 =i C ) M 2 T k . (34\n)\nby indexing the k -1 higher-priority tasks in a non-decreasing order of ( T k Ti -1)T i for every τ i ∈ hp(τ k ) and by putting the M -1 higher-priority tasks with the largest execution times into T . Proof: It is not necessary to enumerate all T ⊆ T with |T | = M -1 if we can construct the task set T ⊆ hp(τ k ) with the maximum τi∈T C i . To use k 2 Q, we are certain about which tasks should be put into the carry-in task set T by assuming that C i and T i are both given. That is, we simply have to put the M -1 higher-priority tasks with the largest execution times into T . This can be imagined as if we increase the execution time of task\nτ k from C k to C k = C k + τ i ∈T Ci M . Moreover, we have α i = 1 M and β i = 1 M for every task τ i ∈ hp(τ k ) in this case.\nTherefore, based on the test in Eq. ( 33), we have the last release time ordering defined by indexing the k -1 higherpriority tasks in a non-decreasing order of ( T k Ti -1)T i for every τ i ∈ hp(τ k ). By adopting Lemma 1 with α i = 1 M and\nβ i = 1 M , we know that task τ k is schedulable by global RM if k-1 i=1 Ci M ≤ T k and C k + τ i ∈T C i M T k ≤ 1- k-1 i=1 Ui M - k-1 i=1 Ci M T k + k-1 i=1 (Ui k-1 =i C ) M 2 T k .(35)\nBy reorganizing the above inequality, we reach the conclusion.\nWe can always take the pessimistic last release time ordering in Lemma 2, for concluding the following theorem. Theorem 6. Task τ k in a sporadic implicit-deadline task system is schedulable by global RM on M processors if the condition in Eq. (34) holds by indexing the k-1 higher-priority tasks in a non-increasing order of T i , for every τ i ∈ hp(τ k ).\nProof: This is proved based on the same argument in Theorem 5 by adopting Lemmas 1 and 2.\nWe can of course revise the statement in Theorems 5 and 6 by adopting Lemma 3 and Lemma 4 to construct schedulability tests by using only the utilization of the higher-priority tasks.<h2>publication_ref</h2>['b28', 'b28']<h2>figure_ref</h2>[]<h2>table_ref</h2>[]<h2>heading</h2>Evaluation Results<h2>text</h2>We conduct experiments using synthesized task sets for evaluating the tests in Theorem 5 and Theorem 6. We first generated a set of sporadic tasks. The cardinality of the task set was 5 times the number of processors, i.e., 40 tasks on 8 multiprocessor systems. The UUniFast-Discard method [23] was adopted to generate a set of utilization values with the given goal. We used the approach suggested by Davis et al. [25] to generate the task periods according to a uniform distribution in the range of the logarithm of the task periods (i.e., log-uniform distribution).
