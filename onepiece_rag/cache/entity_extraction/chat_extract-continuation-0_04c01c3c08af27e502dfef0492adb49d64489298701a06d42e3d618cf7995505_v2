The developers then need to check out the buggy version, modify the buggy code to fix the bug, and generate the patch that can be applied to the shared source code repository. The result of this challenging and time-consuming process by developers for bug 11975 is the patch in Figure 1(b). The patch deletes the line that writes 5 bytes to buffer state (denoted by -strcpy(state, \"off \");), and adds a new line to write only 4 bytes to state (+ strcpy(state, \"off\");), which fixes the overflow bug.\nDevelopers often need to fix more bugs than their time and resources allow [6]. Although developers spend almost half of their time fixing bugs [21], bugs take years to be fixed on average [9], [19].\nTherefore, support to make it easier and faster for developers to fix bugs is in high demand. The capability to automatically generate patches (e.g., Figure 1(b)) from bug reports (e.g., Figure 1(a)) could: (1) save programmers' time and effort in diagnosing bugs and generating patches, allowing developers to fix more bugs or focus on other development tasks; and (2) shorten the bug-fixing time, thus improve software reliability and security. </p><h2>publication_ref</h2> <p>['b5', 'b20', 'b8', 'b18', 'b0'] </p><h2>figure_ref</h2> <p>['fig_1', 'fig_1', 'fig_1', 'fig_1'] </p><h2>table_ref</h2> <p>[] </p><h2>heading</h2> <p>A. Ideal Goal Versus Realistic Goal </p><h2>text</h2> <p>Ideally, we want to automatically generate patches for all bug reports. Realistically, it is impossible. We found that only 16.7-33.5% of bug reports in the Linux kernel, Mozilla, and Apache bug databases are fixed. This is because, many bug reports are invalid, unreproducible, incomplete, etc. Even among bugs that can be fixed, some are too complex to be fixed automatically because they require redesign of the algorithm, addition of new features, etc.  (1) which explicitly include localization information, (2) where the symptom (e.g., buffer overrun) is explicitly indicated by the reporter, and ( 3) which are about one of the following three simple bug types: Buffer overflow, Null Pointer dereference or memory leak. R2Fix runs a straightforward classification to identify the bug category and uses a match and transform engine (e.g., Coccinelle [66]) to generate patches. As the authors admitted, their target space represents <1% of bug reports in their dataset. Furthermore, it should be noted that, given the limited scope of the changes implemented in its fix patterns, R2Fix does not need to run tests for verifying that the generated patches do not break any functionality.\nThis paper. We propose to investigate the feasibility of a program repair system driven by bug reports, thus we replace classical spectrum-based fault localization with Information Retrieval (IR)-based fault localization. Eventually, we propose iFixR, a new program repair workflow which considers a practical repair setup by imitating the fundamental steps of manual debugging. iFixR works under the following constraint:\nWhen a bug report is submitted to the issue tracking system, a relevant test case reproducing the bug may not be readily available.\nTherefore, iFixR is leveraged in this study to assess to what extent an APR pipeline is feasible under the practical constraint of limited test suites. iFixR uses bug reports written in natural language as the main input. Eventually, we make the following contributions:\n‚Ä¢ We present the architecture of a program repair system adapted to the constraints of maintainers dealing with user-reported bugs.\nIn particular, iFixR replaces classical spectrum-based fault localization with Information Retrieval (IR)-based fault localization. ‚Ä¢ We propose a strategy to prioritize patches for recommendation to developers. Indeed, given that we assume only the presence of regression test cases to validate patch candidates, many of these patches may fail on the future test cases that are relevant to the reported bugs. We order patches to present correct patches first. ‚Ä¢ We assess and discuss the performance of iFixR on the Defects4J benchmark to compare with the state-of-the-art APR tools. To that end, we provide a refined Defects4J benchmark for APR targeting bug reports. Bugs are carefully linked with the corresponding bug reports, and for each bug we are able to dissociate future test cases that were introduced after the relevant fixes. Overall, experimental results show that there are promising research directions to further investigate towards the integration of automatic patch generation\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>BUG REPORT<|>concept<|>A bug report is a document submitted by users or developers that describes an issue or defect in the software, often including details about how to reproduce the bug and its impact on functionality.)\n(\"entity\"<|>PATCH<|>concept<|>A patch is a piece of code designed to fix a bug in software, which modifies the existing codebase to resolve issues and improve functionality.)\n(\"entity\"<|>BUFFER OVERFLOW<|>concept<|>Buffer overflow is a type of bug that occurs when a program writes more data to a buffer than it can hold, potentially leading to crashes or security vulnerabilities.)\n(\"entity\"<|>NULL POINTER DEREFERENCE<|>concept<|>Null pointer dereference is a bug that occurs when a program attempts to access memory through a pointer that is null, leading to crashes or undefined behavior.)\n(\"entity\"<|>MEMORY LEAK<|>concept<|>Memory leak is a type of bug where a program fails to release memory that is no longer needed, which can lead to increased memory usage and eventual system failure.)\n(\"entity\"<|>iFIXR<|>concept<|>iFixR is a proposed program repair workflow that utilizes bug reports to drive the repair process, replacing traditional fault localization methods with Information Retrieval-based techniques.)\n(\"entity\"<|>R2FIX<|>concept<|>R2Fix is a program repair system that automatically generates patches for specific types of bugs based on bug reports, using classification and transformation techniques.)\n(\"entity\"<|>DEFECTS4J<|>concept<|>Defects4J is a benchmark dataset used for evaluating automatic program repair tools, containing a collection of real-world bugs and their corresponding test cases.)\n(\"entity\"<|>AUTOMATIC PROGRAM REPAIR (APR)<|>concept<|>Automatic Program Repair (APR) refers to techniques and systems designed to automatically fix bugs in software without human intervention.)\n(\"relationship\"<|>BUG REPORT<|>PATCH<|>A bug report serves as the input for generating a patch, detailing the issue that the patch aims to fix<|>9)\n(\"relationship\"<|>BUFFER OVERFLOW<|>PATCH<|>Patches are specifically created to address buffer overflow bugs, modifying the code to prevent such vulnerabilities<|>8)\n(\"relationship\"<|>NULL POINTER DEREFERENCE<|>PATCH<|>Patches are developed to fix null pointer dereference bugs, ensuring that the program does not attempt to access null references<|>8)\n(\"relationship\"<|>MEMORY LEAK<|>PATCH<|>Patches are designed to resolve memory leak issues by ensuring proper memory management in the code<|>8)\n(\"relationship\"<|>iFIXR<|>BUG REPORT<|>iFixR uses bug reports as the main input to drive the program repair process<|>9)\n(\"relationship\"<|>R2FIX<|>BUG REPORT<|>R2Fix generates patches based on bug reports, focusing on specific types of bugs<|>7)\n(\"relationship\"<|>iFIXR<|>R2FIX<|>iFixR proposes a new workflow that builds upon the concepts introduced by R2Fix for automatic program repair<|>6)\n(\"relationship\"<|>DEFECTS4J<|>iFIXR<|>iFixR is assessed on the Defects4J benchmark to evaluate its performance against other APR tools<|>7)\n(\"relationship\"<|>AUTOMATIC PROGRAM REPAIR (APR)<|>iFIXR<|>iFixR is a system developed within the field of Automatic Program Repair, aiming to improve the bug-fixing process<|>8) \n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
