Namely, we will show that if the sequence Œ± ‚Ä≤ : N 0 ‚Üí R is defined such that\np e = ln n + (k -1) ln ln n + Œ± ‚Ä≤ n n(25)\nfor any n ‚àà N 0 , then it holds that\nŒ± ‚Ä≤ n = Œ± n ¬± O(1)(26)\nunder the enforced assumptions. In view of lim n‚Üí‚àû (ln n + (k -1) ln ln n+ Œ± n ) = ‚àû and (26), we get lim n‚Üí‚àû p e n = ‚àû from (25). Thus, for any «´ > 0, we have p e n > «´ for all n sufficiently large. Hence, all the conditions enforced by Theorem 1 are met, and under ( 25) and ( 26), Corollary 1 follows from Theorem 1 since\nlim n‚Üí‚àû Œ± ‚Ä≤ n = ¬±‚àû if lim n‚Üí‚àû Œ± n = ¬±‚àû.\nWe now establish (26). First, as seen by the analysis given in Section V-B below, we can introduce the extra condition Œ± n = o(ln n) in proving part (b) of Corollary 1; i.e., in proving the one-law under the condition lim n‚Üí‚àû Œ± n = ‚àû. This yields (15). Also, in the case lim n‚Üí‚àû Œ± n = -‚àû, we have Œ± n < 0 for all n sufficiently large so that\np n K 2 n Pn = O( ln n n ) under\np n K 2 n Pn = O( ln n n )\n. Now, in order to establish (26), we observe from part (a) of Lemma 8foot_1 that\np s = K 2 n P n ¬± O K 4 n P 2 n .(27)\nThen, from (27) and the fact that p e = p s p n , we get\np e = p n ‚Ä¢ K 2 n P n ¬± p n ‚Ä¢ K 2 n P n ‚Ä¢ O K 2 n P n .(28)\nSubstituting (15),\np n K 2 n Pn = O( ln n n ) and K 2 n Pn = O 1 ln n into (28), we find p e = ln n + (k -1) ln ln n + Œ± n ¬± O(1) n .
