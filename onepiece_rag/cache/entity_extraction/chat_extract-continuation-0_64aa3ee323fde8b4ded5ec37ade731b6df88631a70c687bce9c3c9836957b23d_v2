Specifically, he proves that if\nK n ≥ 2, P n = Ω(n) and p n • 1 - ( Pn -Kn Kn ) ( Pn Kn )\n∼ c ln n n hold, and lim n→∞ (p n ln n) exists, then graph G(n, K n , P n ) ∩ G(n, p n ) is asymptotically almost surely connected (resp., not connected) if c > 1 (resp., c < 1). A comparison of our results with the related work is given in Section IV-D.\nAfter the submission of this paper, we have derived the asymptotically exact probability of k-connectivity in G(n, K n , P n ) [45] (resp., G on [44]). Based on the proofs in this paper, we show i) that [45] under P n = Ω(n), if the sequence α n defined through\nK 2 n Pn = ln n+(k-1) ln ln n+αn n has a limit α * ∈ [-∞, ∞], then the probability of G(n, K n , P n ) being k-connected converges to e -e -α *\n(k-1)! as n → ∞, and ii) that [44] under P n = Ω(n) and Kn Pn = o(1), if the sequence\nα n defined through p n • 1 - ( Pn -Kn Kn ) ( Pn Kn ) = ln n+(k-1) ln ln n+αn n has a limit α * ∈ [-∞, ∞],\nthen the probability of G on being k-connected converges to e -e -α * (k-1)! as n → ∞.<h2>publication_ref</h2>['b10', 'b15', 'b10', 'b11', 'b29', 'b1', 'b31', 'b38', 'b1', 'b38', 'b31', 'b4', 'b36', 'b44', 'b43', 'b44', 'b43']<h2>figure_ref</h2>[]<h2>table_ref</h2>[]<h2>heading</h2>III. SYSTEM MODEL G on<h2>text</h2>Consider a vertex set V = {v 1 , v 2 , . . . , v n }. Each node v i ∈ V is assigned a key ring S i that consists of K n distinct keys selected uniformly at random from a key pool P of size P n . The random key graph G(n, K n , P n ) is defined on the vertex set V such that two distinct nodes v i and v j are adjacent, denoted K ij , if their key rings have at least one key in common; i.e.,\nK ij = [S i ∩ S j = ∅].\nFor distinct nodes v x and v y , we let S xy denote the intersection of their key rings S x and S y ; i.e., S xy = S x ∩ S y .\nOur main interest is to study random key graphs whose links are unreliable. In particular, we assume that each link is on with probability p n , or off with probability 1p n , independently from any other link. Namely, with C ij denoting the event that link between v i and v j is on, {C ij , 1 ≤ i < j ≤ n} are mutually independent such that\nP [C ij ] = p n , 1 ≤ i < j ≤ n.(1)\nThis unreliable link model can be represented [11] by an Erdős-Rényi (ER) graph G(n, p n ) on the vertices V such that there exists an edge between nodes v i and v j if the link between them is on; i.e., if the event C ij takes place.\nFinally, the graph G on (n, K n , P n , p n ) is defined on the vertices V such that two distinct nodes v i and v j have an edge in between, denoted E ij , if the events K ij and C ij take place at the same time. In other words, we have\nE ij = K ij ∩ C ij , 1 ≤ i < j ≤ n(2)\nso that\nG on (n, K n , P n , p n ) = G(n, K n , P n ) ∩ G(n, p n ).(3)\nThroughout, we simplify the notation by writing G on instead of G on (n, K n , P n , p n ). Thus, our main model G on is an intersection of a random key graph and an ER graph. Throughout, we let p s (K n , P n ) be the probability that the key rings of two distinct nodes share at least one key and let p e (K n , P n , p n ) be the probability that there exists a link between two distinct nodes in G on . For simplicity, we write p s (\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>YAGAN<|>PERSON<|>Yagan is a researcher who provided a zero-one law for connectivity in random key graphs.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>G(n, K n, P n)<|>EVENT<|>G(n, K n, P n) is a random key graph model that studies connectivity properties based on key sharing among nodes.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>G(n, p n)<|>EVENT<|>G(n, p n) is an Erdős-Rényi graph model that represents unreliable links between nodes.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>G on<|>EVENT<|>G on is a model defined as the intersection of a random key graph and an Erdős-Rényi graph.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>V<|>ORGANIZATION<|>V is a vertex set consisting of nodes in the random key graph model.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>YAGAN<|>G(n, K n, P n)<|>Yagan's research provides foundational insights into the properties of the random key graph G(n, K n, P n)<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>G(n, K n, P n)<|>G(n, p n)<|>G(n, K n, P n) and G(n, p n) are both models used to study connectivity in graphs<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>G(n, K n, P n)<|>G on<|>G on is defined as the intersection of G(n, K n, P n) and G(n, p n)<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>G(n, p n)<|>G on<|>G on is defined as the intersection of G(n, K n, P n) and G(n, p n)<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>V<|>G(n, K n, P n)<|>V is the vertex set on which the random key graph G(n, K n, P n) is defined<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>V<|>G(n, p n)<|>V is the vertex set on which the Erdős-Rényi graph G(n, p n) is defined<|>6)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
