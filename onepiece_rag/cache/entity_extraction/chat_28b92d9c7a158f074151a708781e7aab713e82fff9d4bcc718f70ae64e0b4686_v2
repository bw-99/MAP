Observing unimodal representations in Fig. 2, a single unimodal embedding is situated in the embedding space and compared to held-out relevant items.\nAs shown, some held-out items are close to the unimodal embedding, while others are further away. In contrast, for mixture representations, each user has multiple user-embeddings and each of these embeddings lies close to a cluster of relevant items. The intuition is that if a user has multiple item clusters they are interested in, multiple user embeddings can better capture these interests.  <h2>publication_ref</h2>['b18', 'b16', 'b6']<h2>figure_ref</h2>['fig_0', 'fig_0', 'fig_0']<h2>table_ref</h2>[]<h2>heading</h2>Experiments<h2>text</h2>Experimental Setup: For our underlying ANN-based candidate retrieval system, we start by creating a bipartite graph between source entities and target entities for each dataset, with each edge representing explicit relevance between items (e.g., citing paper cites cited paper or user follows content producer). We then learn unimodal 100-dimensional embeddings for users and items by training over 20 epochs and cluster them via spherical k-means over 20 epochs [2].\nEvaluation Task: We evaluate three candidate retrieval strategies -baseline ANN with unimodal embeddings (which is how most ANN-based candidate retrieval systems work), mixture of embeddings with no smoothing [23], and mixture of embeddings with smoothing (i.e., kNN-Embed). For each strategy, we compute the Recall@K, diversity, and fit in a link prediction task.<h2>publication_ref</h2>['b1', 'b22']<h2>figure_ref</h2>[]<h2>table_ref</h2>[]<h2>heading</h2>Research Hypotheses:<h2>text</h2>We explore two research hypotheses (as well as achieve some understanding of the hyperparameters): (1) Unimodal embeddings miss many relevant items due to the similarity of retrieved items. Mixtures yield more diverse and higher recall candidates. ( 2) Smoothing, by using information from neighboring users, further improves the recall of retrieved items. Approach R@10 R@20 R@50 R@10 R@20 R@50 R@10 R@20 R@50 Unimodal 20.0% 30.0% 45.7% 9.4% 13.9% 21.6% 0.58% Recall of unimodal vs mixture vs kNN-Embed-higher is better. HEP-TH (λ = 0.8, 2000 clusters, 5 embeddings). DBLP (λ = 0.8, 10000 clusters, 5 embeddings). Twitter-Follow (λ = 0.8, 40000 clusters, 5 embeddings).<h2>publication_ref</h2>[]<h2>figure_ref</h2>[]<h2>table_ref</h2>[]<h2>heading</h2>Recall:<h2>text</h2>In Table 1, we report results when evaluating recall on citation prediction tasks. Results support the first hypothesis that unimodal embeddings may miss relevant items if they don't lie close to the user in the shared embedding space. Mixture of embeddings with no smoothing, yields a 14% relative improvement in R@10 for for HEP-TH, and 16% relative improvement for DBLP. Our second hypothesis (2) posits that data sparsity can lead to sub-optimal mixtures of embeddings, and that nearest-neighbor smoothing can mitigate this. Our experiments support this hypothesis, as we see a 25% relative improvement for HEP-TH in R@10, and 35% for DBLP and when using kNN-Embed. We see similar significant improvements over baselines in R@20 and R@50. For Twitter-Follow, the improvements in recall are dramatic -534% in relative terms going from unimodal embeddings to a mixture of embeddings in R@10. We suspect this significant improvement is because Twitter-Follow simultaneously has a much higher average degree than HEP-TH and DBLP and the number of unique nodes is much larger. It is a more difficult task to embed so many items, from many different interest clusters, in close proximity to a user. As such, we see a massive improvement by explicitly querying from each user's interest clusters. Applying smoothing provides an additional 74% in relative terms, and similar behaviours are observed in R@20 and R@50.<h2>publication_ref</h2>['b1']<h2>figure_ref</h2>[]<h2>table_ref</h2>['tab_2']<h2>heading</h2>Diversity:<h2>text</h2>We apply Equation 8 to retrieved candidates and measure the spread of retrieved candidates' embedding vectors. As seen in Table 2, the candidates from unimodal retrieval are less diverse than candidates retrieved via multiple queries from mixture representations. This verifies our first research hypothesis that unimodal embeddings may retrieve many items that are clustered closely together as a by-product of ANN retrieval (i.e., diversity and recall is low). However, multiple queries from mixtures of embeddings broadens the search spatially; retrieved items are from different clusters, which are more spread out from each other. kNN-Embed (i.e., smooth mixture retrieval) results in slightly less diverse candidates than unsmoothed mixture retrieval.
