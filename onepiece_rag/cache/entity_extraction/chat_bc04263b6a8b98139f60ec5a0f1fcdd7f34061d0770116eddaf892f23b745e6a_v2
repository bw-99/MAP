Notably, various studies [10,34,69,76,94] have raised concerns about overfitting patches: a typical APR tool that uses a test suite as the correctness criterion can produce a patched program that actually overfits the test-suite (i.e., the patch makes the program pass all test cases but does not actually repair it). Recently, new research directions [89,97] are being explored in the automation of test case generation for APR to overcome the overfitting issue. Nevertheless, so far they have had minimal positive impact due to the oracle problem [98] in automatic test generation. At the same time, the software industry takes a more systematic approach for patch validation by developers. For instance, in the open-source community, the Linux development project has integrated a patch generation engine to automate collateral evolutions that are validated by maintainers [29,66]. In proprietary settings, Facebook has recently reported on their Getafix [75] tool, which automatically suggests fixes to their developers. Similarly, Ubisoft developed Clever [64] to detect risky commits at commit-time using patterns of programming mistakes from the code history.\nPatch recommendation for validation by developers is acceptable in the software development communities. It may thus be worthwhile to focus on tractable techniques for recommending patches in the road to fully automated program repair. </p><h2>publication_ref</h2> <p>['b25', 'b62', 'b75', 'b90', 'b9', 'b33', 'b68', 'b75', 'b93', 'b88', 'b96', 'b97', 'b28', 'b65', 'b74', 'b63'] </p><h2>figure_ref</h2> <p>[] </p><h2>table_ref</h2> <p>[] </p><h2>heading</h2> <p>THE IFIXR APPROACH </p><h2>text</h2> <p>Figure 2 overviews the workflow of the proposed iFixR approach. Given a defective program, we consider the following issues:\n(1) Where is the bug? We take as input the bug report in natural language submitted by the program user. We rely on the information in this report to localize the bug positions. (2) How should we change the code? We apply fix patterns that are recurrently found in real-world bug fixes. Fix patterns are selected following the structure of the abstract syntax tree representing the code entity of the identified suspicious code. (3) Which patches are valid? We make no assumptions on the availability of positive test cases [83] that encode functionality requirements at the time the bug is discovered. Nevertheless, we leverage existing test cases to ensure, at least, that the patch does not regress the program. (4) Which patches do we recommend first? In the absence of a complete test suite, we cannot guarantee that all patches that pass regression tests will fix the bug. We rely on heuristics to re-prioritize the validated patches in order to increase the probability of placing a correct patch on top of the list. </p><h2>publication_ref</h2> <p>['b82'] </p><h2>figure_ref</h2> <p>['fig_2'] </p><h2>table_ref</h2> <p>[] </p><h2>heading</h2> <p>Input: Bug reports </p><h2>text</h2> <p>Issue tracking systems (e.g., Jira) are widely used by software development communities in the open source and commercial realms.

Table 3 illustrates a typical bug report when a user of the LANG library code has encountered an issue while using the NumberUtils API. A description of erroneous behavior is provided.
