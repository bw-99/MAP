The confusion matrix shows how many of the items recommended in the top-N lists (column predicted positive; d + b) were withheld items and thus correct recommendations (cell d) and how many where potentially incorrect (cell b). The matrix also shows how many of the not recommended items (column predicted negative; a + c) should have actually been recommended since they represent withheld items (cell c).\nFrom the confusion matrix several performance measures can be derived. For the data mining task of a recommender system the performance of an algorithm depends on its ability to learn significant patterns in the data set. Performance measures used to evaluate these algorithms have their root in machine learning. A commonly used measure is accuracy, the fraction of correct recommendations to total possible recommendations.<h2>publication_ref</h2>['b22']<h2>figure_ref</h2>[]<h2>table_ref</h2>[]<h2>heading</h2>Accuracy = correct recommendations total possible recommendations<h2>text</h2>= a + d a + b + c + d (10)\nA common error measure is the mean absolute error (MAE, also called mean absolute deviation or MAD).\nMAE = 1 N N i=1 | i | = b + c a + b + c + d , (11\n)\nwhere N = a + b + c + d is the total number of items which can be recommended and | i | is the absolute error of each item. Since we deal with 0-1 data, | i | can only be zero (in cells a and d in the confusion matrix) or one (in cells b and c). For evaluation recommender algorithms for rating data, the root mean square error is often used. For 0-1 data it reduces to the square root of MAE.\nRecommender systems help to find items of interest from the set of all available items. This can be seen as a retrieval task known from information retrieval. Therefore, standard information retrieval performance measures are frequently used to evaluate recommender performance. Precision and recall are the best known measures used in information retrieval (Salton and McGill 1983;van Rijsbergen 1979).\nPrecision = correctly recommended items total recommended items = d b + d (12) Recall = correctly recommended items total useful recommendations = d c + d (13)\nOften the number of total useful recommendations needed for recall is unknown since the whole collection would have to be inspected. However, instead of the actual total useful recommendations often the total number of known useful recommendations is used. Precision and recall are conflicting properties, high precision means low recall and vice versa. To find an optimal trade-off between precision and recall a single-valued measure like the E-measure (van Rijsbergen 1979) can be used. The parameter α controls the trade-off between precision and recall.\nE-measure = 1 α(1/Precision) + (1 -α)(1/Recall)(14)\nA popular single-valued measure is the F-measure. It is defined as the harmonic mean of precision and recall.\nF-measure = 2 Precision Recall Precision + Recall = 2 1/Precision + 1/Recall (15)\nIt is a special case of the E-measure with α = .5 which places the same weight on both, precision and recall. In the recommender evaluation literature the F-measure is often referred to as the measure F1.\nAnother method used in the literature to compare two classifiers at different parameter settings is the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC). The method was developed for signal detection and goes back to the Swets model (van Rijsbergen 1979). The ROC-curve is a plot of the system's probability of detection (also called sensitivity or true positive rate TPR which is equivalent to recall as defined in formula 13) by the probability of false alarm (also called false positive rate FPR or 1 -specificity, where specificity = a a+b ) with regard to model parameters. A possible way to compare the efficiency of two systems is by comparing the size of the area under the ROC-curve, where a bigger area indicates better performance.<h2>publication_ref</h2>['b35', 'b40']<h2>figure_ref</h2>[]<h2>table_ref</h2>[]<h2>heading</h2>Recommenderlab Infrastructure<h2>text</h2>recommenderlab is implemented using formal classes in the S4 class system. Figure 3 shows the main classes and their relationships.\nThe package uses the abstract ratingMatrix to provide a common interface for rating data. ratingMatrix implements many methods typically available for matrix-like objects. For example, dim(), dimnames(), colCounts(), rowCounts(), colMeans(), rowMeans(), colSums() and rowSums(). Additionally sample() can be used to sample from users (rows) and image() produces an image plot.\nFor ratingMatrix we provide two concrete implementations realRatingMatrix and binaryRatingMatrix to represent different types of rating matrices R. realRatingMatrix implements a rating matrix with\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}}
