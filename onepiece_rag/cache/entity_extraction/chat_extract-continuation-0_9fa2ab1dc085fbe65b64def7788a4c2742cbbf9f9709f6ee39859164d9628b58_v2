We need a safe function for estimating their workload. More precisely, we want to find two constants U i,k,h and C i,k,h such that U i,k,h • t i,q ≥ rbf (i, q, t i,q ) and U i,k,h • t i,q + C i,k,h ≥ rbf (i, q, t i,q + ) = rbf (i, q, D k,h ). This means that no matter which frame of task τ i is the first frame in the critical instant, we can always bound the workload from task τ i by using U i,k,h • t + C i,k,h for the points that we are interested to test. According to the above discussions, we can set U i,k,h = max q=0,1,...,mi-1 max rbf (i, q, t i,q ) t i,q\nC i,k,h = max q=0,1,...,mi-1 rbf (i, q, D k,h ) -U i,k,h • t i,q (60)\nNow, we can reorganize the schedulability test to link to Definition 2.\nLemma 13. The h-th frame of task τ k in a generalized multiframe task system with constrained deadlines is schedulable by a fixed-priority scheduling on a uniprocessor system if the following condition holds: For any last release ordering π of 9 The reason why this is not an exact test was recently provided by Stigge and Wang in [45].\nthe k -1 higher-priority tasks with t 1,q1 ≤ t 2,q2 ≤ • • • ≤ t k-1,q k-1 ≤ t k = D k,h , there exists t j,qj such that\nC k,h + k-1 i=1 U i,k,h • t i,qi + j-1 i=1 C i,k,h ≤ t j,qj ,(61)\nwhere U i,k,h and C i,k,h are defined in Eqs. (59) and (60), respectively.\nProof: This comes from the above discussions and Lemma 12.\nThe choice of q i only affects the last release ordering of the k -1 higher-priority tasks, but it does not change the constants U i,k,h and C i,k,h . Therefore, Lemma 13 satisfies Definition 2 by removing the indexes q, but the worst-case last release time ordering has to be considered.\nTheorem 11. Suppose that k-1 i=1 C i,k,h < D k,h . The h-th frame of task τ k in a generalized multiframe task system with constrained deadlines is schedulable by a scheduling algorithm on a uniprocessor system if the following condition holds\nC k,h D k,h ≤ 1- k-1 i=1 U i,k,h - k-1 i=1 (C i,k,h -U i,k,h ( k-1 =i C ,k,h )) D k,h ,(62\n) in which the k -1 higher-priority tasks are indexed in a nonincreasing order of C i,k,h U i,k,h of task τ i .\nProof: The schedulability test (under a specified last release time ordering π) in Lemma 13 satisfies Definition 2 with α i = β i = 1. Therefore, we can apply Lemmas 1 and 2 to reach the conclusion of the proof.\nA naïve implementation to calculate t i,q and rbf (i, q, t) requires O(m i ) time complexity. Therefore, calculating U i,k,h and C i,k,h requires O(m 2 i ) time complexity with such an implementation. It can be calculated with better data structures and implementations to achieve O(m i ) time complexity. That is, we first calculate t i,0 and rbf (i, 0, t i,0 ) in O(m i ) time complexity. The overall time complexity to calculate the following t i,q and rbf (i, q, t i,q ) can be done in O(m i ) by using simple algebra. Therefore, the time complexity of the schedulability test in Theorem 11 is O( k-1 i=1 m i + k log k). Remarks: Although we focus ourselves on generalized multiframe task systems in this section, it can be easily seen that our approach can also be adopted to find polynomial-time tests based on the request bound function presented in [28]. Since such functions have been shown useful for schedulability tests in more generalized task models, including the digraph task model [44], the recurring real-time task model [6], etc., the above approach can also be applied for such models by quantifying the utilization (e.g., U i,k,h ) and the execution time (e.g., C i,k,h ) of task τ i based on the limited options of the last release times before the deadline (e.g., D k,h in generalized multi-frame) to be tested.\nframework to obtain the polynomial-time schedulability test in the following theorems.\nTheorem 12.

Suppose that there are k -1 tasks with higher-priority modes than task mode τ k,h . Let ∆ max k be max{max τ k,j ∈hp(τ k,h ) { C k,j T k,j }, C k,h D k,h }. Suppose that k-1 i=1 C max i < D k,h .
