Random key graphs have received much interest recently, owing in part to their wide applicability in various domains including recommender systems, social networks, secure sensor networks, clustering and classification analysis, and cryptanalysis to name a few.

We present conditions on how to scale this model's parameters so that i) the minimum node degree in the graph is at least k, and ii) the graph is k-connected, both with high probability as the number of nodes becomes large. The results are given in the form of zeroone laws with critical thresholds identified and shown to coincide for both graph properties. These findings improve the previous results by Rybarczyk on the k-connectivity of random key graphs (with reliable links), as well as the zero-one laws by Yagan on the 1-connectivity of random key graphs with unreliable links. </p><h1>sections</h1><h2>heading</h2> <p>I. INTRODUCTION </p><h2>text</h2> <p>Random key graphs have received significant interest recently with applications spanning key predistribution in secure wireless sensor networks (WSNs) [2], [5], [8], [9], [13], social networks [7], [18], [41], recommender systems [27], clustering and classification analysis [4], [19], cryptanalysis of hash functions [3], circuit design [35], and the modeling of epidemics [1] and \"small-world\" networks [38]. They belong to a larger class of random graphs known as random intersection graphs [2]- [7], [10], [14], [28], [34], [35]; in fact, they are referred to as uniform random intersection graphs by some authors [2], [3], [6], [28], [32]- [34], [45], [46].\nTo fix the terminology, we will describe random key graphs in the context of secure WSNs, where they have originated from. Security is expected to be a key challenge in resource constrained sensor networks. A widely accepted solution for securing WSN communications is the random predistribution of cryptographic keys to sensor nodes, and utilization of symmetric-key encryption modes [17], [21], [31] to ensure message secrecy and authenticity. Among various key predistribution algorithms proposed to date, the original scheme by Eschenauer and Gligor (EG) [13] is still the most widely recognized one. According to the EG scheme, each of the n sensors is assigned K n distinct keys that are selected uniformly at random from a key pool of size P n . Two sensors can then securely communicate over an existing communication link if they have at least one key in common; i.e., if they share a common key. This notion of adjacency defines the random key graph, hereafter denoted by G(n, K n , P n ). For generality, K n and P n are assumed to scale with the number of nodes n, with the natural condition 1 ‚â§ K n ‚â§ P n always imposed.\nIn this paper, we study connectivity properties of random key graphs in the presence of unreliable links. Unreliability of the edges are captured by independent Bernoulli random variables, rendering each edge of G(n; K n , P n ) to be on (with probability p n ) or off (with probability 1p n ) independently from all other edges. Put differently, we consider an Erd≈ës-R√©nyi (ER) graph G(n; p n ) [11] on the same set of n vertices, with edges appearing between any pair of vertices independently with probability p n . A random key graph with unreliable links thus corresponds to the intersection of a random key graph and an ER graph. Hereafter, we denote this graph by G on = G(n; K n , p n ) ‚à© G(n; p n ); see Section III for precise definitions.\nJust like the random key graph, the G on model can be used in various applications, particularly when links are expected to be unreliable. For example, in a secure WSN application, links might be unreliable due to wireless media of the communication, or due to physical obstacles and altering environmental conditions severally impairing the transmission. We refer the reader to [39] and [41] for two other applications of G on : i) secure connectivity of WSNs under an on-off channel model, and ii) large scale, distributed publish-subscribe services in online social networks, respectively.\nThe main goal of this paper to study k-connectivity of G on . A network (or graph) is said to be k-connected if for each pair of nodes there exist at least k mutually disjoint paths connecting them. An equivalent definition of k-connectivity is that a network is k-connected if the network remains connected despite the failure of any (k -1) nodes [29]; a network is said to be simply connected if it is 1-connected. kconnectivity is a fundamental graph property and is important for various applications of random key graphs. For example, in a WSN application where sensor nodes operate autonomously and physically\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}}
