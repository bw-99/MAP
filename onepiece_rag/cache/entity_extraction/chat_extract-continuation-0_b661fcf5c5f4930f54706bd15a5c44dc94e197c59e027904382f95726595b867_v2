Therefore, the final embedding of the input data 𝑿 𝑖 through 𝑁 embedding tables is\n𝑬 𝑖 = [𝒆 𝑖,1 , • • • , 𝒆 𝑖,𝑛 , • • • , 𝒆 𝑖,𝑁 ].\nNotably, the embedding dimension search techniques we discussed earlier in Section 2.2 (also the focus of this paper) aim at searching the optimal dimensions for embedding tables\n𝑽 = [𝒗 1 , • • • , 𝒗 𝑛 , • • • , 𝒗 𝑁 ].\nSpecifically, our goal is to discover the optimal individual embedding dimension for each field, given the inherent diversity in the heterogeneous dataset.

Empirically, it comprises multiple fully-connected (FC) layers (characterized by parameter 𝜽 ) and is also equipped with non-linear activation functions such as ReLU [1] or Sigmoid, thereby facilitating the nonlinear encoding process of these representations.\nIn the iHAS system, we will train three different DLRMs, as illustrated in Figure 1. Each DLRM consists of an embedding layer and an MLP component. These three models are named the base recommender model, recommender model 1, and recommender model 2, which are characterized by the parameter groups {𝑽, 𝜽 } 𝑏 , {𝑽, 𝜽 } 1 , and {𝑽, 𝜽 } 2 , respectively. </p><h2>publication_ref</h2> <p>['b0'] </p><h2>figure_ref</h2> <p>['fig_0'] </p><h2>table_ref</h2> <p>[] </p><h2>heading</h2> <p>Bernoulli Gates </p><h2>text</h2> <p>Bernoulli gates operate as switches, facilitating the transmission of a sample's information from embedding tables to the downstream MLP component. Analogous to the l 0 norm, we hope these \"switches\" to be capable of fully opening or closing without compromising the information integrity (shrinking the embedding representation). Inspired by the approach presented in [18,35], we use Bernoulli gates to predict each sample's relevant dimensions given its embedding representation. The detailed process of the Bernoulli gates is graphically depicted in Figure 2.\nThe Bernoulli gates operate in two distinct modes: stochastic selection and deterministic selection. Under the stochastic selection mode, the gates operate as independent Bernoulli distributions, to independently \"open\" or \"close\" dimensions given the probabilities. The principle behind stochastic selection rests on the assumption that, given a sufficiently large number of training iterations, the gates will stochastically and comprehensively traverse all potential combinations of dimensions. This prompts the Bernoulli parameters to increase for beneficial dimensions and penalize unhelpful ones. Once the Bernoulli distributions (gates) have been fully explored, we capitalize on the learned distribution by deterministically opening the most advantageous dimensions in the deterministic selection mode. However, learned Bernoulli probabilities often exhibit heavy-tailedness, making it challenging to distinguish between important and unimportant dimensions. To mitigate this, we suggest employing a polarization regularizer and an automatic threshold searcher (both discussed in Section 3.3.3) inside Bernoulli gates. </p><h2>publication_ref</h2> <p>['b17', 'b34'] </p><h2>figure_ref</h2> <p>['fig_1'] </p><h2>table_ref</h2> <p>[] </p><h2>heading</h2> <p>Stochastic Selection. </p><h2>text</h2> <p>In our previous discussion, we aim for Bernoulli gates to function as independent Bernoulli distributions in the stochastic selection mode during the searching stage. The first objective is to encode the embedding representations to the desired independent Bernoulli probabilities. To this end, we employ an FC layer (with parameter 𝒘) and a Sigmoid activation layer (𝜎) to project these embedding representations of the 𝑖-th sample onto Bernoulli probabilities (upper left of Figure 2), denoted by {𝑝 𝑖,𝑗 } 𝑁 * 𝑗=1 = 𝜎 (𝒘 𝑬 𝑖 ), where 𝑁 *\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>EMBEDDING LAYER<|>CONCEPT<|>The embedding layer is a component in machine learning models that transforms input data into a low-dimensional representation, facilitating better performance in tasks such as recommendation systems.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MLP COMPONENT<|>CONCEPT<|>The MLP component is a crucial part of Deep Learning Recommendation Models (DLRMs) that encodes embedding representations and predicts recommendations through multiple fully-connected layers and non-linear activation functions.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BERNOULLI GATES<|>CONCEPT<|>Bernoulli gates are mechanisms that act as switches to control the flow of information from embedding tables to the MLP component, operating in stochastic and deterministic modes to optimize the selection of dimensions.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DLRMS<|>CONCEPT<|>Deep Learning Recommendation Models (DLRMs) are advanced models that utilize embedding layers and MLP components to enhance the prediction performance of recommendation systems.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>STOCHASTIC SELECTION<|>CONCEPT<|>Stochastic selection is a mode of operation for Bernoulli gates where dimensions are independently opened or closed based on probabilities, allowing for comprehensive exploration of potential combinations.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DETERMINISTIC SELECTION<|>CONCEPT<|>Deterministic selection is a mode of operation for Bernoulli gates that follows stochastic selection, where the most advantageous dimensions are opened based on learned distributions.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>EMBEDDING LAYER<|>MLP COMPONENT<|>The embedding layer provides low-dimensional representations that are encoded and processed by the MLP component to make predictions<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MLP COMPONENT<|>DLRMS<|>The MLP component is an integral part of DLRMs, responsible for encoding representations and making predictions<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BERNOULLI GATES<|>MLP COMPONENT<|>Bernoulli gates facilitate the transmission of information from embedding tables to the MLP component, impacting the model's performance<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BERNOULLI GATES<|>STOCHASTIC SELECTION<|>Bernoulli gates operate in stochastic selection mode to independently control the opening and closing of dimensions based on probabilities<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BERNOULLI GATES<|>DETERMINISTIC SELECTION<|>After exploring dimensions in stochastic selection, Bernoulli gates switch to deterministic selection to optimize the most beneficial dimensions<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>DLRMS<|>BERNOULLI GATES<|>DLRMs utilize Bernoulli gates to enhance the selection process of embedding dimensions, improving overall model performance<|>5)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
