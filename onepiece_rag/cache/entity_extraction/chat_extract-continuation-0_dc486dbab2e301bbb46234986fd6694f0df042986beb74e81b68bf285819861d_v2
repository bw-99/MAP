We first provide a concise overview of the entire hierarchical training framework. Subsequently, the primary modules within our framework are described, as well as how to optimize them within each hierarchical stage. </p><h2>publication_ref</h2> <p>[] </p><h2>figure_ref</h2> <p>['fig_0'] </p><h2>table_ref</h2> <p>[] </p><h2>heading</h2> <p>Overview </p><h2>text</h2> <p>The methodology for the iHAS framework comprises three stages: searching, clustering, and retraining. It involves three principal modules: deep recommendation models (consisting of an embedding layer and an MLP component) for predicting user preferences, a Bernoulli gates layer responsible for dimension selection, and a K-means cluster algorithm that partitions the heterogeneous data.\nIn the searching stage, the key objective is to identify the optimal, instance-wise embedding dimensions across different fields, thus facilitating an accurate recommendation prediction. As shown in Figure 1, the categorical field features are directed to an embedding layer to generate embedding representations. These representations are then processed through the Bernoulli gates to produce embedding masks using a stochastic selection mode (see Section 3.3.1). Each embedding mask comprises a binary vector that serves as a gate on whether the corresponding dimension should be incorporated into the downstream architecture. Then the framework conducts an element-wise multiplication between a sample's embedding representations and embedding masks. This resultant masked embedding representation is then directed to the base MLP component to predict user preference.\nIn the clustering stage, the main objective is to utilize K-Means algorithm [28] to cluster samples into groups. This stage mostly mirrors the procedure used in the searching stage: using the embedding layer and Bernoulli gates (but using deterministic selection mode, see Section 3.3.2) to calculate the masked embedding representations. These masked embedding representations are then used to train a mini-batch K-Means cluster [28]. As shown in Figure 1, the K-means separates the red and yellow samples from the blue and green samples.\nThe retraining stage aims to develop cluster-customized DLRMs, considering the variation in dimension patterns across different clusters. In each cluster, we calculate the embedding masks (using deterministic selection mode) for all samples. The resultant masks are then averaged to obtain one vector, which is used to determine the final embedding dimensions of each DLRM. </p><h2>publication_ref</h2> <p>['b27', 'b27'] </p><h2>figure_ref</h2> <p>['fig_0', 'fig_0'] </p><h2>table_ref</h2> <p>[] </p><h2>heading</h2> <p>Deep Learning Recommender Models </p><h2>text</h2> <p>In this subsection, we provide a brief introduction to the basic architecture of the DLRM.

The term |𝑛| denotes the number of unique values for 𝑛-th categorical field. For instance, a categorical field such as \"gender\" with unique valuesmale, female, and unknown -can be expressed through three-bit vectors [1, 0, 0], [0, 1, 0], and [0, 0, 1], respectively.\nTo process a numerical field feature, we will discretize it through custom-width binning, followed by applying a one-hot operation.\nThen, the operation of the embedding layer can be represented as:\n𝒆 𝑖,𝑛 = 𝒗 𝑛 𝒙 𝑖,𝑛 ,\nwhere\n𝒗 𝑛 ∈ R 𝑑 × |𝑛 |\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>IHAS FRAMEWORK<|>CONCEPT<|>The iHAS framework is a hierarchical training framework designed for optimizing recommender models through clustering and retraining processes.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DEEP LEARNING RECOMMENDER MODELS<|>CONCEPT<|>Deep Learning Recommender Models (DLRMs) are architectures that utilize embedding layers and MLP components to predict user preferences based on input data.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>K-MEANS CLUSTER ALGORITHM<|>CONCEPT<|>The K-means cluster algorithm is a method used to partition data into distinct groups based on feature similarity, facilitating better data organization for model training.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>IHAS FRAMEWORK<|>DEEP LEARNING RECOMMENDER MODELS<|>The iHAS framework incorporates Deep Learning Recommender Models as part of its methodology for predicting user preferences<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>IHAS FRAMEWORK<|>K-MEANS CLUSTER ALGORITHM<|>The iHAS framework utilizes the K-means cluster algorithm to group samples into clusters for enhanced model training<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>DEEP LEARNING RECOMMENDER MODELS<|>K-MEANS CLUSTER ALGORITHM<|>Deep Learning Recommender Models are trained using the outputs of the K-means cluster algorithm to optimize user preference predictions<|>6)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
