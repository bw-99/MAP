Establishing (167)<h2>text</h2>Positive scalars λ, µ are given in the statement of Proposition 4. We need consider only the case where r n ≤ ⌊ n-ℓ 2 ⌋ for infinitely many n, as otherwise (167) would hold trivially. From n ℓ ≤ n ℓ , n-ℓ r ≤ n r and property (b) of Lemma 6, we get for r = r n + 1, . . . , ⌊ n-ℓ 2 ⌋,\nf n,ℓ,r ≤ n ℓ n r e -perλ + e -Knµ n-ℓ2\n.\nWe will establish (167) in two steps. First set rn = 3 λpe . Obviously, the range r = r n + 1, . . . , ⌊ n-ℓ 2 ⌋ is intersecting the range r = rn , . . . , ⌊ n-ℓ 2 ⌋. We first consider the latter range below. For r = rn , . . . , ⌊ n-ℓ 2 ⌋, it follows that e -perλ ≤ e If rn ≤ r n + 1 for all n sufficiently large, then the desired condition (167) is automatically satisfied via (176). On the other hand, if r n + 1 < rn , we should still consider the range r = r n + 1, . . . , rn -1. On that range, we use arguments similar to those leading to (171) and obtain f n,ℓ,r ≤ n ℓ+r e r (p e ) r-1 e -perλ + e -Knµ n-r-ℓ (177) upon using also property (b) of Lemma 6.
