Wang<h1>pub_date</h1>2021-04-23<h1>abstract</h1>The model-based investing using financial factors is evolving as a principal method for quantitative investment. The main challenge lies in the selection of effective factors towards excess market returns. Existing approaches, either hand-picking factors or applying feature selection algorithms, do not orchestrate both human knowledge and computational power. This paper presents iQUANT, an interactive quantitative investment system that assists equity traders to quickly spot promising financial factors from initial recommendations suggested by algorithmic models, and conduct a joint refinement of factors and stocks for investment portfolio composition. We work closely with professional traders to assemble empirical characteristics of \"good\" factors and propose effective visualization designs to illustrate the collective performance of financial factors, stock portfolios, and their interactions. We evaluate iQUANT through a formal user study, two case studies, and expert interviews, using a real stock market dataset consisting of 3000 stocks × 6000 days × 56 factors.<h1>sections</h1><h2>heading</h2>Introduction<h2>text</h2>Quantitative investment using algorithmic trading has accounted for over 85% of transactions in US stock markets since 2012 [\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>IFIXR<|>ORGANIZATION<|>iFixR is an organization involved in fixing bugs and improving software quality through various patch types.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DEFECTS4J<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Defects4J is a database of real bugs in Java programs used for software testing and research.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>XUANWU YUE<|>PERSON<|>Xuanwu Yue is one of the authors of the paper titled 'iQUANT: Interactive Quantitative Investment Using Sparse Regression Factors'.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>QIAO GU<|>PERSON<|>Qiao Gu is a co-author of the paper titled 'iQUANT: Interactive Quantitative Investment Using Sparse Regression Factors'.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DEYUN WANG<|>PERSON<|>Deyun Wang is a co-author of the paper titled 'iQUANT: Interactive Quantitative Investment Using Sparse Regression Factors'.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>HUAMIN QU<|>PERSON<|>Huamin Qu is a co-author of the paper titled 'iQUANT: Interactive Quantitative Investment Using Sparse Regression Factors'.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>YONG WANG<|>PERSON<|>Yong Wang is a co-author of the paper titled 'iQUANT: Interactive Quantitative Investment Using Sparse Regression Factors'.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>IQUANT<|>EVENT<|>iQUANT is an interactive quantitative investment system designed to assist equity traders in selecting financial factors for investment.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>IFIXR<|>DEFECTS4J<|>iFixR works with Defects4J to address and fix bugs in software applications<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>XUANWU YUE<|>IQUANT<|>Xuanwu Yue contributed to the development of the iQUANT system as a co-author of the related paper<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>QIAO GU<|>IQUANT<|>Qiao Gu contributed to the development of the iQUANT system as a co-author of the related paper<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>DEYUN WANG<|>IQUANT<|>Deyun Wang contributed to the development of the iQUANT system as a co-author of the related paper<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>HUAMIN QU<|>IQUANT<|>Huamin Qu contributed to the development of the iQUANT system as a co-author of the related paper<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>YONG WANG<|>IQUANT<|>Yong Wang contributed to the development of the iQUANT system as a co-author of the related paper<|>8)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
