We formulate this problem in a very abstract form and prove that sorting by k-Pareto optimality yields a valid solution. Next, we show that the proposed theory can be useful in practice. We apply it during the selection step of genetic optimization and demonstrate that the resulting algorithm outperforms existing state-of-the-art approaches such as NSGA-II and NSGA-III. We also demonstrate that the provided general formulation allows discovering interesting relationships and applying the developed theory to different applications. 1 Topological sorting [E. Knuth, 1997]  here means the process of sorting a set of items with respect to a preference or dominance relation. We use the terms preference and dominance interchangeably. 2 We use the terms item and element interchangeably. </p><h1>sections</h1><h2>heading</h2> <p>Introduction </p><h2>text</h2> <p>In the modern era of information overload, the task of choosing a subset of the most useful items is extremely important. Various tools were developed with the aim to assist a user with this task, for example, text search engines [Croft et al., 2010] and recommender systems [Resnick and Varian, 1997]. In most of the cases, such systems suggest to the user a small set of elements 2 . Thereby, if the number of equally preferable options is large, a heuristic is used to discard a fraction of them. However, in some applications the user might be willing to analyze all equally preferable options with the aim to choose the best one. This can happen, for example, in the case of choosing a habitation.\nA similar problem of choosing a subset of most preferable elements also arises as an important step when solving various practical tasks. A straightforward example would be the selection step in genetic optimization algorithms [Mitchell, 1998]. At this step, a subset of the current population is chosen to advance to the next generation. Having the chosen subset made up of elements with large fitness values guides the evolution process in the desired direction. At the same time, selecting a subset with the largest variety of genes ensures variability of characteristics and allows faster exploration of the search space.\nThese examples bring us to the problem of generalizedfoot_0 topological sorting with choice maximisation which we also refer to as maximum choice problem. This problem aims to choose a subset of a predefined maximum size, consisting of most preferable items and containing the largest number of equally preferred elementsfoot_1 . To the best of our knowledge, this problems has not yet been studied in the literature. In this text, we propose a theoretical solution to the maximum choice problem and demonstrate how both the problem and its solution can be applied in practice.\nThe contributions of this work are the following:\n1. We formulate the maximum choice problem in a broad sense for arbitrary elements, preference relations R, and measures µ indicating the set sizes, see Section 2.\n2. We propose a solution based on the concept of k-Pareto optimality, whose definition relies on the relation R, see Section 3.\n3. We further investigate the proposed solution from a theoretical point of view and discover interesting characteristics, such as the relationship between k-Pareto optimal elements and the arc of hyperbola, see Section 4.\n4. Finally, we demonstrate the applicability of our approach to real-world problems by considering genetic optimization, see Section 5. </p><h2>publication_ref</h2> <p>['b1', 'b39'] </p><h2>figure_ref</h2> <p>[] </p><h2>table_ref</h2> <p>[] </p><h2>heading</h2> <p>Sorting with Choice Maximization </p><h2>text</h2> <p>To formally define the problem of maximization of choice, we introduce several definitions in Sections 2.1 and 2.2. The resulting formalization of this problem is abstract and quite general. However, this generality allows discovering novel connections and applying the developed theory to numerous practical problems. We also illustrate the defined concepts with an example in Section 2.3. </p><h2>publication_ref</h2> <p>[] </p><h2>figure_ref</h2> <p>[] </p><h2>table_ref</h2> <p>[] </p><h2>heading</h2> <p>Definitions </p><h2>text</h2> <p>We consider a set X with a binary relation R. Intuitively xRy means that x is preferable to y. The case xRy and not yRx means that x is strictly preferable to y. This situation is denoted by xR * y. We also consider a positive and σ-finite measure µ [Halmos, 2013] defined on X. Thus, we have a measure space (X, Σ, µ), where Σ is a set of subsets of X, and µ\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}}
