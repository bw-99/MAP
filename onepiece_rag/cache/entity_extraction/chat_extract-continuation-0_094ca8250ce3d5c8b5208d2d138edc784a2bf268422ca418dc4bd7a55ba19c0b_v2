Since the number of requirements ùëÄ is static, but each document has a different length (number of text segments) ùëÅ , we initially model the described matching task from a segment-to-requirements perspective as a multi-label classification problem. Formally, for every ùë† ùëñ ‚àà S our recommender model assigns relevance scores to all ùëü ùëó ‚àà R.\nHowever, from the users' point of view, the reverse direction of getting relevant segment recommendations for a specific requirement ùëü ùëó (requirement-to-segments perspective) is far more beneficial. This is especially true because a significant amount of text segments within a sustainability report is unrelated to concrete requirements in R. This is why, based on the assigned relevance scores, our model ranks the text segments per requirement in descending order and subsequently recommends the top ùêæ relevant text blocks to the user.<h2>publication_ref</h2>[]<h2>figure_ref</h2>[]<h2>table_ref</h2>[]<h2>heading</h2>Document Parsing<h2>text</h2>Before we focus on the actual recommender module, the core component of sustain.AI, we briefly touch upon the non-negligible task of document parsing. The large majority of publicly available sustainability reports are published as PDF documents, an inherently difficult format to convert into a structured machine-readable form like XML or JSON. The latter is particularly true for scanned PDF reports that only contain image information.\nTo solve this issue our system utilizes a custom PDF parser (see Figure 2), that is capable of parsing machine-created as well as scanned PDFs with arbitrarily complex formattings. The parser leverages a refined image segmentation technique by combining the powerful object detection network Faster R-CNN [14] with the density-based clustering algorithm DBSCAN [4]. It is also trained to recognize specific elements of a document, such as footers, headers or pagination. For further details about the parser's functionality, we refer to [1].\nAfter the successful PDF parsing we apply some basic textual preprocessing in the form of removing line break hyphens and filtering out irrelevant text segment types like footer, header and table of contents. Our final set of considered segments S consists of titles, paragraphs, enumerations, tables and diagrams.<h2>publication_ref</h2>['b13', 'b3', 'b0']<h2>figure_ref</h2>['fig_0']<h2>table_ref</h2>[]<h2>heading</h2>Recommender System<h2>text</h2>Considering a parsed and processed sustainability report, we use a pretrained BERT [3] model to individually encode each text segment ùë† ùëñ ‚àà S.\nFormally, we first apply WordPiece [15] tokenization to transform an examplary input segment ùë† into a sequence of sub-word tokens ùë° = ([CLS], ùë° 1 , . . . , ùë° ùëõ , [SEP]). Note [CLS] denotes a BERTspecific special token that aggregates the content of the entire segment while [SEP] simply highlights the end of the sequence.\nPassing ùë° to the BERT model with pretrained parameters ùëæ bert yields a sequence of contextual token embeddings ùíâ [CLS] , ùíâ 1 , . . . , ùíâ ùëõ , ùíâ [SEP] , where ùíâ [CLS] represents the aggregated context hidden state for the whole segment ùë†.\nSubsequently, we employ a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) with trainable parameters ùëæ mlp to predict relevance probabilities ≈∑ = [ ≈∑1 , . . . , ≈∑ùëÄ ] ‚àà R ùëÄ for all requirements in R. The classifying MLP consists of a fully-connected hidden layer followed by dropout and ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit) activation functions and a sigmoidal output layer.\nDuring training, we jointly optimize and finetune the parameters of the BERT model ùëæ bert and the classification layer ùëæ mlp to minimize the Binary Cross Entropy (BCE) loss between target labels ùíö and predicted probabilities ≈∑.\nFinally, after assigning relevance scores over requirements for all ùë† ùëñ ‚àà S, we sort the segments for each requirement ùëü ùëó in descending order in order to recommend the top ùêæ relevant text blocks. <h2>publication_ref</h2>['b2', 'b14']<h2>figure_ref</h2>[]<h2>table_ref</h2>[]<h2>heading</h2>EXPERIMENTS<h2>text</h2>In the following sections, we introduce our two custom data sets of German sustainability reports, define our evaluation metrics, discuss the overall training setup, describe the competing baseline methods, and finally, evaluate results.<h2>publication_ref</h2>[]<h2>figure_ref</h2>[]<h2>\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>SUSTAINABILITY REPORT<|>EVENT<|>A sustainability report is a document that outlines a company's environmental, social, and governance (ESG) performance and impacts.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BERT<|>ORGANIZATION<|>BERT is a pretrained model used for natural language processing tasks, including encoding text segments for relevance scoring.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PDF<|>ORGANIZATION<|>PDF is a file format used for presenting documents in a manner independent of application software, hardware, and operating systems.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>FASTER R-CNN<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Faster R-CNN is an object detection network used for parsing documents and recognizing specific elements within them.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DBSCAN<|>ORGANIZATION<|>DBSCAN is a density-based clustering algorithm used in conjunction with Faster R-CNN for image segmentation in document parsing.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MACHINE-READABLE FORM<|>EVENT<|>A structured format like XML or JSON that allows for easier data processing and analysis.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MULTI-LABEL CLASSIFICATION<|>EVENT<|>A classification problem where multiple labels can be assigned to each instance, relevant in matching text segments to requirements.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>RECOMMENDER SYSTEM<|>EVENT<|>A system designed to suggest relevant text segments based on user requirements and relevance scores.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>TEXT SEGMENT<|>EVENT<|>A distinct part of a document, such as a paragraph, title, table, or diagram, used in the analysis of sustainability reports.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>REGULATORY CHECKLIST<|>EVENT<|>A set of requirements that sustainability reports must adhere to, ensuring compliance with legal standards.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SUSTAINABILITY REPORT<|>RECOMMENDER SYSTEM<|>The recommender system analyzes sustainability reports to suggest relevant text segments based on regulatory requirements<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BERT<|>RECOMMENDER SYSTEM<|>BERT is utilized within the recommender system to encode text segments for relevance scoring<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PDF<|>MACHINE-READABLE FORM<|>PDF documents are often converted into machine-readable formats like XML or JSON for easier processing<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>FASTER R-CNN<|>PDF<|>Faster R-CNN is used to parse PDF documents, enabling the extraction of structured information<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>DBSCAN<|>FASTER R-CNN<|>DBSCAN is employed alongside Faster R-CNN for effective image segmentation in document parsing<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MULTI-LABEL CLASSIFICATION<|>REGULATORY CHECKLIST<|>The multi-label classification approach is used to match text segments to multiple regulatory requirements<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>TEXT SEGMENT<|>SUSTAINABILITY REPORT<|>Text segments are the building blocks of sustainability reports, providing detailed information<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>RECOMMENDER SYSTEM<|>REGULATORY CHECKLIST<|>The recommender system aims to identify relevant text segments for each regulatory requirement<|>7)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
