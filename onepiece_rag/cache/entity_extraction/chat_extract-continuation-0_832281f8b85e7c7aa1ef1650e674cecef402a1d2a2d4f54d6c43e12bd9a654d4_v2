In contrast, HGCN (as depicted in the lower left) fails to grasp the intricate topology in this area. These observations further attest to the efficacy of our proposed method in uncovering local clusters and mitigating the distortions imposed by hyperbolic geometry. </p><h2>publication_ref</h2> <p>['b41', 'b42', 'b43', 'b44'] </p><h2>figure_ref</h2> <p>['fig_4', 'fig_4', 'fig_4'] </p><h2>table_ref</h2> <p>[] </p><h2>heading</h2> <p>CONCLUSION </p><h2>text</h2> <p>For modeling tree-like structures, the hyperbolic space has demonstrated its ability to capture hierarchical relationships. However, approximating a discrete tree-like graph with a hyperbolic manifold can result in inevitable distortions, as real-world tree-like graphs are inherently complex. In this work, we integrate the intrinsic graph structure into the continuous hyperbolic embedding space via the discrete Ricci curvature. As expected, the graph curvature facilitates the node to perceive the role and the hierarchy it belongs to, helping accelerate the hierarchical formation as well as alleviate the distortion in local clusters or cliques. The superiority of the proposal is demonstrated by extensive experiments. Curvature is a geometric notion with appealing and descriptive properties for both network and continuous space. Via the interaction of curvatures, we can build proper connections for a graph and the embedding space to obtain high-quality representations, which is a promising direction to advance geometric learning. In the future, we will consider the use of Ricci flow, a more sophisticated geometric concept derived from Ricci curvature, to further enhance graph embedding and graph machine learning in tree-likeness modeling. </p><h2>publication_ref</h2> <p>[] </p><h2>figure_ref</h2> <p>[] </p><h2>table_ref</h2> <p>[] </p><h2>heading</h2> <p>APPENDIX A DATASETS </p><h2>text</h2> <p>In this section, we provide details about the datasets used in our study. The Disease dataset contains nodes that are labeled as infected or not infected with a disease, with features indicating their susceptibility to the disease. The disease-spreading network in this dataset displays a clear hierarchical structure, which makes it ideal for testing the effectiveness of hyperbolic embedding models. We use this dataset to validate our proposal. The Airport dataset consists of nodes representing airports, with edges indicating the existence of routes between two airports and labels reflecting the population of the respective country that the airport belongs to. In contrast, the PubMed and Cora datasets represent scientific papers as nodes, with edges indicating citations and labels corresponding to academic subfields. Additionally, the Disease and Airport datasets have imbalanced node labels, rendering accuracy an inadequate measure of model performance. Therefore, we use the F1 score as a more suitable measure for imbalanced datasets. Conversely, for the remaining datasets with balanced node classes, we use accuracy to evaluate the models. Furthermore, note that according to the official code of HGCN 5 , the data statistics for Disease in node classification and link prediction differ slightly, and we list them separately in Table 2 for clarity.\nHyperbolicity 𝛿 is a metric that quantifies how closely a graph resembles a tree structure, with lower values of 𝛿 indicating greater tree-like characteristics. A 𝛿 value of 0 corresponds to a tree, while higher hyperbolicity values indicate a less tree-like structure. The relationship between hyperbolicity and tree-like characteristics has been established in various studies, including [3,32,53]. </p><h2>publication_ref</h2> <p>['b2', 'b31', 'b52'] </p><h2>figure_ref</h2> <p>[] </p><h2>table_ref</h2> <p>['tab_2'] </p><h2>heading</h2> <p>B HYPERBOLIC GEOMETRY </p><h2>text</h2> <p>The geometry of a Riemannian manifold is defined by its curvature: elliptic geometry for positive curvature, Euclidean geometry for zero curvature, and hyperbolic geometry for negative curvature. In this study, we concentrate on the latter, i.e. hyperbolic geometry. There exist several equivalent hyperbolic models that exhibit diverse characteristics, yet are mathematically isometric. Our main focus will be on two extensively researched hyperbolic models.: the Poincaré ball model [56] and the Lorentz model (also known as the hyperboloid model) [57]. Let ∥.∥ be the Euclidean norm and ⟨., .⟩ L denote the Minkowski inner product, respectively. The two models are denoted by Definition B.1 and Definition B.2. A compilation of the formulas and operations associated with these models, such as distance, mapping, and parallel transport, is presented in Table 6. These operations include Möbius addition [75] denoted by ⊕ 𝜅 and the gyration operator [75]  </p><h2>publication_ref</h2> <p>['b55', 'b56', 'b74', 'b74'] </p><h2>figure_ref</h2> <p>[] </p><h2>table_ref</h2> <p>['tab_7'] </\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>HGCN<|>CONCEPT<|>HGCN is a method that identifies local triangle structures in graphs and promotes inter-node message exchange, demonstrating efficacy in uncovering local clusters and mitigating distortions from hyperbolic geometry.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>HYPERBOLIC GEOMETRY<|>CONCEPT<|>Hyperbolic geometry is a type of non-Euclidean geometry characterized by negative curvature, which is significant in modeling complex structures like tree-like graphs.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>RICCI CURVATURE<|>CONCEPT<|>Ricci curvature is a geometric concept used to integrate graph structures into continuous hyperbolic embedding spaces, facilitating the understanding of hierarchical relationships in graphs.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DISEASE DATASET<|>EVENT<|>The Disease dataset is used to study the spread of disease through a network of nodes labeled as infected or not, ideal for testing hyperbolic embedding models.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>AIRPORT DATASET<|>EVENT<|>The Airport dataset consists of nodes representing airports and edges indicating routes, used to evaluate hyperbolic embedding models based on population data.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PUBMED DATASET<|>EVENT<|>The PubMed dataset represents scientific papers as nodes with edges indicating citations, used for academic research and evaluation of hyperbolic models.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CORA DATASET<|>EVENT<|>The Cora dataset is similar to PubMed, representing scientific papers and their citations, utilized for testing hyperbolic embedding models.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>HGCN<|>HYPERBOLIC GEOMETRY<|>HGCN utilizes hyperbolic geometry to enhance the understanding of local structures in graphs<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>RICCI CURVATURE<|>HYPERBOLIC GEOMETRY<|>Ricci curvature is a concept derived from hyperbolic geometry that aids in graph embedding<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>DISEASE DATASET<|>HGCN<|>The Disease dataset is used to validate the effectiveness of the HGCN method in modeling disease spread<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>AIRPORT DATASET<|>HGCN<|>The Airport dataset is utilized to evaluate the performance of hyperbolic embedding models like HGCN<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PUBMED DATASET<|>HGCN<|>The PubMed dataset is used to assess the effectiveness of hyperbolic models in academic citation networks<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CORA DATASET<|>HGCN<|>The Cora dataset serves a similar purpose as PubMed, testing hyperbolic embedding models<|>6)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
