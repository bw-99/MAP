Typical RecSys handle large embedding tables and many embedding table related operations. The memory size and bandwidth of the conventional computer architecture restrict the performance of RecSys. This work proposes an in-memory-computing (IMC) architecture (iMARS) for accelerating the filtering and ranking stages of deep neural network-based RecSys. iMARS leverages IMC-friendly embedding tables implemented inside a ferroelectric FET based IMC fabric. Circuit-level and systemlevel evaluation show that iMARS achieves 16.8× (713×) endto-end latency (energy) improvement compared to the GPU counterpart for the MovieLens dataset.<h1>sections</h1><h2>heading</h2>I. INTRODUCTION<h2>text</h2>Recommendation systems (RecSys) have been used in various applications to suggest items such as movies, music, books, shopping items, websites, etc. based on a user's previous behavior, as well as historical data from other users. The large amount of available data allows RecSys to leverage deep neural networks (DNN). DNN-based RecSys have been widely adopted by companies like Facebook [1] and Google [2] to improve their online services.\nThe typical DNN-based RecSys inference process [2] includes two stages: filtering and ranking. In the filtering stage, the system selects a set of candidate items from a large item database to be recommended based on a user's behavior. The ranking stage then computes the probability of choosing each candidate item. The items with the highest probability are finally returned to the user. Both the filtering and ranking stage use embedding tables (ETs) to capture and store user behaviors and item characteristics. The large ETs make the operations on them memory-bandwidth limited.\nSeveral algorithm and hardware solutions, e.g., ET compression [3], have been proposed to alleviate the memorybandwidth bottleneck. Near-memory computing has also been leveraged to solve the memory-bandwidth problem by bringing the compute units closer to the memory [4]. However, these solutions only focus on the ranking stage and not the filtering stage which are still impeded by memory bottlenecks due to the huge amount of data transfers.\nIn-memory-computing (IMC) is a computational paradigm that can alleviate the data transfer overhead between the memory and the compute unit by performing logic and arithmetic operations inside the memory unit itself. Different IMC kernels have been proposed, such\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>IMARS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>iMARS is an in-memory-computing architecture designed to accelerate recommendation systems by improving performance in filtering and ranking stages.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MENGYUAN LI<|>PERSON<|>Mengyuan Li is one of the authors of the paper discussing the iMARS architecture.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ANN FRANCHESCA LAGUNA<|>PERSON<|>Ann Franchesca Laguna is a co-author of the paper on iMARS.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DAYANE REIS<|>PERSON<|>Dayane Reis is a co-author of the iMARS paper.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>XUNZHAO YIN<|>PERSON<|>Xunzhao Yin is a co-author of the paper discussing the iMARS architecture.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MICHAEL NIEMIER<|>PERSON<|>Michael Niemier is a co-author of the iMARS paper.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SHARON HU<|>PERSON<|>Sharon Hu is a co-author of the paper on iMARS.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>FACEBOOK<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Facebook is a company that has adopted DNN-based recommendation systems to enhance its online services.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GOOGLE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Google is a company that utilizes DNN-based recommendation systems to improve its online services.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MOVIELENS<|>EVENT<|>MovieLens is a dataset used for evaluating the performance of recommendation systems, particularly in the context of the iMARS architecture.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MENGYUAN LI<|>IMARS<|>Mengyuan Li is one of the authors contributing to the development of the iMARS architecture<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ANN FRANCHESCA LAGUNA<|>IMARS<|>Ann Franchesca Laguna is a co-author contributing to the iMARS architecture<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>DAYANE REIS<|>IMARS<|>Dayane Reis is a co-author contributing to the iMARS architecture<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>XUNZHAO YIN<|>IMARS<|>Xunzhao Yin is a co-author contributing to the iMARS architecture<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MICHAEL NIEMIER<|>IMARS<|>Michael Niemier is a co-author contributing to the iMARS architecture<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SHARON HU<|>IMARS<|>Sharon Hu is a co-author contributing to the iMARS architecture<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>FACEBOOK<|>IMARS<|>Facebook utilizes DNN-based recommendation systems, which may benefit from architectures like iMARS<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>GOOGLE<|>IMARS<|>Google utilizes DNN-based recommendation systems, which may benefit from architectures like iMARS<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MOVIELENS<|>IMARS<|>The MovieLens dataset is used to evaluate the performance of the iMARS architecture<|>7)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
