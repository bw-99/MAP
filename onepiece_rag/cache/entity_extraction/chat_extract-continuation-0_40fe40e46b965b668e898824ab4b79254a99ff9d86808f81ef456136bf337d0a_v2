(64\n)\nfor each ℓ = 0, 1, . . .. Using (64) and the fact that the events A h (h = 0, 1, . . . , ℓ) are mutually exclusive, we obtain\nP D x,ℓ ∩ D y,ℓ ∩ E xy = ℓ h=0 P A h ∩ E xy . (65\n)\nWe begin computing the right hand side (R.H.S.) of (65) by evaluating E xy . From (2), we have\nE xy = K xy ∩ C xy . Hence E xy = K xy ∪ C xy = K xy ∪ (K xy ∩ C xy ).(66)\nAlso, by definition we have\nK xy = Kn u=1 (|S xy | = u).(67)\nFor each u = 1, 2, . . . , K n , we define event X u as follows:\nX u = (|S xy | = u) ∩ C xy(68)\nApplying (67) to (66) and using (68), we obtain\nE xy = K xy ∪ Kn u=1 (|S xy | = u) ∩ C xy = K xy ∪ Kn u=1 X u .(69)\nFrom (69) and the fact that the events K xy , X 1 , X 2 , . . . , X Kn are mutually disjoint, we obtain\nP A h ∩ E xy = P A h ∩ K xy + Kn u=1 P [A h ∩ X u ] .(70)\nSubstituting (70) into (65), we get\nP D x,ℓ ∩ D y,ℓ ∩ E xy = ℓ h=0 P A h ∩ K xy + ℓ h=0 Kn u=1 P [A h ∩ X u ] .(71)\nProposition 1 will follow from the next two results.\nProposition 1.1. Let ℓ be a non-negative integer constant. If p s = o(1), p e = ln n+(k-1) ln ln n+αn n with lim n→∞ α n = -∞, then\nℓ h=0 P A h ∩ K xy ∼ (ℓ!) -2 (p e n) 2ℓ e -2pen . (72\n)\nProposition 1.2. Let ℓ be a non-negative integer constant. Consider p s = o(1), K n ≥ 2 for all n sufficiently large and p e = ln n+(k-1) ln ln n+αn n with lim n→∞ α n = -∞. Then, the following two properties hold.\n(a) If there exists an ǫ > 0 such that p e n > ǫ for all n sufficiently large, then we have\nℓ h=0 Kn u=1 P [A h ∩ X u ] = o ℓ h=0 P A h ∩ K xy . (73\n) (b) We have Kn u=1 P [A 0 ∩ X u ] = o P A 0 ∩ K xy .(74)\nIn order to see why Proposition 1 follows from Propositions 1.1 and 1.2, consider p s and p e as stated in Proposition 1. Then from Propositions 1.1 and 1.2, (72) and (73) hold. Substituting (72) and ( 73) into (71), we get (58). Also, using (72) with ℓ = 0 we get P A 0 ∩ K xy ∼ e -2pen . Using this and (74) in (71) with ℓ = 0, we obtain (59) and Proposition 1 is then established. The rest of this section is devoted to establishing Propositions 1.1 and 1.2.
