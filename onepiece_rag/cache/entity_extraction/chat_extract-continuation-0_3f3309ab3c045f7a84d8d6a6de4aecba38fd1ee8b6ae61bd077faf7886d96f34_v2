To implement the actual recommender algorithm we need to implement a creator function which takes a training data set, trains a model and provides a predict function which uses the model to create recommendations for new data. The model and the predict function are both encapsulated in an object of class Recommender.\nFor examples look at the files starting with RECOM in the packages R directory. A good examples is in RECOM_POPULAR.R.<h2>publication_ref</h2>[]<h2>figure_ref</h2>[]<h2>table_ref</h2>[]<h2>heading</h2>Conclusion<h2>text</h2>In this paper we described the R extension package recommenderlab which is especially geared towards developing and testing recommender algorithms. The package allows to create evaluation schemes following accepted methods and then use them to evaluate and compare recommender algorithms. recommenderlab currently includes several standard algorithms and adding new recommender algorithms to the package is facilitated by the built in registry mechanism to manage algorithms. In the future we will add more and more of these algorithms to the package and we hope that some algorithms will also be contributed by other researchers. <h2>publication_ref</h2>[]<h2>figure_ref</h2>[]<h2>table_ref</h2>[]<h2>heading</h2><h2>text</h2>filtering Java http://mahout.apache.org/ Crab Components to create recommender systems Python https://github.com/muricoca/crab LensKit Collaborative filtering algorithms from GroupLens Research Python http://lenskit.grouplens.org/ MyMediaLite factorization C++ https://www.jmlr.org/papers/v13/chen12a.html Vogoo PHP LIB //sourceforge.net/projects://github.com/mhahsler/recommenderlab<h2>publication_ref</h2>[]<h2>figure_ref</h2>[]<h2>table_ref</h2>[]<h2>heading</h2>Affiliation:<h2>text</h2>Michael Hahsler Computer Science Lyle School of Engineering Southern Methodist University P.O.
