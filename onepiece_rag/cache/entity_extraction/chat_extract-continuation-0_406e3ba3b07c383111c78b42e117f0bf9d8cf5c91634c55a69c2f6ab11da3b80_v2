A Proof of Proposition 1.2 </p><h2>text</h2> <p>Notice that (74) can be obtained from (73) by setting ‚Ñì = 0. Thus, in the discussion given below, we will establish (73) for each ‚Ñì = 0, 1, . . . under p e n = ‚Ñ¶(1), and show that this extra condition is not needed if ‚Ñì = 0.\nWe start by finding an upper bound on the left hand side (L.H.S.) of (73). Given the definition of X u in (68), we obtain\nP [A h ‚à© X u ] ‚â§ P [A h ‚à© (|S xy | = u)] .\nThen, we have\n‚Ñì h=0 Kn u=1 P [A h ‚à© X u ] ‚â§ ‚Ñì h=0 Kn u=1 P [A h ‚à© (|S xy | = u)] = Kn u=1 P[|S xy | = u] ‚Ä¢ ‚Ñì h=0 P [A h | (|S xy | = u)] . (87)\nTo compute the R.H.S. of (87), we first use Lemma 10 to get\nP[|S xy | = u] ‚â§ 1 u! K 2 n P n -K n u .(88)\nNext, we compute\nP [A h | (|S xy | = u)]\n. Given (63), we let m 1 = h and m 2 = m 3 = ‚Ñìh in Lemma 4 and obtain\nP [A h | (|S xy | = u)] ‚àº n 2‚Ñì-h h![(‚Ñì -h)!] 2 ‚Ä¢ e -2pen+ pepnu Kn n √ó P[E xj‚à©yj | (|S xy | = u)] h √ó P[E xj‚à©yj | (|S xy | = u)] ‚Ñì-h √ó P[E xj‚à©yj | (|S xy | = u)] ‚Ñì-h . (89\n)\nFrom E xj = C xj ‚à© K xj and E yj = C yj ‚à© K yj , it is clear that E xj and E yj are independent of (|S xy | = u). This leads\nP[E xj‚à©yj | (|S xy | = u)] ‚â§ P[E xj | (|S xy | = u)] = p e (90) P[E xj‚à©yj | (|S xy | = u)] ‚â§ P[E xj | (|S xy | = u)] = p e (91) P[E xj‚à©yj | (|S xy | = u)] ‚â§ P[E yj | (|S xy | = u)] = p e .
