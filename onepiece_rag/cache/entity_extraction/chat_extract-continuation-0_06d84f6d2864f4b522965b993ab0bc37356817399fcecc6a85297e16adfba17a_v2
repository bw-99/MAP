A CF algorithm recommends items of interest to the target user by leveraging the votes given by other similar users. In a standard CF framework, it is assumed that the credibility of every voting user is exactly the same with respect to the target user. This assumption is not satisfied and may lead to misleading recommendations in practice. A natural countermeasure is to design a trust-aware CF algorithm, which can take account of the difference in the credibilities of the voting users when performing CF. To this end, this paper presents a trust inference approach, which can predict the implicit trust of the target user on every voting user from a sparse explicit trust matrix. Then an improved CF algorithm termed iTrace is proposed, which employs both the explicit and the predicted implicit trust to provide recommendations. An empirical evaluation on a public dataset demonstrates that the proposed algorithm provides a significant improvement in recommendation quality in terms of mean absolute error. </p><h1>sections</h1><h2>heading</h2> <p>INTRODUCTION </p><h2>text</h2> <p>With the massive growth of the internet and the emergence of electronic commerce over the last decades, recommender system (RecSys) has become an indispensable technique to mitigate the problem of information overload for users. The aim of RecSys is to provide target users with high quality, personalized recommendations, and to help them find items ‚ãÜ Correspondence author: Bin Liu (Email: bins@ieee.org).

The underlying idea of CF is that users with similar preferences in the past are likely to favor the same items (e.g., books, movies, news, music, etc.) in the future. The CF method is easy to implement. A typical CF method predicts the rating value user u gives to item i as follows [2]:\nr u,i = ru + v‚ààU w(u, v)(r v,i -rv ) v‚ààU |w(u, v)| ,(1)\nwhere U denotes a set of K neighbors of u who rated item i (also called u ‚Ä≤ s voting users in what follows), ru the average rating of user u for all the items rated by u, and w(u, v) the weight assigned to user v ‚Ä≤ s vote when she recommends items to u. In a standard CF framework, the weight w(u, v) is set as a similarity measure between users u and v, denoted by sim(u, v), and the neighbors of u are those most similar to u who co-rated item i with u. In order to compute the similarity between users, a variety of similarity measures have been proposed, such as Pearson correlation, cosine vector similarity, Spearman correlation, entropy-based uncertainty, and meansquare difference. It is reported that Pearson correlation performs better than the others [5,6]. The Pearson correlation coefficient is used here, defined as follows [3,7] sim\n(u, v) = i‚ààI (r u,i -ru )(r v,i -rv ) i‚ààI (r u,i -ru ) 2 i‚ààI (r v,i -rv ) 2 , (2\n) where I denotes the set of items that users u and v have corated.\nIn practical applications, users in general only rate a small portion of items, but accurate recommendations are expected for the cold users who rate only a few items. This raises two inherent obstacles to obtain satisfactory recommending quality, namely data sparsity and cold start [8][9][10][11]. In principle, this is caused by the lack of sufficient and reliable elements in U and/or I to calculate Eqns.( 1) and (2). A possible solution to get around this is to incorporate trust relationships into the CF framework, resulting in the trust based or trust-aware CF (TaCF) [8][9][10][12][13][14]. The underlying intuition supporting the working of trust-aware recommender systems (TaRS) is that users often accept advice from trustworthy friends in real life on topics they are not expert in. So it is reasonable to expect that considering trust relationship among users may bring in benefits in generating recommendations. Furthermore, trust can be propagated over a network of users, hence TaRS can overcome the data sparsity and cold start problems, from which traditional CF methods suffer, at least in concept.\nA practical issue to be considered when designing a TaCF algorithm is that the explicit trust information is usually much more sparse than the users' ratings. A trust propagation model along with an effective implicit trust inference method is desirable to overcome the above limitation. To this end, this paper presents an applicable implicit trust inference method, based on which an improved CF algorithm termed iTrace (i.e., Implicit TRust-Aware Collaborative filtEring) is proposed. </p><h2>publication_ref</h2> <p>['b0', 'b1', 'b2', 'b3', 'b1', 'b4', 'b\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>COLLABORATIVE FILTERING<|>concept<|>Collaborative filtering (CF) algorithms are recommender systems that suggest items to users based on the preferences and votes of similar users.)\n(\"entity\"<|>RECOMMENDER SYSTEMS<|>concept<|>Recommender systems (RecSys) are tools designed to provide personalized recommendations to users, helping them find items of interest from a large selection.)\n(\"entity\"<|>TRUST-AWARE CF<|>concept<|>Trust-aware collaborative filtering (TaCF) algorithms consider the credibility of voting users to improve recommendation accuracy.)\n(\"entity\"<|>TRUST INFERENCE<|>concept<|>Trust inference is a method used to predict the implicit trust a target user has for other users based on a sparse explicit trust matrix.)\n(\"entity\"<|>ITRACE<|>concept<|>iTrace is an improved collaborative filtering algorithm that utilizes both explicit and predicted implicit trust to enhance recommendation quality.)\n(\"entity\"<|>PUBLIC DATASET<|>concept<|>A public dataset is used for empirical evaluation of the proposed iTrace algorithm to demonstrate its effectiveness in improving recommendation quality.)\n(\"entity\"<|>DATA SPARSITY<|>concept<|>Data sparsity refers to the challenge in recommendation systems where users have rated only a small portion of available items, making it difficult to generate accurate recommendations.)\n(\"entity\"<|>COLD START<|>concept<|>Cold start is a problem in recommendation systems where new users or items lack sufficient data for generating reliable recommendations.)\n(\"entity\"<|>PEARSON CORRELATION<|>concept<|>Pearson correlation is a statistical measure used to compute the similarity between users based on their ratings, often used in collaborative filtering.)\n(\"relationship\"<|>COLLABORATIVE FILTERING<|>RECOMMENDER SYSTEMS<|>Collaborative filtering is a widely used technique within recommender systems to provide personalized recommendations<|>9)\n(\"relationship\"<|>TRUST-AWARE CF<|>COLLABORATIVE FILTERING<|>Trust-aware CF enhances traditional collaborative filtering by incorporating user trust into the recommendation process<|>8)\n(\"relationship\"<|>TRUST INFERENCE<|>TRUST-AWARE CF<|>Trust inference is a key component of trust-aware CF, predicting user trust to improve recommendations<|>7)\n(\"relationship\"<|>ITRACE<|>TRUST INFERENCE<|>iTrace utilizes trust inference to enhance its recommendations by considering both explicit and implicit trust<|>8)\n(\"relationship\"<|>PUBLIC DATASET<|>ITRACE<|>The public dataset is used to empirically evaluate the performance of the iTrace algorithm<|>6)\n(\"relationship\"<|>DATA SPARSITY<|>COLD START<|>Data sparsity and cold start are inherent challenges faced by recommendation systems, affecting their ability to provide accurate recommendations<|>7)\n(\"relationship\"<|>PEARSON CORRELATION<|>COLLABORATIVE FILTERING<|>Pearson correlation is a similarity measure used in collaborative filtering to assess user preferences<|>6) \n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
