Unfortunately, projects Joda-Time, JFreeChart and Closure have migrated their source code repositories and issue tracking systems into GitHub without a proper reassignment of bug report identifiers. Therefore, for these projects, bug IDs referred to in the commit logs are ambiguous (for some bugs this may match with the GitHub issue tracking numbering, while in others, it refers to the original issue tracker). To avoid introducing noise in our validation data, we simply drop these projects. For the remaining projects (Lang and Math), we leverage the bug linking strategies implemented in the Jira issue tracking software. We use a similar approach to Fischer et al. [15] and Thomas et al. [78] to link to commits to corresponding bug reports. Concretely, we crawled the bug reports related to each project and assessed the links with a two-step search strategy: (i)\nwe check commit logs to identify bug report IDs and associate the corresponding changes as bug fix changes; then (ii) we check for bug reports that are indeed considered as such (i.e., tagged as \"BUG\") and are further marked as resolved (i.e., with tags \"RESOLVED\" or \"FIXED\"), and completed (i.e., with status \"CLOSED\"). Eventually, our evaluation dataset includes 156 faults (i.e., De-fects4J bugs). Actually, for the considered projects, Defects4J enumerates 171 bugs associated with 162 bug reports: 15 bugs are indeed left out because either (1) the corresponding bug reports are not in the desired status in the bug tracking system, which may lead to noisy data, or (2) there is ambiguity in the buggy program version (e.g., some fixed files appear to be missing in the repository at the time of bug reporting). </p><h2>publication_ref</h2> <p>['b14', 'b77'] </p><h2>figure_ref</h2> <p>[] </p><h2>table_ref</h2> <p>[] </p><h2>heading</h2> <p>Test suite reorganization. </p><h2>text</h2> <p>We ensure that the benchmark separates past test cases (i.e., regression test cases) from future test cases (i.e., test cases that encode functional requirements specified after the bug is reported).

As highlighted in Section 2, for over 90% cases of bugs in the De-fects4J benchmark, the test cases relevant to the defective behavior was actually provided along the bug fixing patches.
