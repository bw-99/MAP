However, road quality information is the crucial aspect that enables drivers safe and comfort trips was not considered in the most of route planning systems [14]. Deteriorated road surface conditions can lead to vehicle damage and dangerous driving scenarios that result in drivers' frustration and stress [14,15]. Consequently, existing land vehicles are considered mobile sensor hubs with various sensing and communications capabilities [16]. Vehicle motion sensors in the land vehicles along with the inertial sensors embedded in the drivers' smart devices enabled adequate detection for various road surface types and anomalies. Thanks to both GPS receivers and inertial sensors the detected anomalies are robustly geo-referenced [17,18].\nIn this paper, we present iDriveSense a corwdsensed based Road Information Services (RIS) system. In this system, we leverage the sensing capabilities of the land vehicles and drivers' smart devices to generate detailed data sets of the road surface types and anomalies with different severity levels. Also, these datasets are used as an input to a cloud-based Fuzzy Inference System (FIS) utilized for road segment assessments. Moreover, iDriveSense provides independent route planning or through evaluating potential routes suggested by trip planning service providers like Google Maps. Route suggestions and evaluations are enabled to the drivers through another FIS. </p><h2>publication_ref</h2> <p>['b0', 'b1', 'b2', 'b3', 'b3', 'b4', 'b5', 'b6', 'b7', 'b8', 'b9', 'b5', 'b9', 'b10', 'b11', 'b12', 'b13', 'b13', 'b14', 'b15', 'b16', 'b17'] </p><h2>figure_ref</h2> <p>[] </p><h2>table_ref</h2> <p>[] </p><h2>heading</h2> <p>II. SYSTEM STRUCTURE </p><h2>text</h2> <p>In this section, we present the system configuration used to build iDriveSense. As mentioned earlier, in this system land vehicles are considered as mobile crowdsensing nodes. As shown in fig. 1, detailed and descriptive datasets of road surface conditions are sent to a cloud RIS. Accordingly, road segments assessment and route recommendations are provided through cascaded FIS. </p><h2>publication_ref</h2> <p>[] </p><h2>figure_ref</h2> <p>[] </p><h2>table_ref</h2> <p>[] </p><h2>heading</h2> <p>A. FIS </p><h2>text</h2> <p>Basically, fuzzy logic is intended to deal with real-world applications through framework able to deal with ambiguity and inaccuracy [19]. In fuzzy logic, quantified rules or statements are adopted to avoid firm true or false decisions. Accordingly, fuzzy logic sets grant objects values that range from 0 to 1 through graded memberships. Therefore, FIS maps sets of given inputs to outputs with the aid of fuzzy logic. Fig. 1 iDriveSense system architecture Fig. 2 FIS system Structure.\nIn addition, FIS dynamic performance is modeled by sets of linguistic descriptive rules that are set according to the system designer prior knowledge [19]. For example, the fuzzy rules of a multiple-input-single-output (MISO) fuzzy system are given by\nR1: if (a) is X1 and (b) is Y1, then (c) is Z1; R2: if (a) is X2 and (b) is Y2, then (c) is Z2;(1)\n……….\nRn: if (a) is Xn and (b) is Yn, then (c) is Zn;\nAs a, b and c are linguistic variables representing two inputs process state variables and one output variable. While, Xi and Yi are linguistic values of the linguistic a, b in the universe of discourse U and V with i = 1, 2, … , n. The linguistics values Zi of the linguistic variable c in the universe of discourse W in case of Mamdani FIS [20].\nFundamentally, as shown in fig. 2, four components together represent the FIS. The fuzzy rules which can be called \"IF-THEN\" are built according to the prior knowledge of the required system. Also, the input domain crisp values U are outlined with fuzzy sets defined in the same universe of disclosure by the aid the fuzzification stage. On the other hand, an inverted operation is carried by the defuzzification stage to map the crisp values of the output domain V with the predefined fuzzy sets. Further details on FIS structure and derivations can be found in [21]. </p><h2>publication_ref</h2> <p>['b18', 'b18', 'b19', 'b20'] </p><h2>figure_ref</h2> <p>[] </p><h2>table_ref</h2> <p>[] </p><h2>heading</h2> <p>B.
