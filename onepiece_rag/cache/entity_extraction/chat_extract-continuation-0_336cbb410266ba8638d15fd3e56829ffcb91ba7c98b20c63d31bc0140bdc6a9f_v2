For these reasons, we employ a FeFET-based CMA design for accelerating RecSys.<h2>publication_ref</h2>['b4', 'b13', 'b6', 'b14', 'b6', 'b7', 'b8', 'b14', 'b7', 'b8', 'b14', 'b15', 'b16', 'b7', 'b8', 'b9', 'b9']<h2>figure_ref</h2>[]<h2>table_ref</h2>[]<h2>heading</h2>III. IMC ACCELERATOR FOR RECOMMENDATION SYSTEMS<h2>text</h2>We propose iMARS, an architecture for RecSys that uses an IMC fabric to accelerate the DNN stack and ET related operations in both the filtering and ranking stage of RecSys. The RecSys ranking and filtering stages use sparse and dense features in determining which items to recommend to the user. The dense features are sent to the DNN stack while the sparse features are sent to ETs. For the DNN stack, crossbars can be readily leveraged. For ET related operations, we leverage CMAs and adder trees placed in the memory periphery. Since different ETs play different roles depending on the stage, how to organize these tables inside the IMC fabric must be considered carefully. We elaborate our proposed architecture in Sec. III-A and computation mapping in Sec. III-C.<h2>publication_ref</h2>[]<h2>figure_ref</h2>[]<h2>table_ref</h2>[]<h2>heading</h2>A. iMARS Architecture<h2>text</h2>The iMARS architecture, shown in Fig. 3(a), consists of two types of IMC arrays: Crossbar arrays for the DNN stack (bottom) and CMA arrays for the ETs (top). The implementation of the DNN and the ETs inside iMARS is described below.\n1) Embedding Tables: Some sparse features are used in both the ranking and filtering stage and hence can share the same ETs. We employ two different ETs: user-item embedding table (UIET) and the item embedding table (ItET). The UIET holds user-item features used by the filtering and ranking stage. Some UIETs are exclusively used by the filtering or the ranking stage while some UIETs are shared by the two stages. The item characteristics are stored in the ItET. To conserve memory space, the ItET can be accessed by both the filtering and the ranking stage.\nFor the UIETs, ET lookups and pooling operations are done in the filtering and ranking stage, respectively. For the ItET, two primary operations are required: (i) lookups and pooling on the ET to transform a sparse input feature into a dense vector; (ii) the NNS on the ET to return the candidate item IDs in the filtering stage. The iMARS architecture implements the two types of ETs inside its IMC fabric. CMAs integrate reads, searches, and in-memory logic/arithmetic operations in a single array, which makes them a suitable choice for implementing UIETs and ItETs.\nWhile the circuits inside a CMA are described in [9], we introduce the design of a novel, two-level hierarchy based on CMAs and adder trees to store and efficiently compute on the large number of items in the ETs as needed by the RecSys. The components that implement ETs inside iMARS (i.e., the CMAs and adder trees) are discussed below.\nHierarchical CMAs: To accomodate the large ETs, B banks of CMAs are deployed in iMARS. Fig. 3(b) depicts the structure of one CMA bank, which consists of M mats (labeled as Mat-1, Mat-2, ..., Mat-M ). Each mat is comprised of C CMAs that work independently as the IMC engines in iMARS for performing lookups, searches and additions. An individual CMA is depicted in Fig. 3(c). It employs CAM sense amplifiers (SAs) based on a preset threshold, as well as searchline (SL) drivers and priority encoders to perform threshold based NNS. We chose to implement threshold based matching in the CAM based on a reference current generated by a dummy 1T+1FeFET cell, which can be adjusted to compensate for process variations or to change the sensitivity of the Hamming distance in the NNS operation. The RAM SAs, wordline (WL) and bitline (BL) drivers are used during lookups. Pooling operations are performed with in-memory additions (through an accumulator placed next to the RAM SA). More details on the CMA structure can be found in [9]. FeFET-based CMAs [9] are utilized to implement the ETs. When compared to CMOS-based counterparts, FeFET-based CMAs have higher density (which helps to reduce the area footprint) and lower leakage power [8].\nAdder trees: To support the accumulation of a large number of parameters, we develop a hierarchical, adder tree structure. Specifically, iMARS uses in-memory addition to sum, in a single memory array, embeddings comprised of 32 dimensions with int-8 quantization. To accumulate (sum up) the outputs of the CMAs for each mat, iMARS sums up C 256-bit (i.e., 32×8)-bit numbers leveraging a near-memory, 256-bit intramat adder tree placed in each mat. Different mats can perform intra-mat additions in parallel.
