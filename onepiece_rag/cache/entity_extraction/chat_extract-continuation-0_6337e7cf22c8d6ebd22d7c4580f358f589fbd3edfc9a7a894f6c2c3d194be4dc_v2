A Proof of Proposition 1.2 </p><h2>text</h2> <p>Notice that (74) can be obtained from (73) by setting ℓ = 0. Thus, in the discussion given below, we will establish (73) for each ℓ = 0, 1, . . . under p e n = Ω(1), and show that this extra condition is not needed if ℓ = 0.\nWe start by finding an upper bound on the left hand side (L.H.S.) of (73). Given the definition of X u in (68), we obtain\nP [A h ∩ X u ] ≤ P [A h ∩ (|S xy | = u)] .\nThen, we have\nℓ h=0 Kn u=1 P [A h ∩ X u ] ≤ ℓ h=0 Kn u=1 P [A h ∩ (|S xy | = u)] = Kn u=1 P[|S xy | = u] • ℓ h=0 P [A h | (|S xy | = u)] . (87)\nTo compute the R.H.S. of (87), we first use Lemma 10 to get\nP[|S xy | = u] ≤ 1 u! K 2 n P n -K n u .(88)\nNext, we compute\nP [A h | (|S xy | = u)]\n. Given (63), we let m 1 = h and m 2 = m 3 = ℓh in Lemma 4 and obtain\nP [A h | (|S xy | = u)] ∼ n 2ℓ-h h![(ℓ -h)!] 2 • e -2pen+ pepnu Kn n × P[E xj∩yj | (|S xy | = u)] h × P[E xj∩yj | (|S xy | = u)] ℓ-h × P[E xj∩yj | (|S xy | = u)] ℓ-h . (89\n)\nFrom E xj = C xj ∩ K xj and E yj = C yj ∩ K yj , it is clear that E xj and E yj are independent of (|S xy | = u). This leads\nP[E xj∩yj | (|S xy | = u)] ≤ P[E xj | (|S xy | = u)] = p e (90) P[E xj∩yj | (|S xy | = u)] ≤ P[E xj | (|S xy | = u)] = p e (91) P[E xj∩yj | (|S xy | = u)] ≤ P[E yj | (|S xy | = u)] = p e . (92)\nApplying (90), ( 91) and ( 92) to (89), we obtain\nP [A h | (|S xy | = u)] ≤ 2n 2ℓ-h • e -2pen+ pepnnu Kn • (p e ) 2ℓ-h = 2e -2pen+ pepn nu Kn (p e n) 2ℓ-h (93)\nfor all n sufficiently large.\nApplying (93) to (87), we derive for all n sufficiently large From ( 72) and (97), we have R.H.S. of (94)\n= ℓ h=0 P A h ∩ K xy • O((ℓ!) 2 ) • Kn u=1 K 2 n P n -K n • e pnpen Kn u .

Now we prove (99). Given p e = ln n+(k-1) ln ln n+αn n with lim n→∞ α n = -∞ we have p e ≤ 3 2 • ln n n for all sufficiently large n. Recalling also that K n ≥ 2, we get . We now obtain\nK 2 n P n -K n ∼ K 2 n P n ∼ p s .\nThen,\nK 2 n\nPn-Kn ≤ 2p s for all n sufficiently large. Hence, on the same range, we see from (101) that\nK 2 n P n -K n • e pn Kn •pen ≤ 2p s • e 3 4 pn ln n . (102\n)\nIn order to evaluate the R.H.S. of (102), we define\nF (n) = 2p s • e 3 4 pn ln n .
