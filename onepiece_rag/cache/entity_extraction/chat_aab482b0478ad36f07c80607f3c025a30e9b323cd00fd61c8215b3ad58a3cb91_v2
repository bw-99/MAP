For example, random sampling of linear extensions has an expected running time of O(n 3 log n) [Huber, 2006]. Below we show that sorting by k-Pareto optimality offers an efficient alternative.\nThe basic algorithm for the k-Pareto optimality based sorting is straightforward. In the case of an arbitrary relation R, po(x) is computed by summing up the measures of the items that are strictly preferable to x. This requires one pass through the whole set X for every element x ∈ X with computation complexity O(n 2 ). The complexity of sorting X by increasing values of po is O(n log n). Therefore, the total computational complexity is O(n 2 ).\nThe case of composite relations defined on the probability space allows constructing even faster sorting procedures. We illustrate this idea for R = R l &R p &R r from our housings example. We define the component relations as follows: for i ∈ {l, r, p}, aR i b iff X i (a) ≤ X i (b), where the real valued random variable X l represents proximity to the location, X p represents population size, and X r (x) is 0 when x is close to a river and 1 otherwise. For independent X i , we have: po(x) = P ({y|yR * x}), = P ({y|yRx}) -P ({y|yRx and xRy}), = i∈{1,...,m}\nP (X i ≤ x i ) - i∈{1,...,m} P (X i = x i ).\nThe cumulative probability distributions F i (x) = P (X i ≤ x) can be approximated by the respective empirical cumulative probability distributions Fi (x). The computation complexity of estimating Fi is O(n log n). This needs to be done for every component relation R i , resulting in the total complexity of O(n log n). </p><h2>publication_ref</h2> <p>[] </p><h2>figure_ref</h2> <p>[] </p><h2>table_ref</h2> <p>[] </p><h2>heading</h2> <p>Application to Genetic Optimization </p><h2>text</h2> <p>In Section 1, we hypothesized that sorting with choice maximization can be beneficial for genetic optimization. Indeed, this strategy results in the maximization of the population diversity and allows exploring the search space more efficiently. Additionally, Pareto dominance-based many-objective 12 genetic optimiza-tion algorithms are known to suffer from the lack of selection pressure [Palakonda et al., 2018]. When the number of objectives increases, the number of incomparable solutions grows exponentially. However, as shown in Section 4.2, sorting random independent vectors by their Pareto optimality can be considered as a liner extension of the defined preference relation. The fact that P (po(x) = po(y)) = 0 means that such sorting rarely produces ties and for any two solutions either x is preferable to y or vice versa. In the rest of this subsection, we demonstrate that the proposed approach indeed improves the performance of genetic algorithms in the case of independent objectives.\nTo evaluate the proposed sorting procedure, we use it in NSGA-II instead of Pareto dominance-based sorting. We experiment with two measures µ: counting and probability measures. This gives us two versions of genetic algorithms referred to as PO-count and PO-prob respectively. These algorithms are compared with implementations of the state-of-the-art algorithms NSGA-II and NSGA-III [Deb and Jain, 2013] from the deap python library 13 . For the experimental evaluation, we use the 0/1 knapsack problem with independent objectives as defined in [Zitzler and Thiele, 1999]. The number of knapsacks (objectives) is varied within the following set n k ∈ {2 -8, 10, 15, 25} and the number of items is set to 250. We adopt random selection with replacement and uniform crossover with mutation probability 0.01. We set the population size to 250 and the number of generations to 500. All results are the average among 30 independent runs.\nBelow we analyze the performance of different algorithms in terms of the classical hypervolume metric [Shang et al., 2020] with the origin of coordinates as a reference point. In our setup, this metric is to be maximized. We choose NSGA-II as the baseline, and present the relative changes in the hypervolume indicator for the rest of the algorithms in Fig. 7 (increase: positive number, decrease: negative number). We notice that despite having been developed for the manyobjective optimization, NSGA-III almost always results in lower values of hypervolume, even for a large number of knapsacks. This confirms a similar observation from [Ishibuchi et al., 2016], and supports our choice of NSGA-II as a baseline for implementation and comparison instead of NSGA-III. Further, we see that the value of relative increase for PO-count is always very close to 0. It means that PO-count yields a population covering the same hypervolume as NSGA-II. Contrarily, PO-prob improves the hypervolume, as compared to NSGA-II. This difference is visible for small n k (+4% for n k = 2) and is especially prominent for large n k (+60% for n k = 25).
