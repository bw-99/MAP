Implementation details. We closely follow the parameter settings as HGCN [11], fix the number of embedding dimensions to 16 and then perform hyper-parameter search on a validation set over learning rate, weight decay, dropout, and the number of layers. We also adopt the early stopping strategies based on the validation set as [11]. For baselines, we mainly refer to the reported results in the literature, and for the inconsistent cases (such as different embedding dimensions in H2H-GCN), we re-implement their official code in similar experimental settings. Evaluation metric. Following the literature, we report the F1-score for Disease and Airport datasets, and accuracy for the others in the node classification tasks. For the link predictions task, the Area Under Curve (AUC) is calculated. <h2>publication_ref</h2>['b55', 'b34', 'b27', 'b77', 'b82', 'b92', 'b10', 'b44', 'b95', 'b96', 'b10', 'b10', 'b10']<h2>figure_ref</h2>[]<h2>table_ref</h2>['tab_2']<h2>heading</h2>Experimental Results<h2>text</h2>We report the results of 10 random experiments 4 , including standard deviations in TABLE 3 and4, where the Δ 𝐸 , Δ 𝜅 , Δ 𝐻 is the improvement of the proposed model 𝜅HGCN over the Euclidean GNNs, Curvature-related GNNs and Hyperbolic GNNs, respectively.\nNode Classification. The experimental results of node classification are summarized in TABLE 3, where a lower hyperbolicity value corresponds to a more tree-like structure. The key findings are: (1) Overall, the proposed model performs impressively, surpassing previous models on four out of five datasets. Specifically, hyperbolic models (e.g., HGCN, LGCN) perform substantially better on the more hyperbolic dataset (e.g., Disease) than on the less hyperbolic dataset; Euclidean models (e.g., GCN, GAT) find more success on the less hyperbolic datasets (e.g., Cora) than on the more hyperbolic dataset; whereas our model performs better on both datasets, which is consistent with our motivation, namely, that the graph can be better learned under the guidance of curvature. In addition, from the improvements of Δ 𝜅 , we discovered that CurvGN with discrete curvature and 𝜅GCN with continuous curvature both perform worse than our method which validates the power of hyperbolic geometry and the curvature-aware learning. (3) When it comes to Cora, both hyperbolic models and the proposed 𝜅HGCN fail to outperform Euclidean GAT [78], indicating Euclidean geometry is more suitable for modeling data with scarcely hierarchical structures. Nevertheless, it is noted that 𝜅HGCN still outperforms well-known Euclidean GCN models, e.g., GCN [35], SGC [83], SAGE [28]. It is observed that the proposed method 𝜅HGCN also helps to narrow down the gap between hyperbolic models and Euclidean GAT.\nLink Prediction. The experimental results of link prediction tasks are summarized in TABLE 4. In the link prediction task, we further have the following observations: (1) Compared with Euclidean 4 The results on Lorentz model are similar. counterparts, Our proposed 𝜅HGCN, and other hyperbolic models have achieved better performance. It is because hyperbolic space owns a larger embedding space, where the structural dependencies could be well preserved by the link prediction loss, providing more space or boundary for nodes to be well arranged; (2) In comparison with the advanced hyperbolic models, our model also obtains remarkable gains and refresh the records. According to the above extensive experiments, we are safe to conclude that equipping ORC with hyperbolic geometry further improves its generalization ability, obtaining high-quality representations for both tree-like and non-tree-like structured data. This confirms our primary motivation that the curvature carries rich information which is beneficial for graph representation learning in the embedding manifold. Specifically, incorporating the structure information featured by ORC helps the models developed in a continuous manifold with negative curvature to perceive the role of each node, accelerating the learning procedure, and reducing the distortion for graph embedding of less hierarchical networks.<h2>publication_ref</h2>['b0', 'b77', 'b34', 'b82', 'b27', 'b1']<h2>figure_ref</h2>[]<h2>table_ref</h2>['tab_3', 'tab_4', 'tab_3']<h2>heading</h2>Effectiveness of Aggregations<h2>text</h2>In Section 4.1, we introduce two tangential aggregation strategies: the curvature-based approach (denoted as Curv) and the featureaugmented method (denoted as CurvAtt). The performance of  these two aggregation strategies is evaluated and reported in Table 5. Our results show that the feature-augmented approach outperforms the curvature-based one in most cases, which can be attributed to the complex nature of real-world systems and the incongruities between node features and topology. The feature-augmented method offers a more flexible and adaptive way to synthesize information from various sources, thus resulting in improved performance.<h2>publication_ref</h2>[]<h2>figure_ref</h2>[]<h2>table_ref</h2>['tab_5']<h2>heading</h\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}}
