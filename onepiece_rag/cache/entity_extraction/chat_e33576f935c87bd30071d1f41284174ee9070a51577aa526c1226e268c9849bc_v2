Therefore, a value of div(Ω) close to zero indicates X 1 and X 2 are strongly correlated via an increasing function. It leads to the idea that Kendall's τ rank correlation coefficient [Kendall, 1948] and diversity are strongly related concepts.\nLet us consider a sample of n points X = {(x i1 , x i2 ) i∈{1,2,...,n} }. Duplicates almost never occur and the order in which points are drawn has no importance. Therefore, X should be treated like a set. We consider the counting measure # and the relation R define on X. Diversity and choice of X are denoted by div # and cho # .\nKendall's τ correlation coefficient is defined as follows\nτ = # con -# dis n 0 ,\nwhere # con is the number of concordant pairs (pairs that do not offer choice in our terminology), # dis is the number of discordant pairs (pairs that do offer choice), and n 0 is the total number of pairs. As duplicates are discarded and the pairs are not ordered, n 0 = n(n -1)/2.\nFrom the above remarks, we have cho # = 2# dis +n and # con +# dis = n 0 . Combining these equalities, we obtain the following relation\nτ = n 2 + n -2 cho # n 2 -n .\nDividing the numerator and the denominator by n 2 and then neglecting 1 n , we obtains that approximately\nτ ≈ 1 -2 div # .\nThis result means that the theory developed in this paper can be used for constructing non-parametric statistical tests generalizing Kendall's τ rank correlation coefficient and can be used for testing partial correlation. Below, we illustrate this property by building an indicator for distinguishing between wealthy and non-wealthy states.\nA group of states might be considered wealthy if the following two conditions hold.\n1. In the group there is no positive correlation between per capita income and the indicator representing education and health.\n2. If a state belongs to a group of wealthy states, then all states having higher per capita income and better value of education and health indicator, must also belong to that group. Now, we define the set of all wealthy states as the largest group of states that are wealthy. If Kendall's τ is used to compute correlation, and correlation is considered to be positive if div # < 1 2 , then the elements of the above set can be easily identified. Indeed, Corollary 1 says that the set of wealthy states must be a set of at-least k-Pareto optimal states for the relation higher income and better education and health indicator. For the year 2015foot_9 , we took Gross National Income (GNI) per capita at purchasing power parity (PPP) as the income indicator, and the square root of the education and life expectancy as the education and health indicatorfoot_10 . The scatter plot in Fig. 16 shows the resulting division of states into wealthy and non-wealthy. We can observe that the wealthy states are defined as the states with GNI ≥ 20 000$. This seems perfectly plausible.  </p><h2>publication_ref</h2> <p>[] </p><h2>figure_ref</h2> <p>['fig_13'] </p><h2>table_ref</h2> <p>[] </p><h2>heading</h2> <p>C.3 Application to Recommender Systems </p><h2>text</h2> <p>Let us again consider the housing example introduced in Section 2.1. If we aim to provide to the user a full set of possible alternative houses that might fit his preferences, then, according to Theorem 1, sorting available habitations by the increasing value of po is the best strategy. As it was discussed in Section 5.1, in the case of independent components of the underlying composite relations, the computation of po can be simplified by using tools from probability theory. Apart from computational efficience, estimating po in this way has several additional advantages.\n• Such sorting results in fewer ties and a meaningful score. Indeed, sorting items x by increasing values of po(x), is the same as sorting by decreasing values of -log(po(x)). The self-information -log(F i (x)) [Jones, 1979], which is additive, indicates how much a characteristic i is valued. In this case, there is no need to introduce any arbitrary coefficients as it is done when sorting by a weighted mean of the characteristics x i .\n• If the condition of independence holds, then rarer characteristics get valued more. This makes sense from the economic point of view and is intuitively necessary for maximizing choice.\n• If beyond the relation R, there is complete uncertainty about the user's complex needs, tastes and desires, then offering him a selection of maximum choice maximizes the likelihood he finds an appropriate item. </p><h2>publication_ref</h2> <p>[] </p><h2>figure_ref</h2> <p>[] </p><h2>table_ref</h2> <p>[] </p><h2>heading</h2> <p>C.4 Constrained Multi-Objective Genetic Algorithms </p><h2>text</h2> <p> </p><h2>publication_ref</h2> <p>[] </p><h2>figure_ref</h2> <p>[] </p><h2>table_ref</h2> <p>[] </p><h2>heading\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}}
