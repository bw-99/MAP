To study the impact of cpt, we investigate how i-Razor performs with the change of cpt, while fixing other parameters (τ = 0.05, λ = 0.0001). As shown in Figure 4, larger cpt leads to larger value of Params, which is straightforward as more embedding regions and fields would be retained. It can be seen that when cpt is relatively small (cpt ≤ 0.3), AUC is improved with the increase of Params. However, when cpt ≥ 0.4, the performance of the model will decrease significantly. The potential reason is that with more fields and embedding dimensions preserved, the DNN model may require more data to eliminate the side-effect of redundant parameters. Meanwhile, the experimental results indicate that larger λ usually corresponds to less Params, which reflects the effectiveness of L p in controlling the number of parameters. However, when L p dominates the gradient update of the architecture parameters, model performance tends to drop sharply since some useful embedding regions or fields with large cardinality may be incorrectly filtered out. In short, both cpt and λ are crucial hyperparameters in i-Razor, and we empirically find them to be effective and parameter insensitive when taking smaller values. In practical use, the appropriate values can be found by performing a grid search on recommended intervals: cpt ∈ [0, 0.4] and λ ∈ [0, 0.01]. </p><h2>publication_ref</h2> <p>[] </p><h2>figure_ref</h2> <p>['fig_2'] </p><h2>table_ref</h2> <p>[] </p><h2>heading</h2> <p>Candidate Dimension Set Study (RQ4) </p><h2>text</h2> <p>In this subsection, we study how different dimension partitioning schemes for the candidate dimension sets affect model performance.
