Each filter computes the convolution to generate a new feature, c i , from a possible window of words x i:i+h-1 , which can be expressed by\nc i = f (w.x i:i+h-1 + b),(3)\nwhere b is a bias parameter and f (.) is a non-linear activation function such as ReLU. As the window slides from x 1:h to x n-h+1:n , the filter yields a feature map\nc = [c 1 , c 2 , . . . , c n-h+1 ].(4)\nAfter obtaining the feature map, a max-over-time pooling operation is adopted to get the maximum value, max{c}, of each output feature map as illustrated in Step 2.\nNext, we implement Step 3 to encode tags. Since there is no sequence for tags, we leverage fully connected layers to learn their features. For each tag, we first use the fastText trick [11] to get its word representation via merging the embeddings of each word. Here, fastText is a simple text encoding technique where word embeddings are averaged into a single vector. As illustrated in Fig. 4, the embedding of \"machine learning\" would be denoted by a new word vector by adding the word vectors of \"machine\" and \"learning\". We then apply fully connected layers to produce the new features whose dimensions are aligned with the number of feature maps for description encoding. After that, feature fusion is adopted in Step 4 to add the new features of tags generated in Step 3 to the produced features in Step 2. Finally, the new features, v j , integrated with description encoding and tag encoding are input of the constrained GCN model. In order to improve the stability of model training, we adopt batch normalization to normalize the new features.\nSimilarly, for abstract encoding of a paper, we can propose the same methodology to learn the new features as the description encoding of a repository in Step 1 and Step 2. For brevity, we will not describe it in detail.\nConstrained GCN model. Since papers and repositories are in two different platforms, the generated embeddings by the traditional GCN are not in the same space. Thus, we propose a constrained GCN model to constrain the embeddings to the same space. Specifically, it leverages the general GCN as the forward propagation model in Equation (1) and minimizes the distance between the embeddings of some bridge papers and their original repositories as a constraint. We use the cosine similarity to measure the distance. In order to compute the cosine similarity distance for the embeddings, we normalize their embeddings as p i and r j , respectively. Let p ′ i and r ′ i denote the normalized embeddings of the i-th bridge paper and the corresponding original repository, respectively. Then, for each pair of bridge paper and repository, the corresponding constraint could be expressed as:\n1 -p ′ i ⊤ r ′ i ≤ ϵ,(5)\nPaper abstract<h2>publication_ref</h2>['b14', 'b10', 'b0']<h2>figure_ref</h2>[]<h2>table_ref</h2>[]<h2>heading</h2>Repository tags & descriptions Text Encoding<h2>text</h2><h2>publication_ref</h2>[]<h2>figure_ref</h2>[]<h2>table_ref</h2>[]<h2>heading</h2>Text encoding<h2>text</h2>Constrained GCN<h2>publication_ref</h2>[]<h2>figure_ref</h2>[]<h2>table_ref</h2>[]<h2>heading</h2>Hidden Layers GCN Input<h2>text</h2>Embedding Layer Score Ranking  where ϵ is a small error term, such as 0.001.\nIn this paper, we adopt weighted approximate-rank pairwise (WARP) loss [24] to train the paper2repo model in order to recommend the target repositories to a query paper at the top of the ranked candidates. Let L be the WARP loss for the labeled pairs of papers and repositories during training, and m be the number of pairs for bridge papers and their original repositories in the training data. Then, the constrained GCN model is defined as:\nmin L subject to m i=1 (1 -p ′ i ⊤ r ′ i ) ≤ ϵ.(6)\nIn the above (6), the WARP loss function L is defined by:\nL = n k L rank ∆ p ⊤ r + |∆ -p ⊤ r + + p ⊤ r n k | + rank ∆ p ⊤ r + ,(7)\nwhere (0 < ∆ < 1) is the margin hyper-parameter; n k denotes the number of negative examples in a batch during model training; r + and r n k denote the representations of positive and negative repositories, respectively; |t | + is the positive part of t. In addition, L(.) and rank ∆ p ⊤ r + will be introduced below. First, L(.) in ( 7) is a transformation function which transforms the rank into a loss, defined as\nL(K) = K j=1 1 j ,(8)\nwhere K denotes the position of a positive example in the ranked list.\nIn addition, rank ∆ p ⊤ r + is the margin-penalized rank of positive examples, defined as:\nrank ∆ p ⊤ r + = n k I ∆ -p ⊤ r + + p ⊤ r n k > 0 ,(9)\nwhere I (.) is the indicator function that outputs\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}}
