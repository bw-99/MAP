It involves three principal modules: deep recommendation models (consisting of an embedding layer and an MLP component) for predicting user preferences, a Bernoulli gates layer responsible for dimension selection, and a K-means cluster algorithm that partitions the heterogeneous data.\nIn the searching stage, the key objective is to identify the optimal, instance-wise embedding dimensions across different fields, thus facilitating an accurate recommendation prediction. As shown in Figure 1, the categorical field features are directed to an embedding layer to generate embedding representations. These representations are then processed through the Bernoulli gates to produce embedding masks using a stochastic selection mode (see Section 3.3.1). Each embedding mask comprises a binary vector that serves as a gate on whether the corresponding dimension should be incorporated into the downstream architecture. Then the framework conducts an element-wise multiplication between a sample's embedding representations and embedding masks. This resultant masked embedding representation is then directed to the base MLP component to predict user preference.\nIn the clustering stage, the main objective is to utilize K-Means algorithm [28] to cluster samples into groups. This stage mostly mirrors the procedure used in the searching stage: using the embedding layer and Bernoulli gates (but using deterministic selection mode, see Section 3.3.2) to calculate the masked embedding representations. These masked embedding representations are then used to train a mini-batch K-Means cluster [28]. As shown in Figure 1, the K-means separates the red and yellow samples from the blue and green samples.\nThe retraining stage aims to develop cluster-customized DLRMs, considering the variation in dimension patterns across different clusters. In each cluster, we calculate the embedding masks (using deterministic selection mode) for all samples. The resultant masks are then averaged to obtain one vector, which is used to determine the final embedding dimensions of each DLRM. </p><h2>publication_ref</h2> <p>['b27', 'b27'] </p><h2>figure_ref</h2> <p>['fig_0', 'fig_0'] </p><h2>table_ref</h2> <p>[] </p><h2>heading</h2> <p>Deep Learning Recommender Models </p><h2>text</h2> <p>In this subsection, we provide a brief introduction to the basic architecture of the DLRM.

The term |ùëõ| denotes the number of unique values for ùëõ-th categorical field. For instance, a categorical field such as \"gender\" with unique valuesmale, female, and unknown -can be expressed through three-bit vectors [1, 0, 0], [0, 1, 0], and [0, 0, 1], respectively.\nTo process a numerical field feature, we will discretize it through custom-width binning, followed by applying a one-hot operation.\nThen, the operation of the embedding layer can be represented as:\nùíÜ ùëñ,ùëõ = ùíó ùëõ ùíô ùëñ,ùëõ ,\nwhere\nùíó ùëõ ‚àà R ùëë √ó |ùëõ |\nis the embedding table of the ùëõ-th field, ùëë is the predefined embedding dimension (typically consistent across all fields), and ùíÜ ùëñ,ùëõ is the low-dimensional embedding representation.
