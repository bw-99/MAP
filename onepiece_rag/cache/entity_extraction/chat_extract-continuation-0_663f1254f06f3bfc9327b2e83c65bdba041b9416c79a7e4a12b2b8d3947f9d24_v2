Similar to the proof of Theorem 4, we know that setting R k,h -(h -1)T k is maximized when h is set to h * + 1 for any h ≥ h * + 1.\nAs a result, we only have to evaluate the two cases by setting h as h * or h * + 1. One of them is the worst-case response time. The formulation in Eq. (57) simply compares these two response times. </p><h2>publication_ref</h2> <p>['b2', 'b8', 'b2'] </p><h2>figure_ref</h2> <p>[] </p><h2>table_ref</h2> <p>[] </p><h2>heading</h2> <p>Appendix E: Schedulability for Generalized Multi-Frame </p><h2>text</h2> <p>A generalized multi-frame real-time task τ i with m i frames is defined as a task with an array (C i,0 , D i,0 , T i,0 , C i,1 , D i,1 , T i,1 , . . . , C i,mi-1 , D i,mi-1 , T i,mi-1 ) of different execution times, different relative deadlines, and the minimal inter-arrival time of the next frame [8], [46]. The execution time of the j-th job of task τ i is defined as C i,(j mod mi) . If a job of the j-th frame of task τ i is released at time t, the earliest time that task τ i can release the next (j + 1) mod m i frame is at time t + T j . Here, we consider only constrained-deadline cases, in which D i,j ≤ T i,j .\nTakada and Sakamura [46] provide an exact test with exponential-time complexity for such a problem under tasklevel fixed-priority scheduling, in which each task is assigned with one static priority level. For this section, we will focus on such a setting. Specifically, we are interested in analyzing the schedulability of the h-th frame of task τ k under the given task priority ordering. It was shown that the critical instant theorem of periodic task systems by Liu and Layland [39] does not work anymore for generalized multi-frame systems. Fortunately, as shown in Theorem 2 in [46], the critical instant of the h-th frame of task τ k is to release a certain frame of a higher priority task τ i at the same time, and the subsequent frames of task τ i as early as possible. In fact, this problem has been recently proved to be co-NP hard in the strong sense in [45].\nFor completeness, the test with exponential time complexity by Takada and Sakamura [46] will be presented in Lemma 12 by using our notation. We define rbf (i, q, t) as the maximum workload of task τ i released within an interval length t starting from the q-th frame. That is,\nrbf (i, q, t) = θ(i,q,t) j=q C i,(j mod mi) ,(58)\nwhere θ(i, q, t) is the smallest such that j=q T i,(j mod mi) ≥ t. That is, θ(i, q, t) is the last frame released by task τ i before t under the critical instant starting with the q-th frame of task τ i .\nLemma 12. The h-th frame of task τ k in a generalized multiframe task system with constrained deadlines is schedulable by a fixed-priority scheduling on a uniprocessor system if\n∀q i ∈ {0, 1, . . . , m i -1} , ∀i = 1, 2, . . . , k -1 ∃0 < t ≤ D k,h , C k,h + k-1 i=1 rbf (i, q i , t) ≤ t.\nProof: This is a reformulation of the test by Takada and Sakamura [46].\nSince the test in Lemma 12 requires exponential-time complexity, an approximation by using Maximum Interference Function (MIF) was proposed in [46] to provide a sufficient test efficiently. 9 Instead of testing all possible combinations of q i , a simple strategy is to use rbf (i, t) = max mi-1 q=0 rbf (i, q, t) to approximate the test in Lemma 12. This results in a pseudopolynomial-time test. Guan et al. [28] have recently provided proofs to show that such an approximation is with a speed-up factor of 2.\nWe will use a different way to build our analysis by constructing the k-point last-release schedulability test in Definition 2. The idea is very simple. If task τ i starts with its q-th frame, we can find and define t i,q = θ(i,q,D k,h )-1 j=q T i,(j mod mi) as the last release time of task τ i before D k,h . Therefore, for the given D k,h , we are only interested in these m i last release times of task τ i . We need a safe function for estimating their workload. More precisely, we want to find two constants U i,k,h and C i,k,h such that U i,k,h • t i,q ≥ rbf (i, q, t i,q ) and U i,k,h • t i,q + C i,k,h ≥ rbf (i, q, t i,q + ) = rbf (i, q, D k,h ).
