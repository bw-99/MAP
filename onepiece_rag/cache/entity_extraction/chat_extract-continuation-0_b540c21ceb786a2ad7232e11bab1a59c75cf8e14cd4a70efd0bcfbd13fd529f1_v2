For the ranking task, the authors used classical NLP techniques like Tf-Idf (Term frequency-Inverse document frequency), latent semantic indexing, neural networks and logistic regression (LR) with the combination of the first and last methods giving the best performance. In a follow-up work, [12] improved ALI by utilizing a pre-trained BERT [3] language model as the backbone to encode text segments. Our architecture extends this approach by including weighted random sampling in the training process which speeds up the model convergence time and improves the overall performance. Concerning a more granular information extraction approach related to automatic consistency checks of financial disclosures, [8] introduced KPI-Check, a BERT-based system that makes use of a tailored named entity and relation extraction model [7] to automatically detect and validate semantically equivalent key performance indicators in financial reports.\nWhen it comes to the NLP-based analysis of sustainability or Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) reports, different aspects have been researched. [6] and [5] addressed the problem of automatically evaluating the GRI-and ESG 1 -accordance of CSR-reports. Both applied unsupervised text similarity measures building on GloVe (Global Vectors for word representation) embeddings. Similarly, [2] leveraged the language model RoBERTa [9] to predict 1 Environmental, Social and Governance factors. the relevance of sustainability reports according to the sustainable development goals in the USA. Specifically targeted for the banking sector, [11] developed a rule-based named entity recognition approach to estimate an index that displays the level of compliance of the climate-related financial disclosures with the TCFDfoot_0 recommendations. </p><h2>publication_ref</h2> <p>['b15', 'b11', 'b2', 'b7', 'b6', 'b5', 'b4', 'b1', 'b8', 'b10'] </p><h2>figure_ref</h2> <p>[] </p><h2>table_ref</h2> <p>[] </p><h2>heading</h2> <p>METHODOLOGY </p><h2>text</h2> <p>In this section, we formally define the problem of matching text segments within documents to relevant legal requirements before turning to the in-depth analysis of our proposed architecture which is visualized in Figure 2. </p><h2>publication_ref</h2> <p>[] </p><h2>figure_ref</h2> <p>['fig_0'] </p><h2>table_ref</h2> <p>[] </p><h2>heading</h2> <p>Problem Formulation </p><h2>text</h2> <p>Given a sustainability report consisting of 𝑁 distinct text segments S, e.g. paragraphs, titles, tables or diagrams, and a set of 𝑀 regulatory checklist requirements R, our goal is to identify all semantically relevant text segments for each requirement. Since the number of requirements 𝑀 is static, but each document has a different length (number of text segments) 𝑁 , we initially model the described matching task from a segment-to-requirements perspective as a multi-label classification problem. Formally, for every 𝑠 𝑖 ∈ S our recommender model assigns relevance scores to all 𝑟 𝑗 ∈ R.\nHowever, from the users' point of view, the reverse direction of getting relevant segment recommendations for a specific requirement 𝑟 𝑗 (requirement-to-segments perspective) is far more beneficial. This is especially true because a significant amount of text segments within a sustainability report is unrelated to concrete requirements in R. This is why, based on the assigned relevance scores, our model ranks the text segments per requirement in descending order and subsequently recommends the top 𝐾 relevant text blocks to the user. </p><h2>publication_ref</h2> <p>[] </p><h2>figure_ref</h2> <p>[] </p><h2>table_ref</h2> <p>[] </p><h2>heading</h2> <p>Document Parsing </p><h2>text</h2> <p>Before we focus on the actual recommender module, the core component of sustain.AI, we briefly touch upon the non-negligible task of document parsing. The large majority of publicly available sustainability reports are published as PDF documents, an inherently difficult format to convert into a structured machine-readable form like XML or JSON. The latter is particularly true for scanned PDF reports that only contain image information.\nTo solve this issue our system utilizes a custom PDF parser (see Figure 2), that is capable of parsing machine-created as well as scanned PDFs with arbitrarily complex formattings. The parser leverages a refined image segmentation technique by combining the powerful object detection network Faster R-CNN [14] with the density-based clustering algorithm DBSCAN [4]. It is also trained to recognize specific elements of a document, such as footers, headers or pagination. For further details about the parser's functionality, we refer to [1].\nAfter the successful PDF parsing we apply some basic textual preprocessing in the form of removing line break hyphens and filtering out irrelevant text segment types like footer, header and table of contents. Our final set of considered segments S consists of titles, paragraphs, enumerations, tables and diagrams. </p><h2>publication_ref</h2> <p>['b13', '\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>AUTOMATED LIST INSPECTION<|>CONCEPT<|>The Automated List Inspection (ALI) tool is a recommender system that ranks textual elements of financial documents to associated requirements of predefined regulatory frameworks like IFRS and HGB.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>IFRS<|>CONCEPT<|>International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) are a set of accounting standards developed to bring transparency, accountability, and efficiency to financial markets around the world.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>HGB<|>CONCEPT<|>Handelsgesetzbuch (HGB) is the German Commercial Code that governs commercial law in Germany.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>KPI-CHECK<|>CONCEPT<|>KPI-Check is a BERT-based system designed to automatically detect and validate semantically equivalent key performance indicators in financial reports.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BERT<|>CONCEPT<|>BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) is a pre-trained language model used for various natural language processing tasks.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GLOBE<|>CONCEPT<|>GloVe (Global Vectors for Word Representation) is an unsupervised learning algorithm for obtaining vector representations for words.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SUSTAINABILITY REPORT<|>EVENT<|>A sustainability report is a document that provides information about a company's environmental, social, and governance (ESG) performance.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>TCFD<|>CONCEPT<|>The Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) provides a framework for companies to disclose climate-related financial risks and opportunities.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>AUTOMATED LIST INSPECTION<|>IFRS<|>The ALI tool ranks textual elements of financial documents according to the requirements set by IFRS<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>AUTOMATED LIST INSPECTION<|>HGB<|>The ALI tool ranks textual elements of financial documents according to the requirements set by HGB<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>KPI-CHECK<|>BERT<|>KPI-Check utilizes a BERT-based system for detecting and validating key performance indicators<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SUSTAINABILITY REPORT<|>TCFD<|>Sustainability reports often include disclosures that align with TCFD recommendations<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BERT<|>AUTOMATED LIST INSPECTION<|>BERT is used as the backbone for improving the ALI tool's performance<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>GLOBE<|>SUSTAINABILITY REPORT<|>GloVe embeddings are used to evaluate the similarity of text in sustainability reports<|>5)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
