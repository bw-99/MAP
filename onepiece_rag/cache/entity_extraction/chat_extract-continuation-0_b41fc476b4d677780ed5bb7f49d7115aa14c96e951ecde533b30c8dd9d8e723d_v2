Implicit-deadline task systems: For an implicitdeadline sporadic task system τ , suppose that we are interested to test whether task τ k can meet its deadline or not under a fixed-priority scheduling algorithm on a uniprocessor platform. Let |hp(τ k )| be k -1 and the tasks in hp(τ k ) be ordered by\n( T k Ti -1)T i non-decreasingly, i.e., t 1 ≤ t 2 ≤ • • • ≤ t k-1 ≤ t k = T k .\nFor a specific testing point at time t j for a certain j = 1, 2, . . . , k, the function tj Ti C i (to quantify the workload due to the jobs released by a higher-priority task τ i ∈ hp(τ k )) has two cases: 1) if i < j, due to the definition of t i as ( T k Ti -1)T i and t i ≤ t j ≤ T k , we know that tj Ti C i is upper bounded by\nti Ti C i + C i = t i U i + C i ; 2) if i ≥ j, due to the definition of t i as ( T k Ti -1)T i and t j ≤ t i ≤ T k , we know that tj Ti C i is upper bounded by ti Ti C i = t i U i . 2\nBy the above analysis, for a given j = 1, 2, . . . , k, we know that\nC k + k-1 i=1 tj Ti C i ≤ C k + k-1 i=1 t i U i + j-1 i=1 C i .\nTherefore, we know that task τ k is schedulable by the fixedpriority scheduling if there exists j ∈ {1, 2, . . . , k} such that\nC k + k-1 i=1 t i U i + j-1 i=1 C i ≤ t j .\nIn other words, by the specific index rule of the tasks in hp(τ k ) and setting α i = 1 and β i = 1 for every task τ i in hp(τ k ), we reach a concrete example for Definition 2.\nA concrete example is provided here for illustrating Example 1.\nExample 2. Consider that k = 3 and |hp(τ k )| is 2. For the two tasks in hp(τ k ), let C 1 = 2, U 1 = 0.2, T 1 = 10 and C 2 = 4, U 2 = 0.5, T 2 = 8. Suppose that t 3 = D 3 = T 3 = 36. By the transformation in Example 1, we know that t 1 = 30 and t 2 = 32. The last release time ordering π of {τ 1 , τ 2 } follows the index, i.e., π :\n{τ 1 , τ 2 } → {1, 2}. Moreover, α 1 = α 2 = β 1 = β 2 = 1.\nSimilar to Definition 2, we can also define an abstracted worst-case response time analysis as follows: Definition 3. A k-point last-release response time analysis is a safe response time analysis of a fixed-priority scheduling policy under a given last release time ordering π of the k -1 higher-priority tasks by finding the maximum\nt k = C k + k-1 i=1 α i t i U i + k-1 i=1 β i C i ,(3)\nwith 0 ≤ t 1 ≤ t 2 ≤ • • • ≤ t k-1 ≤ t k and C k + k-1 i=1 α i t i U i + j-1 i=1 β i C i > t j ,∀j = 1, 2, . . . , k -1,(4)\nwhere C k > 0, α i > 0, U i > 0, C i ≥ 0, and β i > 0 are dependent upon the setting of the task models and task τ i .\nExample 3. Response-time for constrained-deadline task systems: Suppose that R k is the exact worst-case response 2 Since t i is an integer multiple of T i , the property\nt i T i C i = t i U i holds.\ntime for task τ k and R k ≤ T k under uniprocessor fixed-priority scheduling. That is, by Eq. (1),\nC k + τi∈hp(τ k ) t Ti C i > t for any 0 < t < R k and C k + τi∈hp(τ k ) R k Ti C i = R k .\nSimilar to Example 1, let\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>FIXED-PRIORITY SCHEDULING POLICY<|>CONCEPT<|>A scheduling policy that assigns priorities to tasks and ensures that higher-priority tasks are executed before lower-priority ones in a system with fixed priorities.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SCHEDULABILITY TEST<|>CONCEPT<|>A method used to determine whether a set of tasks can meet their deadlines under a specific scheduling policy.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>TASK MODELS<|>CONCEPT<|>Frameworks that define the characteristics and behaviors of tasks in a scheduling system, including their execution times and release times.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>RESPONSE TIME ANALYSIS<|>CONCEPT<|>An analysis method used to determine the worst-case response time of tasks in a scheduling system, ensuring that tasks meet their deadlines.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>UNIPROCESSOR PLATFORM<|>CONCEPT<|>A computing environment with a single processor where tasks are scheduled and executed sequentially.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>EXAMPLE 1<|>EVENT<|>An illustrative scenario demonstrating the application of a schedulability test for an implicit-deadline task system under fixed-priority scheduling.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>EXAMPLE 2<|>EVENT<|>A specific case study that provides values for tasks in a fixed-priority scheduling scenario to analyze their schedulability.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>EXAMPLE 3<|>EVENT<|>A scenario that illustrates response-time analysis for constrained-deadline task systems under fixed-priority scheduling.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>FIXED-PRIORITY SCHEDULING POLICY<|>SCHEDULABILITY TEST<|>The fixed-priority scheduling policy is evaluated through a schedulability test to determine if tasks can meet their deadlines.<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SCHEDULABILITY TEST<|>TASK MODELS<|>The schedulability test relies on the definitions provided by task models to assess whether tasks can be scheduled successfully.<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>RESPONSE TIME ANALYSIS<|>SCHEDULABILITY TEST<|>Response time analysis is a critical component of the schedulability test, ensuring that tasks meet their deadlines under the scheduling policy.<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>UNIPROCESSOR PLATFORM<|>FIXED-PRIORITY SCHEDULING POLICY<|>The fixed-priority scheduling policy is applied in a uniprocessor platform where tasks are executed sequentially.<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>EXAMPLE 1<|>FIXED-PRIORITY SCHEDULING POLICY<|>Example 1 illustrates the application of the fixed-priority scheduling policy in a specific task system scenario.<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>EXAMPLE 2<|>EXAMPLE 1<|>Example 2 builds upon the concepts introduced in Example 1 by providing specific values for tasks in a fixed-priority scheduling context.<|>4)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>EXAMPLE 3<|>RESPONSE TIME ANALYSIS<|>Example 3 demonstrates the application of response time analysis in the context of constrained-deadline task systems.<|>5)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
