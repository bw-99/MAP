Moreover, with the same argument in the proof of Theorem 9, we know that the resulting schedulability condition is the worst if y is 0 under the assumption\nk-1 i=1 U max i ≤ 1.\nTheorem 13. For a given task τ i and a task mode τ k,h under testing, let U max i = max τi,j ∈hp(τ k,h ) Ci,j Ti,j . Suppose that there are k -1 tasks with higher-priority modes than task mode τ k,h . Let U max k be max{max τ k,j ∈hp(τ k,h ) { C k,j T k,j },\nC k,h\nT k,h }. Suppose that k i=1 U max i ≤ 1. Task τ k,h in a multi-mode task system with implicit deadlines is schedulable by the modelevel RM scheduling algorithm on a uniprocessor system if the following condition holds\nU max k ≤ 1-2 k-1 i=1 U max i +0.5 ( k-1 i=1 U max i ) 2 + ( k-1 i=1 (U max i ) 2 ) , (66) or k-1 i=1 U max i ≤ k -1 k 2 -2 + 2U max k k k -1 ,(67)\nor\nU max k + k-1 i=1 U max i ≤ k-1 k 2 -4 -2k k-1 , if k > 3 1 -(k-1) 2k otherwise.\n(68)\nProof: Due to the RM property, we know that T i,j ≤ T k,h if τ i,j is in hp(τ k,h ). Therefore, C max i ≤ T k,h U max i . We now reach the conditions in Lemmas 3, 4, and 5 with α = 1 and β = 1. The three conditions are directly from these lemmas. Note that the above tests assume implicitly that the tasks in hp(τ k,h ) are already tested to be schedulable under the scheduling policy. Therefore, we have to apply the results in Theorems 12 and 13 by testing all the task modes from the highest priority to the lowest priority. The following theorem provides the utilization bound for testing the whole task set in linear time for mode-level RM scheduling.\nCorollary 5. Suppose that k i=1 U i ≤ 1. A system with k acyclic tasks with utilization U 1 , U 2 , . . . , U k is schedulable by the mode-level RM scheduling algorithm on a uniprocessor system if\nk i=1 U i ≤ k-1 k 2 -4 -2k k-1 , if k > 3 1 -(k-1) 2k otherwise. (69) or 0 ≤ 1 -U k -2 k-1 i=1 U i + 0.5 ( k-1 i=1 U i ) 2 + ( k-1 i=1 U 2 i ) , (70\n)\nwhere task τ k is the task with the minimum utilization among the k tasks.\nProof: This comes with similar arguments in Theorem 13. Adopting the utilization bound in Eq. (69) does not need to consider the ordering of the tasks. However, the quadratic bound in Eq. (70) changes for different settings of U k . Let k i=1 U i be a given constant H 1 and k i=1 U 2 i be H 2 . Then, the quadratic bound in Eq. ( 70) becomes 1 -2H 1 + U k + 0.5H 2 1 + 0.5H 2 -0.5U 2 k . The first order derivative of the quadratic bound with respect to U k is 1 -U k , which implies that the minimum U k leads to the worst condition in the quadratic bound in Eq. (70) under the condition U k ≤ 1.\nThe result in Eq. (69) in Corollary 5 is the same as the utilization bound 2 -√ 2 (when k → ∞) in [1], [31] for such a task model. Our results here are more generic than [1] and can also be easily applied for any (mode-level or task-level) fixed-priority scheduling.<h2>publication_ref</h2>['b7', 'b45', 'b45', 'b38', 'b45', 'b44', 'b45', 'b45', 'b45', 'b27', 'b44', 'b27', 'b43', 'b5', 'b0', 'b30', 'b0']<h2>figure_ref</h2>[]<h2>table_ref</h2>[]<h2>heading</h2>Appendix B: Quadratic Bound for Uniprocessor Constrained-Deadline Tasks<h2>text</h2>To verify the schedulability of a (constrained-deadline) sporadic real-time task τ k under fixed-priority scheduling in\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}}
