Unfortunately, the assumption that test cases are readily available still does not hold in practice [7,27,68]. Therefore, while current test-based APR approaches would be suitable in a test-driven development setting [6], their adoption by practitioners faces a simple reality: developers majoritarily (1) write few tests [27], (2) write tests after the source code [7], and (3) write tests to validate that bugs are indeed fixed and will not reoccur [23].\nAlthough APR bots [79] can come in handy in a continuous integration environment, the reality is that bug reports remain the main source of the stream of bugs that developers struggle to handle daily [5]. Bugs are indeed reported in natural language, where users tentatively describe the execution scenario that was being carried out and the unexpected outcome (e.g., crash stack traces). Such bug reports constitute an essential artifact within a software development cycle and can become an overwhelming concern for maintainers. For example, as early as in 2005, a triager of the Mozilla project was reported in [5, page 363] to have commented that: \"Everyday, almost 300 bugs appear that need triaging. This is far too much for only the Mozilla programmers to handle.\" However, very few studies [9,43] have undertaken to automate patch generation based on bug reports. To the best of our knowledge, Liu et al. [43] proposed the most advanced study in this direction. Unfortunately, their R2Fix approach carries several caveats: as illustrated in Figure 1, it focuses on perfect bug reports [43,  The trailing zero (`\\0') will be written to state [4] which is out of bound.\nlinux/net/mac80211/debugfs_sta.c: -strcpy(state, \"off \"); + strcpy(state, \"off\");\n(a) Linux Kernel Bug Report (b) Patch to Fix the Bug<h2>publication_ref</h2>['b82', 'b11', 'b12', 'b17', 'b18', 'b24', 'b25', 'b31', 'b32', 'b37', 'b44', 'b47', 'b48', 'b51', 'b52', 'b54', 'b61', 'b64', 'b82', 'b83', 'b91', 'b92', 'b15', 'b21', 'b60', 'b82', 'b39', 'b6', 'b26', 'b67', 'b5', 'b26', 'b1', 'b6', 'b22', 'b78', 'b4', 'b8', 'b42', 'b42']<h2>figure_ref</h2>['fig_1']<h2>table_ref</h2>[]<h2>heading</h2>Remove the space character<h2>text</h2>Figure 1. Converting a bug report to a patch. \"-\" denotes a line to be deleted; \"+\" denotes a line to be added; and \" \" is one space character.\ndevelopers forget to check if the array is long enough to hold the content before the assignment; or was the bug caused by more complex reasons? The developers then need to check out the buggy version, modify the buggy code to fix the bug, and generate the patch that can be applied to the shared source code repository. The result of this challenging and time-consuming process by developers for bug 11975 is the patch in Figure 1(b). The patch deletes the line that writes 5 bytes to buffer state (denoted by -strcpy(state, \"off \");), and adds a new line to write only 4 bytes to state (+ strcpy(state, \"off\");), which fixes the overflow bug.\nDevelopers often need to fix more bugs than their time and resources allow [6]. Although developers spend almost half of their time fixing bugs [21], bugs take years to be fixed on average [9], [19].\nTherefore, support to make it easier and faster for developers to fix bugs is in high demand. The capability to automatically generate patches (e.g., Figure 1(b)) from bug reports (e.g., Figure 1(a)) could: (1) save programmers' time and effort in diagnosing bugs and generating patches, allowing developers to fix more bugs or focus on other development tasks; and (2) shorten the bug-fixing time, thus improve software reliability and security.<h2>publication_ref</h2>['b5', 'b20', 'b8', 'b18', 'b0']<h2>figure_ref</h2>['fig_1', 'fig_1', 'fig_1', 'fig_1']<h2>table_ref</h2>[]<h2>heading</h2>A. Ideal Goal Versus Realistic Goal<h2>text</h2>Ideally, we want to automatically generate patches for all bug reports. Realistically, it is impossible. We found that only 16.7-33.5% of bug reports in the Linux kernel, Mozilla, and Apache bug databases are fixed. This is because, many bug reports are invalid, unreproducible, incomplete, etc. Even among bugs that can be fixed, some are too complex to be fixed automatically because they require redesign of the algorithm, addition of new features, etc.  (1) which explicitly include localization information, (2) where the symptom (e.g., buffer overrun) is explicitly indicated by the reporter, and ( 3) which are about one of the following three simple bug types: Buffer overflow, Null Pointer dereference or memory leak.
