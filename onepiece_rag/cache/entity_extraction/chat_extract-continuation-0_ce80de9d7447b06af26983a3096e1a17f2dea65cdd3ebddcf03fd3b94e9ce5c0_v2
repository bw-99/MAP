Selections are represented by downsets. The latter are obtained when topologically sorting X and taking the first n elements, for any n. If Âµ is the counting measure, then po(x) is simply the number of elements that can be reached by following downwards the edges of the corresponding Hasse diagram. An example of such a relation represented by its Hasse diagram is depicted in Fig. 10.    Figure 13: Sorting 500 uniformly distributed points. Points in black belong to the first 10 equivalence classes (fronts). Note, that the total number of equivalence classes is larger for po-based sorting. The latter approach results in fewer ties.\nresults of sorting for uniformly distributed points, we observe that both sorting methods result in hyperbola-like selections, see Fig. 13. This means that sorting by Pareto fronts is more sensitive to the topological structure of the analyzed space, while sorting by po preserves its characteristics. </p><h2>publication_ref</h2> <p>[] </p><h2>figure_ref</h2> <p>['fig_7', 'fig_2', 'fig_2'] </p><h2>table_ref</h2> <p>[] </p><h2>heading</h2> <p>B.2 Further Solutions of the Maximum Choice Problem </p><h2>text</h2> <p> </p><h2>publication_ref</h2> <p>[] </p><h2>figure_ref</h2> <p>[] </p><h2>table_ref</h2> <p>[] </p><h2>heading</h2> <p>Further similar solutions </p><h2>text</h2> <p>It is possible to prove that Theorem 1 also holds for T * k defined with a strict inequality (<) as follows, see Def. 5 for comparison.\nT * k = {x â X| po(x) < k}. In this case, the proof of the fact that T * k is the largest in Lemma 1 requires analysis of inequality (4) instead of inequality (3). However, the proof of the fact that any selection T such that T * k â T â T k offers maximum choice for Âµ(T ) becomes a bit more technical. Moreover, it is possible to prove that T is the largest selection of this kind. Precisely, for any other selection S offering maximum choice for Âµ(T ), S â T for some T such that Âµ(T ) = Âµ(T ) and\nT * k â T â T k . </p><h2>publication_ref</h2> <p>[] </p><h2>figure_ref</h2> <p>[] </p><h2>table_ref</h2> <p>[] </p><h2>heading</h2> <p>Completeness of the Solutions </p><h2>text</h2> <p>In the case condition in Eq. ( 6) holds, and if for any selection S there is a k and there are selections T such that T * k â T â T k and Âµ(T ) = Âµ(S), then those selections T are the only selections offering maximum choice. Therefore, we have a complete list of selections offering maximum choice. This is the case for the typical example of the relation R defined in Section 2.3 and the Lebesgue area measure defined on the unit square [0, 1] 2 . This also holds for any discrete measure with constant non-zero weights, for example, for the counting measure on a finite set with a partial order relation. In the latter case, topologically sorting by increasing values of po and then taking the first n elements results in a set offering maximum choice. </p><h2>publication_ref</h2> <p>[] </p><h2>figure_ref</h2> <p>[] </p><h2>table_ref</h2> <p>[] </p><h2>heading</h2> <p>Existence of Solutions of a Different Nature </p><h2>text</h2> <p>Let us consider again the example in Fig. 3.
