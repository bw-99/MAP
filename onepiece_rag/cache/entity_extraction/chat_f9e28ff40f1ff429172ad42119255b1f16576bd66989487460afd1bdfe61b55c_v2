This result relies on the extra conditions P n = Ω(n) and Kn Pn = o(1) for the one-law and on\nK 2 n Pn = o(1)\nfor the zero-law. Comparing ( 22) and ( 23), we see that our 1-connectivity result for G on is somewhat more fine-grained than Yagan's [37]. This is because, a deviation of α n = ±Ω(ln n) is required to get the zero-one law in the form (22), whereas in our formulation (23), it suffices to have an unbounded deviation; e.g., even α n = ± ln ln • • • ln n will do. Put differently, we cover the case of c = 1 in (22) (i.e., the case when p e ∼ ln n n ) and show that G on could be almost surely connected or not connected, depending on the limit of α n ; in fact, if (22) holds with c > 1, we see from Theorem 1 that G on is not only 1connected but also k-connected for any k = 1, 2, . . .. However, it is worth noting that the additional conditions assumed in [37] are weaker than those we enforce in Theorem 1 for k = 1. </p><h2>publication_ref</h2> <p>['b1', 'b10', 'b11', 'b31', 'b32', 'b38', 'b4', 'b11', 'b32', 'b20', 'b11', 'b37', 'b39', 'b32', 'b32', 'b32', 'b12', 'b8', 'b36', 'b36', 'b21', 'b22', 'b21', 'b36'] </p><h2>figure_ref</h2> <p>[] </p><h2>table_ref</h2> <p>[] </p><h2>heading</h2> <p>E. Numerical Results </p><h2>text</h2> <p>We now present numerical results to check the validity of Theorem 1, particularly in the non-asymptotic regime. In all experiments, we fix the number of nodes at n = 2000 and the size of the key pool at P = 10, 000. For Figure 1, we consider several different probabilities of links being on; specifically, we have p = 0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8, while varying the parameter K from 5 to 23; recall that K stands for the number of keys per node. For Figure 2, we fix p = 0.2 and vary K from 16 to 29. For each parameter pair (K, p), we generate 200 independent samples of the graph G on (n, K, P, p) and count the number of times (out of a possible 200) that the obtained graphs i) have minimum node degree no less than k and ii) are k-connected, for k = 1, 2, . . .. Dividing the counts by 200, we obtain the (empirical) probabilities for the events of interest. In all cases, we observe that G on is k-connected whenever its minimum node degree is no less than k, yielding the same empirical probability for both events. This confirms the asymptotic equivalence of the properties of k-connectivity and the minimum node degree being no less than k in G on as stated in Theorem 1.\nFigure 1 plots the empirical probability of 2-connectivity in G on versus K for different p values, while Figure 2 depicts the empirical probability of k-connectivity in G on versus K for different k. For each curve, we also show the critical threshold of k-connectivity asserted by Theorem 1 (viz. ( 9)) by a vertical dashed line. Namely, the vertical dashed lines stand for the minimum integer value of K that satisfies\np e = p • 1 - P -K K P K > ln n + ln ln n n .(24)\nEven with n = 2000, the threshold behavior in the probability of k-connectivity is evident; it transitions from zero to one with K varying very slightly from a certain value that is close to the analytical prediction obtained from (24). Hence, we conclude that the experimentally observed thresholds of k-connectivity are in good agreement with our theoretical results. </p><h2>publication_ref</h2> <p>['b23'] </p><h2>figure_ref</h2> <p>['fig_0', 'fig_0'] </p><h2>table_ref</h2> <p>[] </p><h2>heading</h2> <p>F.
