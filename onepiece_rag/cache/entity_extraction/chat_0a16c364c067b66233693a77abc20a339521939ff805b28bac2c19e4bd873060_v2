In this application, we apply data from a major stock market consisting of 3,000 stocks during 30 years (1990-2018). The data is collected from both external sources (e.g., open APIs for transaction data) or by internal computations (e.g., financial factors). The underlying technique of our system can be easily extended to support other stock markets.\nIn the second stage of Figure 1, we integrate a sparse regression model to carry out factor selection and return prediction simultaneously. The performance of selected factors and predictive models are visualized in iQUANT . The result of interactive factor investing is evaluated in a standard backtesting view in the final stage.\nThe iQUANT system is a web-based full-stack application. All data are stored in MongoDB. The front-ends use Vue.js and D3.js libraries. The sparse regression model is time-consuming. However, it only takes ∼20 seconds in the back-end to compute a sector (dozen) of stocks and respond to the web browser. All performance is measured in a laptop requesting a four-CPU cloud server. We expect to upgrade the server to further reduce computation time.<h2>publication_ref</h2>[]<h2>figure_ref</h2>['fig_1', 'fig_1']<h2>table_ref</h2>[]<h2>heading</h2>Predictive Analytics<h2>text</h2><h2>publication_ref</h2>[]<h2>figure_ref</h2>[]<h2>table_ref</h2>[]<h2>heading</h2>Sparse Regression Model<h2>text</h2>The interactive factor investing approach takes two steps to make final decisions on portfolio adjustment. First, the collection of financial factors are used to build models on the pool of candidate stocks for investment. Second, traders evaluate the predicted stock returns by the model and decide on the portfolio adjustment. In iQUANT, the second step is achieved by user interactions with the interface to understand the model output, and using existing trading strategies/algorithms (beyond the scope of this paper). In this part, we describe a suite of sparse regression models applied in the first step to jointly recommend factors (i.e. feature selection) and predict stock returns (i.e., model optimization). The sparse regression model is a popularly-used one in industry. Users can replace it with other statistics/machine learning models with similar output format. We include the sparse regression model to demonstrate the workflow of iQUANT.\nConsider the model for a stock ϒ during a time period of Γ = [T + 1, T + L], where L is the length of Γ and any time t ∈ Γ indicates the tth trading day. Γ is further partitioned into N trading \n+ L + 1] compose a matrix X = (x 1 , • • • , x T+L+1 ) where x i = (x i1 , • • • , x iF ) . The modeling of stock ϒ in Γ takes N steps, corresponding to the trading cycles of τ 1 , • • • , τ N ,\nrespectively. Consider the ith trading cycle τ i , a sub-vector of actual stock returns is used as outcomes, denoted by y (i) = (y (i-1)D+2 , • • • , y (i-1)D+T +1 ). A sub-factor-matrix is used as the design matrix (predictors), denoted by X (i) = (x (i-1)D+1 , • • • , x (i-1)D+T ). We fit a sparse regression model:\ny (i) = w (i) X (i) + b (i) + ε (i) (1)\nSubject to the objective function:\nMinimize Lasso NLL = NLL + 1 2 λ [α||w (n) || 1 + (1 -α)||w (n) || 2 2 ]\n(2) where w (i) = (w\n(i) 1 , • • • , w (i) F ) denotes the weight vector of financial factors in the fitted model, b (i) is the bias, ε (i) is the error term, ||•|| 1 (|| • || 2 ) is L 1 (L 2\n) norm of the vector. D is set to 21 (average number of monthly trading days). The best weight vector is computed by minimizing the negative log likelihood (NLL) of a linear regression term plus L 1 and L 2 penalty terms of the weight vector. The penalty terms shrink the weight of unimportant factors to zero. On each trading cycle, the model is applied to predict daily stock returns.\nNote that λ and α in Eq. (2) control the degree of model sparsity and weights between L 1 and L 2 terms. In this work, we provide three choices of modeling: α = 1 (without the L 2 term), the famous Lasso model [Tib96] with a fixed λ ; LassoCV model using 10fold cross-validation to determine λ of the Lasso model The sparse regression model achieves feature selection (L 1 and L 2 penalty terms) and model optimization (regression term) simultaneously. This is extremely helpful to alleviate the overfitting effect in the factor investing case when the number of predictors (F = 56 in our implementation) is comparable to the number of training samples (T = 200). Though we apply a basic linear regression for stock prediction, the sparse models with L 1 and L 2 penalties can be easily extended to support more\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}}
