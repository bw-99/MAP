The jitter problem arises when we consider some flexibility to delay the job arrival for a certain bounded length L i . Such a problem has also been studied in the literature, such as [3], [9].\nWe focus on uniprocessor fixed-priority scheduling here. The busy window concept has also been used for the schedulability analysis of fixed-priority scheduling [3]. For the h-th job of task Ï„ k in the busy window, the finishing time R k,h is the minimum t such that\nhC k + k-1 i=1 t + L i T i C i â‰¤ t.\nThe h-th job of task Ï„ k arrives at time max{(h-1)T k -L k , 0}, and, hence, its response time is\nR k,h -max{(h-1)T k -L k , 0}.\nThe busy window of task Ï„ k finishes on the h-th\njob if R k,h â‰¤ max{hT k -L k , 0}.\nLemma 10. R k,h is upper bounded by finding the maximum\nt k = hC k + k-1 i=1 L i U i + k-1 i=1 t i U i + k-1 i=1 C i ,(54)\namong all possible least release time orderings of the k -1 higher-priority tasks with 0\nâ‰¤ t 1 â‰¤ t 2 â‰¤ â€¢ â€¢ â€¢ â‰¤ t k-1 â‰¤ t k and hC k + k-1 i=1 LiUi + k-1 i=1 tiUi + j-1 i=1\nCi > tj,âˆ€j = 1, 2, . . . , k -1.\n(55)\nProof: Suppose that R k,h is known. Then, the last release of task Ï„ i in the busy window before R k,h is at time\nt i = ( R k,h +Li Ti -1)T i -L i .\nWe can index the k-1 higher-priority tasks by t i non-decreasingly. By the definition of t i , we know that (\nR k,h +Li Ti -1)C i = ti+Li Ti T i U i = t i U i + L i U i .\nThat is, the accumulative workload of task Ï„ i from 0 to t i is exactly L i U i + t i U i . Due to the indexing rule, and the known R k,h we can now conclude the conditions in Eqs. ( 54) and (55).\nHowever, it should be noted that the last release time ordering is actually unknown since R k,h is unknown. Therefore, we have to consider all possible last release time orderings.\nLemma 11. Suppose that k-1 i=1 U i â‰¤ 1. Then, for any h â‰¥ 1 and C k > 0, we have R k,h â‰¤ hC k + k-1 i=1 (C i + L i U i ) - k-1 i=1 U i ( k-1 =i C ) 1 - k-1 i=1 U i , (56\n) where the k -1 higher-priority tasks are ordered in a nonincreasing order of their periods.\nProof: This comes from the above discussions with Î± i = 1, Î² i = 1 in Lemma 10 by applying Lemmas 6 and 7 when\nk-1 i=1 U i < 1. The case when k-1 i=1 U i = 1 has a safe upper bound R k,h = âˆž in Eq. (56). Theorem 10. Suppose that k i=1 U i â‰¤ 1. The worst-case response time of task Ï„ k is at most R k â‰¤ k-1 i=1 (Ci + LiUi) -k-1 i=1 Ui( k-1 =i C ) 1 -k-1 i=1 Ui ,(57)\n+ max h * C k 1 -k-1 i=1 Ui , (h * + 1)C k 1 -k-1 i=1 Ui -h * T k + L k\nwhere the k -1 higher-priority tasks are ordered in a nonincreasing order of their periods and h * = L k T k + 1.\nProof: By the definition of h * , we know that\n(h * -1)T k - L k â‰¤ 0, whereas h * T k -L k > 0. When h â‰¤ h * , we know that max {(h * -1)T k -L k , 0} is 0. Therefore, R k,h -0 is maximized when h is set to h * for any h â‰¤ h * . The first-order derivative of R k,h -((h -1)T k -L k ) with respect to h when h â‰¥ h * + 1 is C k 1-k-1 i=1 Ui -T k = C k -(1-k-1 i=1 Ui)T k 1-k-1 i=1 Ui\n. Similar to the proof of Theorem 4, we know that setting R k,h -(h -1)T k is maximized when h is set to h * + 1 for any h â‰¥ h * + 1.\nAs a result, we only have to evaluate the two cases by setting h as h * or h * + 1. One of them is the worst-case response time. The formulation in Eq.
