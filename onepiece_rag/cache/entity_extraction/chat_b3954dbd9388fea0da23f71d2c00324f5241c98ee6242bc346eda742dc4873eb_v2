This analysis is less precise than the Liu and Layland bound ln 2 ≈ 0.693, a simple implication by using k 2 U. However, if we are allowed to change the execution time and period of a task for different job releases (called acyclic task model in [1]), then the tight utilization bound 2 -√ 2 can be easily achieved by using k 2 Q, detailed in Appendix F.<h2>publication_ref</h2>['b0']<h2>figure_ref</h2>[]<h2>table_ref</h2>[]<h2>heading</h2>Uniprocessor Arbitrary-Deadline Systems<h2>text</h2>For a specified fixed-priority scheduling algorithm, let hp(τ k ) be the set of tasks with higher priority than τ k . We now classify the task set hp(τ k ) into two subsets: <h2>publication_ref</h2>[]<h2>figure_ref</h2>[]<h2>table_ref</h2>[]<h2>heading</h2>TABLE I:<h2>text</h2>The αi and βi parameters in our demonstrated task models.\n• hp 1 (τ k ) consists of the higher-priority tasks with periods smaller than D k . • hp 2 (τ k ) consists of the higher-priority tasks with periods larger than or equal to D k .\nThe exact schedulability analysis for arbitrary-deadline task sets under fixed-priority scheduling has been developed in [34]. The schedulability analysis is to use a busy-window concept to evaluate the worst-case response time. That is, we release all the higher-priority tasks together with task τ k at time 0 and all the subsequent jobs are released as early as possible by respecting to the minimum inter-arrival time. The busy window finishes when a job of task τ k finishes before the next release of a job of task τ k . It has been shown in [34] that the worstcase response time of task τ k can be found in one of the jobs of task τ k in the busy window.\nFor the h-th job of task τ k in the busy window, the finishing time R k,h is the minimum t such that\nhC k + k-1 i=1 t T i C i ≤ t,\nand, hence, its response time is R k,h -(h -1)T k . The busy window of task τ k finishes on the h-th job if R k,h ≤ hT k .\nWe can create a virtual sporadic task τ k with execution time\nC k = D k T k C k + τi∈hp2(τ k ) C i , relative deadline D k = D k ,\nand period T k = D k . For notational brevity, suppose that there are k * -1 tasks in hp 1 (τ k ). We have then the following theorem.\nTheorem 3. Task τ k in a sporadic task system is schedulable by the fixed-priority scheduling algorithm if\nk * -1 i=1 Ci D k ≤ 1 and C k D k ≤ 1- k * -1 i=1 U i - k * -1 i=1 C i D k + k * -1 i=1 U i ( k * -1 =i C ) D k ,(25)\nin which C k = D k T k C k + τi∈hp2(τ k ) C i ,\nand the k * -1 higher-priority tasks in hp 1 (τ k ) are indexed in a nondecreasing order of\nD k Ti -1 T i .\nProof: The analysis is based on the observation to test whether the busy window can finish within interval length D k , which was also adopted in [22] and [20]. By setting t i = D k Ti -1 T i , and indexing the tasks in a non-decreasing order of t i leads to the satisfaction of Definition 2 with α i = 1 and β i = 1.\nAnalyzing the schedulability by using Theorem 3 can be good if D k T k is small. However, as the busy window may be stretched when D k T k is large, we further present how to safely estimate the worst-case response time. Suppose that t j = R k,h Tj -1 T j for a higher-priority task τ j . We index the tasks such that the last release ordering π of the k -1 higher-priority tasks is with t j ≤ t j+1 for j = 1, 2, . . . , k -2. Therefore, we know that R k,h is upper bounded by finding the maximum\nt k = hC k + k-1 i=1 t i U i + k-1 i=1 C i ,(26)\nwith 0 ≤ t 1 ≤ t 2 ≤ • • • ≤ t k-1 ≤ t k and hC k + k-1 i=1 t i U i + j-1 i=1 C i > t j ,∀j = 1, 2, . . . , k -1.(27)\nTherefore, the above derivation of R k,h satisfies Definition 3 with α i = 1, and β i = 1 for any higher-priority task τ i . However, it should be noted that the last release time ordering π is actually unknown since R k,h is unknown. Therefore, we have to apply Lemma 7 for such cases to obtain the worst-case release time ordering, i.e., the k -1 higher-priority tasks are ordered in a non-increasing order of their periods.\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}}
