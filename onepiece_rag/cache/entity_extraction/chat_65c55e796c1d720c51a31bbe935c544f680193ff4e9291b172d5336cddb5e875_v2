In a TCAM array with r rows and c columns, the TCAM cells in a row are serially connected through a common matchline. Each TCAM cell, s ij , performs an XOR operation between bit j of query Q and the bit j stored at s ij . Each matchline implements a logic AND of all the cells connected to it.\nCrossbars are an IMC structure where every input is connected to every output through cross-points that consist of memory elements and selectors. Crossbars can efficiently implement matrix-vector multiplications, and are thus ideal accelerators for DNN models such as convolutional neural networks [14].\nGPCiMs [7], [15] perform general-purpose Boolean logic and arithmetic operations inside RAM. GPCiMs can employ specialized memory cells based on emerging technologies to perform current-based operations inside a memory array (e.g., [7]). Alternatively, customized memory peripherals (such as sense amplifiers) can be designed to operate with two memory words that are simultaneously selected by row decoders. In GPCiMs that employ customized sensed amplifiers, the voltage (or current flow) through a column-connected bitline is sensed and compared to one (or multiple) reference(s) so the results of Boolean logic/arithmetic can be produced.\nCMAs [8], [9], [15] combine multiple IMC functionalities in the same physical structure. For instance, CMAs can work as either TCAM or GPCiM units at distinct times. Note that conventional TCAMs perform row-wise sensing as matchlines are placed along the row direction. GPCiMs, on the other hand, require the voltage drop (or current flow) through the vertically-connected bitlines to be sensed and compared to one (or more) reference(s) in order to produce the results needed for general-purpose computation. Due to this difference in the TCAM and GPCiM arrays, combining them in a single hardware structure requires additional memory peripherals to achieve re-configurability [8], [9].\nStoring RecSys ETs requires significant amount of memory and substantial communication between memory and processing units, which could be alleviated by IMC architectures. The use of CMAs based on emerging technologies can be beneficial for implementing IMC-based RecSys compared to standard CMOS CMAs [15] due to the increased density of memory cells and lower standby power (a result of the device's non-volatility).\nFeFETs have been used in various IMC based circuits such as CAMs, GPCiMs and CMAs [16], [17]. Previous work has demonstrated the benefits of FeFET-based CMAs over other emerging technologies such as ReRAMs [8], [9]. FeFETs have similar structure as metal-oxide-semiconductor fieldeffect transistors (MOSFETs) used in standard CMOS silicon, except a layer of FE oxide is deposited in the transistor's gate stack. Because of this, FeFETs are compatible with the CMOS fabrication process [10] and large-scale FeFET memories have been demonstrated [10]. For these reasons, we employ a FeFET-based CMA design for accelerating RecSys. </p><h2>publication_ref</h2> <p>['b4', 'b13', 'b6', 'b14', 'b6', 'b7', 'b8', 'b14', 'b7', 'b8', 'b14', 'b15', 'b16', 'b7', 'b8', 'b9', 'b9'] </p><h2>figure_ref</h2> <p>[] </p><h2>table_ref</h2> <p>[] </p><h2>heading</h2> <p>III. IMC ACCELERATOR FOR RECOMMENDATION SYSTEMS </p><h2>text</h2> <p>We propose iMARS, an architecture for RecSys that uses an IMC fabric to accelerate the DNN stack and ET related operations in both the filtering and ranking stage of RecSys. The RecSys ranking and filtering stages use sparse and dense features in determining which items to recommend to the user. The dense features are sent to the DNN stack while the sparse features are sent to ETs. For the DNN stack, crossbars can be readily leveraged. For ET related operations, we leverage CMAs and adder trees placed in the memory periphery. Since different ETs play different roles depending on the stage, how to organize these tables inside the IMC fabric must be considered carefully. We elaborate our proposed architecture in Sec. III-A and computation mapping in Sec. III-C. </p><h2>publication_ref</h2> <p>[] </p><h2>figure_ref</h2> <p>[] </p><h2>table_ref</h2> <p>[] </p><h2>heading</h2> <p>A. iMARS Architecture </p><h2>text</h2> <p>The iMARS architecture, shown in Fig. 3(a), consists of two types of IMC arrays: Crossbar arrays for the DNN stack (bottom) and CMA arrays for the ETs (top). The implementation of the DNN and the ETs inside iMARS is described below.\n1) Embedding Tables: Some sparse features are used in both the ranking and filtering stage and hence can share the same ETs. We employ two different ETs: user-item embedding table (UIET) and the item embedding table (ItET). The UIET holds user-item features used by the filtering and ranking stage. Some UIETs are exclusively used by the filtering or the ranking stage while some UIETs are shared by the two stages\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}}
