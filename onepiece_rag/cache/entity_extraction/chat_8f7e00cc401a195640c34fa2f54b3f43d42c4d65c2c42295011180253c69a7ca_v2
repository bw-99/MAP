CellPLM aggregates gene embeddings since gene expressions are bag-of-word features and leverages spatially-resolved transcriptomic (SRT) data in pre-training to facilitate learning cell-cell relations and introduce a Gaussian mixture prior as an additional inductive bias to overcome data limitation Wen et al. (2023).\nThe field has also seen advancements in generative modeling. Compositional Perturbation Autoencoder (CPA) has been developed to learn embeddings for both cell states and perturbations Lotfollahi et al. (2021). This is achieved within a unified framework, utilizing input data comprising two main components: gene expression data and perturbation data, such as drug types and dosages. CPA employs distinct encoder networks for cell states and perturbations, respectively. These encoders map input data into a latent space, from which the decoder network reconstructs the expected cellular response to a specific perturbation. Building on that concept, Lopez et al. (2023) leverages sparse mechanism shift assumption in order to learn disentangled representations with a causal semantic to the analysis of single-cell genomics data with genetic or chemical perturbations. However, in single-cell transcriptomics, such a setting might be overly simplistic. Similarly, SAMS-VAE adopts the idea to disentangle cellular latent spaces into basal and perturbation latent variables Bereket & Karaletsos (2023). Specifically, the proposed method models the latent state of perturbed samples as a combination of a local latent variable capturing sample-specific variation and sparse global variables of latent intervention. These global variables are formulated as the point-wise product between latent perturbation variables and a binary mask. Tejada-Lapuerta et al. ( 2023) argues that disentanglement simplifies the problem of recovering meaningful causal representations assuming independence among latent variables by the use of mean field approximation to ease the computation of variational inference. </p><h2>publication_ref</h2> <p>['b13', 'b15', 'b4', 'b29', 'b17', 'b16', 'b3'] </p><h2>figure_ref</h2> <p>[] </p><h2>table_ref</h2> <p>['tab_0', 'tab_3'] </p><h2>heading</h2> <p>A.2 OPTIMAL TRANSPORT </p><h2>text</h2> <p> </p><h2>publication_ref</h2> <p>[] </p><h2>figure_ref</h2> <p>[] </p><h2>table_ref</h2> <p>[] </p><h2>heading</h2> <p>A.2.1 MONGE'S FORMULATION </p><h2>text</h2> <p>Monge's formulation of the OT problem seeks a mapping T : X → Y that transports a mass distribution µ on a space X to a mass distribution ν on a space Y in the most cost-effective way. The cost of transporting a unit mass from point x ∈ X to point y ∈ Y is given by a cost function c(x, y).\nThe goal is to minimize the total transportation cost:\nmin T X c(x, T (x)) dµ(x)\nsubject to the constraint that T # µ = ν, where T # µ is the pushforward measure of µ by T , ensuring that the mass distribution after transportation is ν. </p><h2>publication_ref</h2> <p>[] </p><h2>figure_ref</h2> <p>[] </p><h2>table_ref</h2> <p>[] </p><h2>heading</h2> <p>A.2.2 KANTOROVICH'S RELAXATION </p><h2>text</h2> <p>Kantorovich's formulation relaxes Monge's problem by considering a probabilistic coupling π in the product space X × Y , which represents a joint distribution of source and target points that respects the marginal distributions µ and ν. The problem is formulated as:\nmin π∈Π(µ,ν) X×Y c(x, y) dπ(x, y)\nwhere Π(µ, ν) is the set of all couplings π with marginals µ on X and ν on Y . This formulation is more flexible than Monge's because it allows for mass splitting, making it possible to find solutions in situations where Monge's problem has none.\nThe Kantorovich problem leads to a dual formulation that expresses the OT cost as:\nsup (f,g)∈Φ X f (x) dµ(x) + Y g(y) dν(y)\nwhere Φ consists of all pairs of functions (f, g) such that f (x)+g(y) ≤ c(x, y) for all (x, y) ∈ X ×Y .\nThe p-Wasserstein distance between µ and ν for p ≥ 1 is derived from Kantorovich's problem with the cost function c(x, y) = ∥x -y∥ p , providing a metric on the space of probability measures:\nW p (µ, ν) = min π∈Π(µ,ν) X×Y ∥x -y∥ p dπ(x, y) 1/p\nThis distance measures the minimal amount of work required to transform the distribution µ into the distribution ν under the given cost function. </p><h2>publication_ref</h2> <p>[] </p><h2>figure_ref</h2> <p>[] </p><h2>table_ref\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}}
