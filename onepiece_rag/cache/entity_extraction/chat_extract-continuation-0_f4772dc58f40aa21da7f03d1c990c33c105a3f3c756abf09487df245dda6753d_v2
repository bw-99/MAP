As a result, the above schedulability condition is the worst when y is 0.\nk-1 i=1 U i ≤ M , we know that C i i =1 U M ≤ C i . Therefore 8 , - 1 M k-1 i=1 C i D k + y + 1 M 2 k-1 i=1 U i ( k-1 =i C D k + y ) = 1 D k + y 1 M - k-1 i=1 C i + k-1 i=1 C i i =1 U M\n(k -1) there is k-1 i=1 a i k-1 =i b = k-1 i=1 b i i =1 a . x z J z -1 J -1 J3 z2 J2 z1 J1 z0 • • • • • • • • • •\nCorollary 4. The capacity augmentation factor and the speedup factor of global DM by using Theorem 9 for a sporadic system with constrained deadlines is 3.\nProof: If k i=1 U i ≤ M or k-1 i=1 Ci D k ≤ M is violated,\nthe capacity augmentation factor is already 1. Therefore, we focus on the case that task τ k does not pass the schedulability condition in Eq. (53). That is,\n∆ max k >1 - 1 M k-1 i=1 U i + C i D k + 1 M 2 k-1 i=1 U i ( k-1 =i C D k ) ≥1 - 1 M k-1 i=1 U i + C i D k .\nThis means that the unschedulability of task τ k under global DM implies that either\n∆ max k > 1 3 , 1 M k-1 i=1 U i > 1 3 , or 1 M k-1 i=1 Ci D k > 1 3\n, by the pigeonhole principle. Therefore, we conclude the factor 3. </p><h2>publication_ref</h2> <p>['b6'] </p><h2>figure_ref</h2> <p>[] </p><h2>table_ref</h2> <p>[] </p><h2>heading</h2> <p>Remarks: </p><h2>text</h2> <p>The utilization bound in Eq. ( 49) is analytically better than the best known utilization-based schedulability test\nk j=1 U j ≤ M 2 (1-U max k )+U max k for global RM by Bertogna et al. [10], since (1-x) 2 ≤ 2 - √ 2 + 2x when 0 ≤ x ≤ 1.\nThe capacity augmentation factor 2.823 in Corollary 3 is weaker than the result 2.668 by Lundberg [41]. However, we would like to point out the incompleteness in the proof in [41]. In the proof of the extreme task set, the argument in Page 150 in [41] concludes that task τ n is more difficult to be schedulable due to the increased interference of task τ n-1 to task τ n after the transformation. The argument was not correctly proved and can be optimistic since the increased interference has to be analyzed in all time points in the analysis window, whereas the analysis in [41] only considers the interference in a specific interval length. Without analyzing the resulting interference in all time points in the analysis window, task τ n after transformation may still have chance to finish earlier due to the potential reduction of the interference at earlier time points.\nThe speed-up factor 3 provided in Corollary 4 is asymptotically the same as the result by Baruah et al. [7]. The speed-up factor 3 in [7] requires a pseudo polynomial-time test, whereas we show that a simple test in Eq. (53) can already yield the speed-up factor 3 in O(k log k) time complexity. We limit our attention here for the global RM/DM scheduling. Andersson et al. [2] propose the RM-US[ς] algorithm, which gives the highest priority to tasks τ i s with U i > ς, and otherwise assigns priorities by using RM. Our analysis here can also be applied for the RM-US[ς] algorithm with some modifications in the proofs by setting ς = 2 3+ √ 7 ≈ 0.3542. </p><h2>publication_ref</h2> <p>['b40', 'b40', 'b40', 'b40', 'b6', 'b6', 'b1'] </p><h2>figure_ref</h2> <p>[] </p><h2>table_ref</h2> <p>[] </p><h2>heading</h2> <p>Appendix D: Response-Time for Periodic Tasks with Jitters </p><h2>text</h2> <p>A periodic task (with jitters) τ i is defined by its period T i , its execution time C i , its relative deadline D i and, its jitter L i .
