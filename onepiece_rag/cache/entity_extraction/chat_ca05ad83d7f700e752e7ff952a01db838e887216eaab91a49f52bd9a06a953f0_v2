Security is expected to be a key challenge in resource constrained sensor networks. A widely accepted solution for securing WSN communications is the random predistribution of cryptographic keys to sensor nodes, and utilization of symmetric-key encryption modes [17], [21], [31] to ensure message secrecy and authenticity. Among various key predistribution algorithms proposed to date, the original scheme by Eschenauer and Gligor (EG) [13] is still the most widely recognized one. According to the EG scheme, each of the n sensors is assigned K n distinct keys that are selected uniformly at random from a key pool of size P n . Two sensors can then securely communicate over an existing communication link if they have at least one key in common; i.e., if they share a common key. This notion of adjacency defines the random key graph, hereafter denoted by G(n, K n , P n ). For generality, K n and P n are assumed to scale with the number of nodes n, with the natural condition 1 ≤ K n ≤ P n always imposed.\nIn this paper, we study connectivity properties of random key graphs in the presence of unreliable links. Unreliability of the edges are captured by independent Bernoulli random variables, rendering each edge of G(n; K n , P n ) to be on (with probability p n ) or off (with probability 1p n ) independently from all other edges. Put differently, we consider an Erdős-Rényi (ER) graph G(n; p n ) [11] on the same set of n vertices, with edges appearing between any pair of vertices independently with probability p n . A random key graph with unreliable links thus corresponds to the intersection of a random key graph and an ER graph. Hereafter, we denote this graph by G on = G(n; K n , p n ) ∩ G(n; p n ); see Section III for precise definitions.\nJust like the random key graph, the G on model can be used in various applications, particularly when links are expected to be unreliable. For example, in a secure WSN application, links might be unreliable due to wireless media of the communication, or due to physical obstacles and altering environmental conditions severally impairing the transmission. We refer the reader to [39] and [41] for two other applications of G on : i) secure connectivity of WSNs under an on-off channel model, and ii) large scale, distributed publish-subscribe services in online social networks, respectively.\nThe main goal of this paper to study k-connectivity of G on . A network (or graph) is said to be k-connected if for each pair of nodes there exist at least k mutually disjoint paths connecting them. An equivalent definition of k-connectivity is that a network is k-connected if the network remains connected despite the failure of any (k -1) nodes [29]; a network is said to be simply connected if it is 1-connected. kconnectivity is a fundamental graph property and is important for various applications of random key graphs. For example, in a WSN application where sensor nodes operate autonomously and physically unprotected, k-connectivity provides communication security against an adversary that is able to compromise up to k -1 links by launching a sensor capture attack [8]; i.e., two sensors can communicate securely as long as at least one of the k disjoint paths connecting them consists of links that are not compromised by the adversary. Also, k-connectivity improves resiliency against network disconnection due to battery depletion, in both normal mode of operation and under battery-depletion attacks [26]. Furthermore, it enables flexible communication-load balancing across multiple paths so that network energy consumption is distributed without penalizing any access path [15].\nOur main contributions are zero-one laws for two related graph properties for G on : i) the minimum node degree being at least k, and ii) k-connectivity. Namely, we present conditions on how to scale the model parameters K n , P n , p n such that these properties hold with probability approaching to one and zero, respectively, as the number of nodes n becomes large. Our main results also imply a zero-one law for k-connectivity in random key graph G(n, K n , P n ) (see Corollary 2), and the established result is shown to improve that given previously by Rybarczyk [32]; see Section IV-D for details. Moreover, for the 1-connectivity of G on , we provide a stronger form of the zero-one law as compared to that given by Yagan [37]; see Section IV-D.\nWe organize the rest of the paper as follows: In Section II, we survey the relevant results from the literature, while in Section III we give a detailed description of the system model G on . The main results of the paper are presented (see Theorem 1) in Section IV, with a detailed discussion and comparisons with the existing results given in Section IV-D; also, in Section IV-E we provide numerical results that confirm Theorem 1. The basic ideas that pave the way in establishing Theorem 1 are given in Section V. Sections VI through VIII are devoted to establishing the zero-law part of Theorem 1, whereas the one-law of Theorem 1 is established in Sections IX through XIII. The paper is concluded in Section XIV, and some of the technical details are given in Appendix A-C.<h2>publication_ref</h2>['b1', 'b4', 'b7', 'b8', 'b12', 'b6', 'b\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}}
