For instance, both LightGCN [12] and NGCF [40] employ a fixed embedding dimension size of 64 to achieve the state-of-the-art performance at the time. However, most of the Transformer-based text and image encoders tend to derive embeddings with a higher dimension number, e.g., 768 of BERT embeddings. To connect the dots from Transformers to GCN, here we propose an item embedding compressor based on Auto-Encoder (AE) [30] to reduce the number of embedding dimensions.\nFormally, given the original image and text embeddings h 𝑣 𝑖 and h 𝑡 𝑖 of an item 𝑖 ∈ I, we can have AEs as:\ne 𝑣 𝑖 = F 𝑣 encoder (h 𝑣 𝑖 ), ĥ𝑣 𝑖 = F 𝑣 decoder (e 𝑣 𝑖 ), e 𝑡 𝑖 = F 𝑡 encoder (h 𝑡 𝑖 ), ĥ𝑡 𝑖 = F 𝑡 decoder (e 𝑡 𝑖 ),(1)\nwhere e 𝑣 𝑖 ∈ R 𝑑 ′ and e 𝑡 𝑖 ∈ R 𝑑 ′ are the dimension reduced image and text embeddings; 𝑑 ′ is the reduced embedding dimension size, which is set to 64 in this work following previous studies [12,40]; F 𝑣 encoder (•) and F 𝑣 decoder (•) as the AE of image embeddings are both two 2-layer multi-layer perceptron (MLP) modules. Similarly, two 2-layer MLP modules F 𝑡 encoder (•) and F 𝑡 decoder (•) are applied for the AE of text embeddings.\nLast but not least, the embedding of the item 𝑖 as the input of graph networks can be derived by concatenating the dimensionreduced item image and text embeddings together as:\ne (0) 𝑖 = concat(e 𝑣 𝑖 , e 𝑡 𝑖 )(2)<h2>publication_ref</h2>['b39', 'b25', 'b11', 'b39', 'b29', 'b11', 'b39']<h2>figure_ref</h2>[]<h2>table_ref</h2>[]<h2>heading</h2>Review-Aware User Modeling (RAUM)<h2>text</h2>To preserve the information from item contents during propagation and to avoid the semantic gap between items and users, we propose utilizing user review features as auxiliary knowledge to overcome this issue. This approach can ultimately assist in modeling users better and help bridge the semantic gap between user and item embeddings via user reviews, leading to a more robust and explainable recommendation.<h2>publication_ref</h2>[]<h2>figure_ref</h2>[]<h2>table_ref</h2>[]<h2>heading</h2>3.3.1<h2>text</h2>User Review Feature Extraction. To consider the sentencelevel and paragraph-level semantics, the Sentence-Transformer [28] is used as an encoder to extract contextualized global semantics from user reviews. For the review 𝑟 𝑢,𝑖 written by a user 𝑢 toward an item 𝑖, we can derive the contextualized representation h 𝑟 𝑢,𝑖 as the review embedding.<h2>publication_ref</h2>['b27']<h2>figure_ref</h2>[]<h2>table_ref</h2>[]<h2>heading</h2>Review Embedding<h2>text</h2>Compressor. As we mentioned in section 3.2, we favor downsizing the embedding dimension for better usage in the training phase. Therefore, here we employ a similar approach to do dimension reduction via an AE. The formula can be defined in this fashion:\ne 𝑟 𝑢,𝑖 = F 𝑟 encoder (h 𝑟 𝑢,𝑖 ), ĥ𝑟 𝑢,𝑖 = F 𝑟 decoder (e 𝑟 𝑢,𝑖 ),(3)\nwhere e 𝑟 𝑢,𝑖 ∈ R 𝑑 ′ is the dimension reduced review embedding; 𝑑 ′ is the reduced embedding dimension size (i.e., 64 in this work); F 𝑟 encoder (•) and F 𝑟 decoder (•) as two 2-layer MLP modules are the AE of review embeddings.<h2>publication_ref</h2>[]<h2>figure_ref</h2>[]<h2>table_ref</h2>[]<h2>heading</h2>Dimension-based<h2>text</h2>Review-Aware User Modeling. In this paper, we assume each dimension of the review embedding represents different perspectives and aspects of the user's feedback on the interacted item.
