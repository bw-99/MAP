As a result, the recommended repositories seem not to be very relevant to the query papers. The need to find a sufficient number of bridge repositories is another limitation. Extensions of this joint embedding framework to domains with no natural analogue to bridge papers/repositories can be a good topic for future investigation. Cold start is one of the most important research topics in recommender systems. As we know, when users release new source code, their repositories have very little user starring in the beginning. Thus, in practice, cold start is an issue similar to lack of sufficient co-starring, discussed above. Our pape2repo is able to partially deal with cold start because, as mentioned in Section 2.3, we construct the repository-repository graph using tags as well. Even if a repository has very few stars, we can still use its tags to construct the repository graph. Therefore, we can still recommend some repositories to the query papers, although the qualify of recommendation will be impacted.\nThe accuracy of our evaluation results is impacted by the accuracy of estimating ground truth. Due to budget constraints, we used three Mechanical Turk graders per item, when they coincided. Grading reliability can be improved by increasing the graders and performing grader training.\nOther limitations include the general applicability of repository recommendations. While software libraries are becoming an increasingly important research enabler, some fields (including theory) are less likely to benefit from this system. The system is also less relevant to research enabled by artifacts not in the public domain. One may also argue that authors will tend to cite relevant repositories as a best practice. This is true, but our recommender system can also uncover subsequently created repositories that impact a given paper, such as novel implementations of relevant libraries, or algorithm implementations on new hardware platforms and accelerators. This is the same reason why one might not exclusively rely on citations in a paper to find other relevant papers, especially if the paper in question is a few years old.<h2>publication_ref</h2>[]<h2>figure_ref</h2>[]<h2>table_ref</h2>['tab_3', 'tab_4']<h2>heading</h2>RELATED WORK<h2>text</h2>This section reviews related work on recommender systems that use deep learning and graph neural networks, especially for crossdomain recommendations.<h2>publication_ref</h2>[]<h2>figure_ref</h2>[]<h2>table_ref</h2>[]<h2>heading</h2>Cross-domain Recommendation<h2>text</h2>In order to deal with data sparsity and cold start issues in recommender systems, recent research proposed cross-domain recommendations [3,9,10,23] to enrich user preferences with auxiliary information from other platforms. Cross-domain recommendations get rich information on items that users prefer buying based on their history on multiple platforms. For example, some users like to purchase furniture on Walmart and buy clothes on Amazon. So we can recommend furniture to the users on Amazon next time, which can improve the diversity of recommendations. Motivated by this observation, a multi-view deep learning model was proposed by Elkahky et al. [3] to jointly learn the users' features from their past preferred items on different domains. Following this work, Lian et al. [13] further developed a CCCFNet model that integrates collaborative filtering and content-based filtering in a unified framework to address the data sparsity problem. However, these algorithms mainly adopt the idea of transfer learning to boost users' preferences via jointly learning users' items on multiple platforms or domains. In addition, Wang et al. [23] proposed a user-item crossdomain framework, NSCR, to recommend items from information domains to users on social media. However, a limitation is that NSCR is a supervised learning algorithm. In contrast, we propose a item-item cross-domain recommendation framework with a distantsupervised learning model (without human labelling for training).<h2>publication_ref</h2>['b2', 'b8', 'b9', 'b22', 'b2', 'b12', 'b22']<h2>figure_ref</h2>[]<h2>table_ref</h2>[]<h2>heading</h2>Recommendation with Graph Neural Networks<h2>text</h2>In recent years, graph neural networks have been widely proposed in recommender systems [1,5,14,22,27,28] because they can encode both node information and graph structure. For instance, Fan et al. [5] developed a new framework, called GraphRec, to jointly capture interactions and opinions in the user-item graph. In addition, Shaohua et al. [4] proposed a meta-path guided heterogeneous Graph Neural Network for intent recommendation on an e-commerce platform. However, these efforts apply graph neural networks to recommender sytems on a single platform. Different from prior work, we propose a novel item-item crossdomain recommendation framework that automatically recommends related repositories on GitHub to a query paper in an academic search system, helping users find their repositories of interest quickly by a joint embeddings across platforms.<h2>publication_ref</h2>['b0', 'b4', 'b13', 'b21', 'b26', 'b27', 'b4', 'b3']<h2>figure_ref</h2>[]<h2>table_ref</h2>[]<h2>heading</h2>CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK<h2>text</h2>This paper developed an item-item cross-platform recommender system, paper2repo that can automatically recommend repositories on GitHub matching a specified paper in the academic search system.
