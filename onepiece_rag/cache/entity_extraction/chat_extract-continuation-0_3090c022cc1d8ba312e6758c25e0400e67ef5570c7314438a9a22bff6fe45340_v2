According to the above extensive experiments, we are safe to conclude that equipping ORC with hyperbolic geometry further improves its generalization ability, obtaining high-quality representations for both tree-like and non-tree-like structured data. This confirms our primary motivation that the curvature carries rich information which is beneficial for graph representation learning in the embedding manifold. Specifically, incorporating the structure information featured by ORC helps the models developed in a continuous manifold with negative curvature to perceive the role of each node, accelerating the learning procedure, and reducing the distortion for graph embedding of less hierarchical networks. </p><h2>publication_ref</h2> <p>['b0', 'b77', 'b34', 'b82', 'b27', 'b1'] </p><h2>figure_ref</h2> <p>[] </p><h2>table_ref</h2> <p>['tab_3', 'tab_4', 'tab_3'] </p><h2>heading</h2> <p>Effectiveness of Aggregations </p><h2>text</h2> <p>In Section 4.1, we introduce two tangential aggregation strategies: the curvature-based approach (denoted as Curv) and the featureaugmented method (denoted as CurvAtt). The performance of  these two aggregation strategies is evaluated and reported in Table 5. Our results show that the feature-augmented approach outperforms the curvature-based one in most cases, which can be attributed to the complex nature of real-world systems and the incongruities between node features and topology. The feature-augmented method offers a more flexible and adaptive way to synthesize information from various sources, thus resulting in improved performance. </p><h2>publication_ref</h2> <p>[] </p><h2>figure_ref</h2> <p>[] </p><h2>table_ref</h2> <p>['tab_5'] </p><h2>heading</h2> <p>Effectiveness of ùúÖHC </p><h2>text</h2> <p>Figure 5 displays the results of adding ùúÖHC or not on ùúÖHGCN. As it observed, the performance degenerates substantially on DISEASE when applying ùúÖHC, while there are significant improvements on the three citation networks, i.e., PubMed, and Cora. This phenomenon can be understood as follows. Adding ùúÖHC as in node classification will force linked nodes to obtain more similar representations. For the pure tree-like dataset, i.e., DISEASE (without any triangle and circle), these node pairs belong to different levels, and adding ùúÖHC impairs the learning of asymmetric dependencies, which further affects the establishment of hierarchical awareness. When it comes to the citation networks instead, ùúÖHC helps to reduce the distortion caused by hyperbolic geometry and thus boost the learning. </p><h2>publication_ref</h2> <p>[] </p><h2>figure_ref</h2> <p>['fig_3'] </p><h2>table_ref</h2> <p>[] </p><h2>heading</h2> <p>Case Study of Ricci Curvature Weights </p><h2>text</h2> <p>In this section, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our method through a case study. We extract a subtree centered on a randomly sampled node (node 10, in this case), from the Disease dataset, where node 2 is from a higher level and the remaining nodes (42,43,44,45) belong to a lower level. The edges depict disease propagation paths. As shown in the upper sub-figures of Figure 6, we display the corresponding edge weights assigned by both ùúÖHGCN and HGCN during the node classification task. The comparison between the two reveals that ùúÖHGCN (upper right) effectively distinguishes node levels, as it assigns greater importance to the parent node (node 2) and equally emphasizes the child nodes from the same level, whereas HGCN (upper left) fails to make such distinctions. This substantiates the importance of ORC in facilitating hierarchical learning.\nFurthermore, we illustrate a subgraph with triangles selected from the citation network, Cora, as depicted in the lower two sub-figures of Figure 6. This subgraph comprises nodes ùëú, ùëí, ùëë that form a triangle. We examine the edge weights around node ùëú and present the results in the lower two sub-figures of Figure 6. Observing these results, it is evident that ùúÖHGCN (as shown in the lower right) effectively identifies the local triangle structure and assigns larger weights to promote inter-node message exchange. In contrast, HGCN (as depicted in the lower left) fails to grasp the intricate topology in this area. These observations further attest to the efficacy of our proposed method in uncovering local clusters and mitigating the distortions imposed by hyperbolic geometry. </p><h2>publication_ref</h2> <p>['b41', 'b42', 'b43', 'b44'] </p><h2>figure_ref</h2> <p>['fig_4', 'fig_4', 'fig_4'] </p><h2>table_ref</h2> <p>[] </p><h2>heading</h2> <p>CONCLUSION </p><h2>text</h2> <p>For\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>ORC<|>concept<|>Optimal Transport Cost (ORC) is a method that enhances graph representation learning by incorporating hyperbolic geometry, improving generalization ability and representation quality for structured data.)\n(\"entity\"<|>HYPERBOLIC GEOMETRY<|>concept<|>Hyperbolic geometry is a non-Euclidean geometry that allows for the modeling of complex structures, beneficial for graph representation learning.)\n(\"entity\"<|>GRAPH REPRESENTATION LEARNING<|>concept<|>Graph representation learning is a technique used to learn embeddings of graph nodes, capturing their structural information and relationships.)\n(\"entity\"<|>CURVATURE<|>concept<|>Curvature refers to the geometric property that describes how a curve deviates from being flat, which carries information useful for learning in graph embeddings.)\n(\"entity\"<|>NODE<|>concept<|>A node is a fundamental unit in a graph representing an entity or object, which can influence and be influenced by other nodes.)\n(\"entity\"<|>AGGREGATION STRATEGIES<|>concept<|>Aggregation strategies are methods used to combine information from multiple sources or nodes to improve performance in learning tasks.)\n(\"entity\"<|>CURV<|>concept<|>Curv is a curvature-based aggregation strategy used to enhance the performance of graph representation learning.)\n(\"entity\"<|>CURVATT<|>concept<|>CurvAtt is a feature-augmented aggregation strategy that synthesizes information from various sources for improved performance in graph learning.)\n(\"entity\"<|>DISEASE DATASET<|>concept<|>The Disease dataset is a specific dataset used for evaluating node classification tasks in graph representation learning.)\n(\"entity\"<|>CITATION NETWORKS<|>concept<|>Citation networks are graphs representing relationships between academic papers, where nodes are papers and edges represent citations.)\n(\"entity\"<|>ùúÖHGCN<|>concept<|>ùúÖHGCN is a model that incorporates curvature information to enhance node classification and representation learning in graphs.)\n(\"entity\"<|>HGCN<|>concept<|>HGCN is a baseline model for graph representation learning that does not utilize curvature information.)\n(\"relationship\"<|>ORC<|>HYPERBOLIC GEOMETRY<|>ORC utilizes hyperbolic geometry to improve graph representation learning and generalization ability<|>9)\n(\"relationship\"<|>ORC<|>GRAPH REPRESENTATION LEARNING<|>ORC enhances graph representation learning by incorporating structural information from hyperbolic geometry<|>8)\n(\"relationship\"<|>CURVATURE<|>ORC<|>Curvature is a key component in ORC that provides rich information beneficial for graph representation learning<|>7)\n(\"relationship\"<|>NODE<|>ORC<|>Nodes are fundamental elements in ORC that influence the learning process and representation quality<|>8)\n(\"relationship\"<|>AGGREGATION STRATEGIES<|>GRAPH REPRESENTATION LEARNING<|>Aggregation strategies are employed to improve the performance of graph representation learning<|>7)\n(\"relationship\"<|>CURV<|>AGGREGATION STRATEGIES<|>Curv is one of the aggregation strategies used to enhance graph representation learning<|>6)\n(\"relationship\"<|>CURVATT<|>AGGREGATION STRATEGIES<|>CurvAtt is another aggregation strategy that synthesizes information for better performance in graph learning<|>6)\n(\"relationship\"<|>DISEASE DATASET<|>ùúÖHGCN<|>The Disease dataset is used to evaluate the performance of the ùúÖHGCN model in node classification tasks<|>7)\n(\"relationship\"<|>CITATION NETWORKS<|>ùúÖHGCN<|>ùúÖHGCN is applied to citation networks to improve learning outcomes by reducing distortion from hyperbolic geometry<|>8)\n(\"relationship\"<|>HGCN<|>CITATION NETWORKS<|>HGCN serves as a baseline model for comparison in citation networks<|>5) \n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
