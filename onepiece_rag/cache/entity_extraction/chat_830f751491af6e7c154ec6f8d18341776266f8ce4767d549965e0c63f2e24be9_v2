Recommender systems has a significant research community and studying such systems is part of most modern data science curricula. While there is an abundance of software that implements recommendation algorithms, there is little in terms of supporting recommender system research and education. This paper describes the open-source software recommenderlab which was created with supporting research and education in mind. The package can be directly installed in R or downloaded from https://github.com/mhahsler/recommenderlab.<h1>sections</h1><h2>heading</h2>Introduction<h2>text</h2>Recommender systems apply statistical and knowledge discovery techniques to the problem of making product recommendations based on previously recorded usage data (Sarwar, Karypis, Konstan, and Riedl 2000). Creating such automatically generated personalized recommendations for products including books, songs, TV shows and movies using collaborative filtering have come a long way since Information Lense, the first system using social filtering was created more than 30 years ago (Malone, Grant, Turbak, Brobst, and Cohen 1987). Today, recommender systems are a successful technology used by market leaders in several industries (e.g., by Amazon, Netflix, and Pandora). In retail, such recommendations can improve conversion rates by helping the customer to find products she/he wants to buy faster, promote cross-selling by suggesting additional products and can improve customer loyalty through creating a value-added relationship (Schafer, Konstan, and Riedl 2001).\nEven after 30 years, recommender systems still have a very active research community. It is often not clear which of the many available algorithms is appropriate for a particular application and new approaches are constantly proposed. Many commercially available software applications implement recommender algorithms, however, this paper focuses on software support for recommender systems research which includes rapid prototyping algorithms and thorough evaluation and comparison of algorithms. For this purpose, access to the source code is paramount. Many open-source projects implementing recommender algorithms have been initiated over the years. Table 1 provides links to several popular open source implementations which provide code which can be used by researchers. The extent of (currently available) functionality as well as the target usage of the available software packages vary greatly and many projects have been abandoned over the years. A comprehensive list of package was employed by several researchers to develop and test their own algorithms (e.g., Chen, Chao, and Shah 2013;Buhl, Famulare, Glazier, Harris, McDowell, Waldrip, Barnes, and Gerber 2016;Beel, Breitinger, Langer, Lommatzsch, and Gipp 2016;Lombardi and Vernero 2017).\nPackage recommenderlab focuses on collaborative filtering which is based on the idea that given rating data by many users for many items (e.g., 1 to 5 stars), one can predict a user's rating for an item not known to her or him (see, e.g., Goldberg, Nichols, Oki, and Terry 1992) or create for each user a so called top-N lists of recommended items (see, e.g., Sarwar, Karypis, Konstan, and Riedl 2001;Deshpande and Karypis 2004). The premise is that users who agreed on the rating for some items typically also tend to agree on the rating for other items.\nrecommenderlab provides implementations of many popular algorithms, including the following.\n• User-based collaborative filtering (UBCF) predicts ratings by aggregating the ratings of users who have a similar rating history to the active user (Goldberg et al. 1992;Resnick, Iacovou, Suchak, Bergstrom, and Riedl 1994;Shardanand and Maes 1995).\n• Item-based collaborative filtering (IBCF) uses item-to-item similarity based on user ratings to find items that are similar to the items the active user likes (Kitts, Freed, and Vrieze 2000;Sarwar et al. 2001;Linden, Smith, and York 2003;Deshpande and Karypis 2004).\n• Latent factor models use singular value decomposition (SVD) to estimate missing ratings using methods like SVD with column-mean imputation, Funk SVD or alternating least squares (Hu, Koren, and Volinsky 2008;Koren, Bell, and Volinsky 2009).\n• Association rule-based recommender (AR) uses association rules to find recommended items (Fu, Budzik, and Hammond 2000;Mobasher, Dai, Luo, and Nakagawa 2001;Geyer-Schulz, Hahsler, and Jahn 2002;Lin, Alvarez, and Ruiz 2002;Demiriz 2004).\n• Popular items (POPULAR) is a non-personalized algorithm which recommends to all users the most popular items they have not rated yet.\n• Randomly chosen items (RANDOM) creates random recommendations which can be used as a baseline for recommender algorithm evaluation.\n• Re-recommend liked items (RERECOMMEND) recommends items which the user has rated highly in the past. These recommendations can be useful for items that are typically consumed more than once (e.g., listening to songs or buying groceries).\n• Hybrid recommendations (HybridRecommender) aggregates the recommendations of several algorithms (Çano and Morisio 2017).\nWe will discuss some of these algorithms\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}}
