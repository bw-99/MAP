Inspired by DARTS [17], [43], AutoDim [19] proposes a differentiable search method to analyze the suitability of different candidate embedding dimensions by calculating the attention coefficients of the corresponding operators. After the search, AutoDim assigns to each field the candidate dimension size whose corresponding operator has maximum attention. DNIS [7] eliminates the dependency on predefined candidate dimensions by directly pruning non-informative embedding blocks whose values are less than a given threshold. Although existing dimension search methods work well in the case of a well-selected subset of fields, their effectiveness in the presence of the original set of fields without feature selection remains understudied.\nSimilar to AutoDim, our objective is to automatically search for the optimal embedding dimension configuration on a given set of embedding dimension candidates. We differ from AutoDim: i) We consider dimension search on the original field set and avoid dimension assignment to useless fields by introducing a novel candidate dimension, i.e., dimension 0. After the search is completed, the redundant dimensions and the fields dominated by dimension 0 will be discarded, which means that dimension search and feature selection can be achieved simultaneously. ii) There is overlap between different candidate dimensions in AutoDim, i.e., the larger embedding dimensions cover the smaller ones, whereas the candidate dimensions in i-Razor do not overlap with each other. iii) Unlike AutoDim, which uses the argmax operator for dimension pruning, we propose a flexible pruning algorithm that allows more fine-grained dimension assignment. </p><h2>publication_ref</h2> <p>['b6', 'b17', 'b19', 'b38', 'b17', 'b38', 'b39', 'b40', 'b41', 'b16', 'b42', 'b18', 'b6'] </p><h2>figure_ref</h2> <p>[] </p><h2>table_ref</h2> <p>[] </p><h2>heading</h2> <p>METHODOLOGY </p><h2>text</h2> <p>In this section, we first formulate the feature selection and embedding dimension search problem. Then, we describe the proposed i-Razor, a two-stage end-to-end framework to automatically select important fields and assign adaptive dimensions to the selected fields. </p><h2>publication_ref</h2> <p>[] </p><h2>figure_ref</h2> <p>[] </p><h2>table_ref</h2> <p>[] </p><h2>heading</h2> <p>Problem Formulation </p><h2>text</h2> <p>We assume that the original field set F consists of N fields, whether useful or not. Meanwhile, taking online resources into consideration, we can roughly give the search space of dimension search:\nD = {d 1 , • • • , d K }, where K represents the number of candidate dimensions and d 1 < • • • < d K .\nA solution A to the input configuration optimization problem involves not only filtering a field subset F ⊆ F in favor of the target DNN model, but also specifying the corresponding embedding dimension size for these selected fields. Denoting the configuration of A by C A = {(f i , d fi ) | f i ∈ F}, we can formulate the problem of finding the configuration that maximizes the performance of the target DNN model as follows:\nmin A L (C A , W (A)) ,(1)\nwhere L is a task-specific loss function, W(A) denotes the optimal parameters of the DNN model under configuration A, and d fi specifies the unified dimension size assigned to all features in field f i .\nFinding the optimal solution to the input configuration optimization problem is an NP-Hard problem, with an incredibly huge space (typical size of 2 N K ) to search for. For the purpose of automatically selecting essential features from a noisy feature set while learning proper dimensions simultaneously without loss of generality and model performance, we propose an end-to-end differentiable framework, i-Razor. The overall framework is illustrated in Figure 2, which is made up of two stages: the pretraining stage and the retraining stage. We design the search space and the differentiable architecture for dimension search in the pretraining stage. To be specific, after an embedding layer, we adopt the target DNN structure to get model-consistent field importance evaluation by learning the relative weights of different operators. After that, in the retraining stage, a pruning algorithm is proposed to abandon unnecessary fields and determine the dimensions of the selected fields so that the target model can be retrained with the ultimate configuration. </p><h2>publication_ref</h2> <p>[] </p><h2>figure_ref</h2> <p>['fig_1'] </p><h2>table_ref</h2> <p>[] </p><h2>heading</h2> <p>Pretraining Stage </p><h2>text</h2> <p>The input search problem is actually consistent with hyperparameter optimization [44] in a broad sense, since the decision of the field subset F and the corresponding dimension configuration C A can be regarded as model hyperparameters to be determined before retraining the target model. However, the main difference is that the search space of C A in our problem is much larger than that of conventional hyperparameter optimization problems. </p><h2>publication_ref</h2> <p>['b43'] </p><h2>figure_ref</h2> <p>[] </p><h2>table_ref</h2> <p>[] </p><h2>heading</h2> <p>Search Space </p><h2\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>AUTODIM<|>CONCEPT<|>AutoDim is a method that proposes a differentiable search for optimal embedding dimensions by calculating attention coefficients of operators related to candidate dimensions.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DNIS<|>CONCEPT<|>DNIS is a method that prunes non-informative embedding blocks based on a threshold, eliminating the need for predefined candidate dimensions.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>I-RAZOR<|>CONCEPT<|>i-Razor is a two-stage end-to-end framework designed to automatically select important fields and assign adaptive dimensions to those fields.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DNN<|>CONCEPT<|>DNN refers to Deep Neural Networks, which are models that require optimal configurations of input features and dimensions for performance.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>FEATURE SELECTION<|>CONCEPT<|>Feature selection is the process of identifying and selecting a subset of relevant features for model training.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DIMENSION SEARCH<|>CONCEPT<|>Dimension search involves finding the optimal size for embedding dimensions in machine learning models.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PRETRAINING STAGE<|>EVENT<|>The pretraining stage is part of the i-Razor framework where the search space and differentiable architecture for dimension search are designed.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>RETRAINING STAGE<|>EVENT<|>The retraining stage is the second part of the i-Razor framework where the model is retrained with the selected features and dimensions.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>AUTODIM<|>DNIS<|>Both AutoDim and DNIS are methods related to optimizing embedding dimensions in machine learning models<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>I-RAZOR<|>FEATURE SELECTION<|>i-Razor incorporates feature selection as part of its framework to improve model performance<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>I-RAZOR<|>DIMENSION SEARCH<|>i-Razor focuses on dimension search as a key component of its framework for optimizing model configurations<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PRETRAINING STAGE<|>I-RAZOR<|>The pretraining stage is a critical part of the i-Razor framework where initial configurations are established<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>RETRAINING STAGE<|>I-RAZOR<|>The retraining stage follows the pretraining stage in the i-Razor framework, refining the model based on selected features<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>DNN<|>I-RAZOR<|>i-Razor aims to optimize configurations for DNN models through its feature selection and dimension search processes<|>8)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
