While these models demonstrate successful performance in cell type clustering, phenotype classification, and gene perturbation response prediction, it remains to be seen if a simpler model could achieve comparable or better results, especially with limited data. This is important, as the quantity and quality of single-cell data typically fall short of the standards in textual data used for training LLMs. Single-cell sequencing often suffers from technical artifacts, dropout events, and batch effects. These challenges are compounded in a weakly supervised setting, where the labels of cell states can be noisy, further complicating the analysis. To tackle these challenges, we present sc-OTGM, streamlined with less than 500K parameters, making it approximately 100x more compact than the foundation models, offering an efficient alternative. sc-OTGM is an unsupervised model grounded in the inductive bias that the scRNAseq data can be generated from a combination of the finite multivariate Gaussian distributions. The core function of sc-OTGM is to create a probabilistic latent space utilizing a Gaussian mixture model (GMM) as its prior distribution and distinguish between distinct cell populations by learning their respective marginal probability density functions (PDFs). It uses a Hit-and-Run Markov chain sampler to determine the optimal transport (OT) plan across these PDFs within the GMM framework. We evaluated our model against a CRISPR-mediated perturbation dataset, called CROP-seq, consisting of 57 one-gene perturbations. Our results demonstrate that sc-OTGM is effective in cell state classification, aids in the analysis of differential gene expression, and ranks genes for target identification through a recommender system. It also predicts the effects of single-gene perturbations on downstream gene regulation and generates synthetic scRNA-seq data conditioned on specific cell states. </p><h1>sections</h1><h2>heading</h2> <p>INTRODUCTION </p><h2>text</h2> <p>The molecular mechanisms that drive diseases are complex, often reflected in the high-dimensional profiles of gene expression. Conducting detailed analyses of these gene expression matrices-across various cell types, disease states, and control versus experimental subjects-is essential to understand disease progression and identify targets for potential drug interventions. scRNA-seq technology facilitates the detailed profiling of transcriptomes across a vast range of cells, from thousands to millions, allowing for the exploration of cellular heterogeneity and the understanding of disease pathogenesis at the single-cell level.\nIn recent years, Perturb-seq has emerged as a powerful high-throughput method that combines CRISPR-based genetic perturbation with scRNA-seq Dixit et al. (2016); Adamson et al. (2016). It enables the analysis of how specific gene modulations impact gene expression across numerous individual cells. Within this framework, CRISPRi and CRISPRa allows for targeted downregulation and upregulation of gene expression, respectively, offering insights into gene interactions and regulatory networks at the granularity of single-cells.\nA significant hurdle in this research is that cellular responses to genetic perturbations are highly heterogeneous Elsasser (1984); Rubin (1990). This variability arises from differences in mRNA and protein levels Sonneveld et al. (2020), cell states Kramer et al. (2022), and the microenvironment among single-cells Snijder et al. (2009). Given the heterogeneity of potential perturbations, and the complexity of possible cell states, understanding the inherent data geometries and distributions of distinct cell populations becomes crucial for effective analyses. sc-OTGM employs a GMM to parametrize the marginal PDFs of diverse cell states and states within a reduced subspace. Not all subpopulations are well modeled by Gaussian distributions, and some subpopulations may cover large regions of feature space due to skewed class proportions and need further subdivisions. However, the use of GMM as priors enables the detection of local, high-density regions of phenotype space and effectively incorporates an inductive bias to overcome the limitations of data quantity and quality. This approach aligns with some recent methodologies in single-cell genomics, where Gaussian mixture priors are adopted to address the challenges of noise and data scarcity inherent in scRNA-seq datasets Wen et al. (2023); Xu et al. (2023); Grønbech et al. (2020); Slack et al. (2008).\nWhile mixture modeling is not a new concept in scRNA-seq data analysis, we break new ground from following perspective: First, sc-OTGM effectively learns the OT plan that facilitates the mapping from one cell population to another on the manifold of Gaussian mixtures. To capture the transformation from unperturbed to perturbed cell states, the model employs a Hit-and-Run Markov chain sampler. This sampler guarantees a globally optimal solution to generate samples from the target distribution and offers faster convergence than small-step random walks Smith (1996). Second, modeling the PDF of perturbations allows us to identify perturbed genes and predict changes in the expression of other genes following perturbation.
