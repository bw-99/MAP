Information via Graph Learning<h1>authors</h1>Jyun-Yu Jiang; Ming-Hao Juan; Pu-Jen Cheng<h1>pub_date</h1>2023-08-19<h1>abstract</h1>Nowadays, modern recommender systems usually leverage textual and visual contents as auxiliary information to predict user preference. For textual information, review texts are one of the most popular contents to model user behaviors. Nevertheless, reviews usually lose their shine when it comes to top-N recommender systems because those that solely utilize textual reviews as features struggle to adequately capture the interaction relationships between users and items. For visual one, it is usually modeled with naive convolutional networks and also hard to capture high-order relationships between users and items. Moreover, previous works did not collaboratively use both texts and images in a proper way. In this paper, we propose printf, preference modeling based on user reviews with item images and textual information via graph learning, to address the above challenges. Specifically, the dimensionbased attention mechanism directs relations between user reviews and interacted items, allowing each dimension\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>PRINTF<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Printf is a modern recommender system that models user preferences based on user reviews and item images using graph learning techniques.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>JYUN-YU JIANG<|>PERSON<|>Jyun-Yu Jiang is one of the authors of the paper titled 'Preference Modeling Based on User Reviews with Item Images and Textual Information via Graph Learning'.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MING-HAO JUAN<|>PERSON<|>Ming-Hao Juan is one of the authors of the paper titled 'Preference Modeling Based on User Reviews with Item Images and Textual Information via Graph Learning'.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PU-JEN CHENG<|>PERSON<|>Pu-Jen Cheng is one of the authors of the paper titled 'Preference Modeling Based on User Reviews with Item Images and Textual Information via Graph Learning'.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>2023-08-19<|>EVENT<|>The publication date of the paper 'Preference Modeling Based on User Reviews with Item Images and Textual Information via Graph Learning'.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>JYUN-YU JIANG<|>PRINTF<|>Jyun-Yu Jiang is an author of the paper that describes the Printf recommender system<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MING-HAO JUAN<|>PRINTF<|>Ming-Hao Juan is an author of the paper that describes the Printf recommender system<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PU-JEN CHENG<|>PRINTF<|>Pu-Jen Cheng is an author of the paper that describes the Printf recommender system<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>2023-08-19<|>PRINTF<|>The paper describing Printf was published on this date<|>5)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
