The alignment loss is from our crossmodality feature alignment encoder in CMIM. It has three subobjectives: image-text contrastive loss and masked language modeling in uni-modality encoders, as well as image-text matching applied to the multi-modal encoder.\n• Image-text Contrastive Learning Loss. Image-text contrastive learning is applied to the uni-modality image encoder and text encoder respectively. It aligns image and textual features, and also trains the uni-modality encoders to better understand the semantic meaning of images and texts. Specifically, a learn-able similarity function s is utilized.\ns = 𝑊 𝑖𝑚𝑔 e 𝑖𝑚𝑔 𝑐𝑙𝑠 • 𝑊 𝑡𝑥𝑡 e 𝑡𝑥𝑡 𝑐𝑙𝑠 (10\n)\nwhere 𝑊 𝑖𝑚𝑔 and 𝑊 𝑡𝑥𝑡 denotes the image projection layer and text projection layer as the pretraining phase respectively. For each (image,text) pair, we compute its image-to-text and text-to-image similarity with instances via the Softmax function:\nŷ𝑖2𝑡 (I) = Softmax( s(𝐼,𝑇 ) 𝜋 ), ŷ𝑡2𝑖 (T) = Softmax( s(𝑇 , 𝐼 ) 𝜋 )(11)\nwhere 𝜋 is a trainable parameter for controlling temperature. Therefore, the image-text contrastive loss from each (image,text) can be written as follows:\nL 𝑖𝑡𝑐 = 1 2 * CrossEntropyLoss(𝑦 𝑖2𝑡 (I), ŷ𝑖2𝑡 (I))(12)\n+ 1 2 * CrossEntropyLoss(𝑦 𝑡 2𝑖 (T), ŷ𝑡2𝑖 (T))\nwhere 𝑦 𝑖2𝑡 (I) and 𝑦 𝑡 2𝑖 (T) denote the ground-truth one-hot similarity, where negative pairs have a probability of 0 and the positive pair has a probability of 1, separately. • Masked Language Modeling Loss. Second, following the same pretraining objective in BERT [7], masked language modeling (MLM) is applied to the multi-modal encoder. The model randomly masks out the input text tokens with a probability of 15% and replaces them with [MASK] tokens, and predicts them using both the image and the masked text.\nL 𝑚𝑙𝑚 = CrossEntropyLoss(𝑦 𝑚𝑙𝑚 , ŷ𝑚𝑙𝑚 (I, T masked ))\nwhere 𝑦 𝑚𝑙𝑚 is a one-hot encoded distribution where the groundtruth token has a value of 1. ŷ𝑚𝑙𝑚 (I, T masked ) is the model's predicted probability distribution for a masked token with given the image representation I and the masked token T masked . • Image-Text Matching Loss. Third, image-text matching is employed in the multi-modal encoder, which predicts whether a (image, text) pair is positive or negative, i.e., matched or not matched. The output embedding of the [CLS] token from the multi-modal encoder is treated as the joint representation of the image-text pair, and is passed into a fully-connected network ensuing with Softmax to predict a binary classification problem.\nL 𝑖𝑡𝑚 = CrossEntropyLoss(𝑦 𝑖𝑡𝑚 , ŷ𝑖𝑡𝑚 (I, T)) (14\n)\nwhere the 𝑦 𝑖𝑡𝑚 is a 2d one-hot encoded ground truth, and ŷ𝑖𝑡𝑚 (I, T) represents the prediction output probabilities with the given (image,text) pair.\nTo conclude, the overall alignment loss can be concisely formulated as:\nL Align = L 𝑖𝑡𝑐 + L 𝑚𝑙𝑚 + L 𝑖𝑡𝑚(15)\n3.5.2 Auto-Encoder Loss. In our proposed model, the AEs are used to condense user review embeddings, item image embeddings, and item text embeddings. All of these AEs are applied with mean square error (MSE) loss,\nL AE = MSELoss(e, ê) + 𝜆 * |Θ AE | 2(16)\nwhere e and ê denote original input embeddings and reconstructed embeddings. Note that we also add a regularization term on trainable parameters Θ AE in the AE with the 𝐿 2 regularization coefficient 𝜆. We have 𝜆 𝑢𝑟 , 𝜆 𝑖𝑖 , 𝜆 𝑖𝑡 of three embedding compressors for user review\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}}
