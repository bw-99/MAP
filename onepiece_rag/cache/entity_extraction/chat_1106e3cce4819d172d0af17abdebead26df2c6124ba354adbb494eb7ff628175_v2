However, it should be noted that the last release time ordering π is actually unknown since R k,h is unknown. Therefore, we have to apply Lemma 7 for such cases to obtain the worst-case release time ordering, i.e., the k -1 higher-priority tasks are ordered in a non-increasing order of their periods.\nLemma 8. Suppose that\nk-1 i=1 U i ≤ 1.\nThen, for any h ≥ 1 and C k > 0, we have\nR k,h ≤ hC k + k-1 i=1 C i - k-1 i=1 U i ( k-1 =i C ) 1 - k-1 i=1 U i , (28\n)\nwhere the k -1 higher-priority tasks are ordered in a nonincreasing order of their periods.\nProof: This comes from the above discussions with α i = 1, β i = 1 by applying Lemmas 6 and 7 when\nk-1 i=1 U i < 1. The case when k-1 i=1 U i = 1 has a safe upper bound R k,h = ∞ in Eq. (28). Theorem 4. Suppose that k i=1 U i ≤ 1. The worst-case response time of task τ k is at most R k ≤ C k + k-1 i=1 C i - k-1 i=1 U i ( k-1 =i C ) 1 - k-1 i=1 U i , (29\n)\nwhere the k -1 higher-priority tasks are ordered in a nonincreasing order of their periods.\nProof: This can be proved by showing that R k,h -(h -1)T k is maximized when h is 1, where R k,h is derived by using Lemma 8. The first-order derivative of R k,h -(h -1)T k with respect to h is\nC k 1-k-1 i=1 Ui -T k = C k -(1-k-1 i=1 Ui)T k 1-k-1 i=1 Ui\n. There are two cases:\nCase 1: If k i=1 U i < 1, then C k -(1-k-1 i=1 Ui)T k 1-k-1 i=1 Ui < C k -U k T k 1-k-1 i=1 Ui = 0. Therefore, R k,h -(h -1)\nT k is a decreasing function of h. Therefore, the response time is maximized when h is 1.\nCase 2: If k i=1 U i = 1, then we know that C k -(1-k-1 i=1 Ui)T k 1-k-1 i=1 Ui = 0. Therefore, R k,h -(h -1)T k remains the same regardless of h.\nTherefore, for both cases, the worst-case response time of task τ k can be safely bounded by Eq. ( 29). Moreover, since the worst case happens when h = 1, we do not have to check the length of the busy window, and we reach our conclusion.\nCorollary 1. Task τ k in a sporadic task system is schedulable by the fixed-priority scheduling algorithm if\nk i=1 U i ≤ 1 and C k D k ≤ 1 - k-1 i=1 U i - k-1 i=1 C i D k + k-1 i=1 U i ( k-1 =i C ) D k ,(30)\nwhere the k -1 higher-priority tasks are ordered in a nonincreasing order of their periods.<h2>publication_ref</h2>['b33', 'b33', 'b21', 'b19']<h2>figure_ref</h2>[]<h2>table_ref</h2>[]<h2>heading</h2>Remarks:<h2>text</h2>The utilization-based worst-case response-time analysis in Theorem 4 is analytically tighter than the best known result, R k ≤\nC k + k-1 i=1 Ci-k-1 i=1 UiCi 1-k-1 i=1 Ui\n, by Bini et al. [14]. Lehoczky [34] also provides the total utilization bound of RM scheduling for arbitrary-deadline systems. The analysis in [34] is based on the Liu and Layland analysis [39]. The resulting utilization bound is a function of ∆ = max τi { Di Ti }. When ∆ is 1, it is an implicit-deadline system. The utilization bound in [34] has a closed-form when ∆ is an integer. However, calculating the utilization bound for non-integer ∆ is done asymptotically for k = ∞ with a complicated analysis.<h2>publication_ref</h2>['b13', 'b33', 'b33', 'b38', 'b33']<h2>figure_ref</h2>[]<h2>table_ref</h2>[]<h2>heading</h2>Multiprocessor Implicit-Deadline Systems<h2>text</h2>We now present how to use k 2 Q to analyze the schedulability for implicit-deadline sporadic task systems under global rate-monotonic (global RM) scheduling.
