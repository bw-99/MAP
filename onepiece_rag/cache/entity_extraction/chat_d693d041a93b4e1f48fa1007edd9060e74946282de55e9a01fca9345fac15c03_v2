Compositional Perturbation Autoencoder (CPA) has been developed to learn embeddings for both cell states and perturbations Lotfollahi et al. (2021). This is achieved within a unified framework, utilizing input data comprising two main components: gene expression data and perturbation data, such as drug types and dosages. CPA employs distinct encoder networks for cell states and perturbations, respectively. These encoders map input data into a latent space, from which the decoder network reconstructs the expected cellular response to a specific perturbation. Building on that concept, Lopez et al. (2023) leverages sparse mechanism shift assumption in order to learn disentangled representations with a causal semantic to the analysis of single-cell genomics data with genetic or chemical perturbations. However, in single-cell transcriptomics, such a setting might be overly simplistic. Similarly, SAMS-VAE adopts the idea to disentangle cellular latent spaces into basal and perturbation latent variables Bereket & Karaletsos (2023). Specifically, the proposed method models the latent state of perturbed samples as a combination of a local latent variable capturing sample-specific variation and sparse global variables of latent intervention. These global variables are formulated as the point-wise product between latent perturbation variables and a binary mask. Tejada-Lapuerta et al. ( 2023) argues that disentanglement simplifies the problem of recovering meaningful causal representations assuming independence among latent variables by the use of mean field approximation to ease the computation of variational inference.<h2>publication_ref</h2>['b13', 'b15', 'b4', 'b29', 'b17', 'b16', 'b3']<h2>figure_ref</h2>[]<h2>table_ref</h2>['tab_0', 'tab_3']<h2>heading</h2>A.2 OPTIMAL TRANSPORT<h2>text</h2><h2>publication_ref</h2>[]<h2>figure_ref</h2>[]<h2>table_ref</h2>[]<h2>heading</h2>A.2.1 MONGE'S FORMULATION<h2>text</h2>Monge's formulation of the OT problem seeks a mapping T : X → Y that transports a mass distribution µ on a space X to a mass distribution ν on a space Y in the most cost-effective way. The cost of transporting a unit mass from point x ∈ X to point y ∈ Y is given by a cost function c(x, y).\nThe goal is to minimize the total transportation cost:\nmin T X c(x, T (x)) dµ(x)\nsubject to the constraint that T # µ = ν, where T # µ is the pushforward measure of µ by T , ensuring that the mass distribution after transportation is ν.<h2>publication_ref</h2>[]<h2>figure_ref</h2>[]<h2>table_ref</h2>[]<h2>heading</h2>A.2.2 KANTOROVICH'S RELAXATION<h2>text</h2>Kantorovich's formulation relaxes Monge's problem by considering a probabilistic coupling π in the product space X × Y , which represents a joint distribution of source and target points that respects the marginal distributions µ and ν. The problem is formulated as:\nmin π∈Π(µ,ν) X×Y c(x, y) dπ(x, y)\nwhere Π(µ, ν) is the set of all couplings π with marginals µ on X and ν on Y . This formulation is more flexible than Monge's because it allows for mass splitting, making it possible to find solutions in situations where Monge's problem has none.\nThe Kantorovich problem leads to a dual formulation that expresses the OT cost as:\nsup (f,g)∈Φ X f (x) dµ(x) + Y g(y) dν(y)\nwhere Φ consists of all pairs of functions (f, g) such that f (x)+g(y) ≤ c(x, y) for all (x, y) ∈ X ×Y .\nThe p-Wasserstein distance between µ and ν for p ≥ 1 is derived from Kantorovich's problem with the cost function c(x, y) = ∥x -y∥ p , providing a metric on the space of probability measures:\nW p (µ, ν) = min π∈Π(µ,ν) X×Y ∥x -y∥ p dπ(x, y) 1/p\nThis distance measures the minimal amount of work required to transform the distribution µ into the distribution ν under the given cost function.<h2>publication_ref</h2>[]<h2>figure_ref</h2>[]<h2>table_ref</h2>[]<h2>heading</h2>A.2.3 REGULARIZED TRANSPORT WITH SINKHORN'S ALGORITHM<h2>text</h2>The Sinkhorn distance introduces an entropic regularization to the OT problem, making it computationally more tractable by allowing the use of efficient algorithms. The entropic regularization term, ϵ KL(π∥µ ⊗ ν), where ϵ is a positive regularization parameter and KL denotes the Kullback-Leibler divergence between π and the product distribution µ ⊗ ν, adds strong convexity to the optimization problem. This convexity ensures that the smoothness of the objective function allows for the application of gradient-based optimization methods that are known to converge quickly.   <h2>publication_ref</h2>[]<h2>figure_ref</h2>[]<h2>table_ref</h2>[]<h2>heading</h2\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}}
