In particular, while teaching for three years a graduate course on Recommender Systems during the Fall Semester (2014-2016) at a Department of Computer Science, most students have found recurrent di culties in using existent tools to nish an introductory assignment. e assignment is related to tasks such as rating prediction and item recommendation to speci c users, using well-known collaborative ltering methods such as User K-NN, Item K-NN, Slope One and FunkSVD [7]. Some of the problems found were: (a) the lack of implementation of certain methods in some libraries, (b) poor train/test time performance under medium-sized datasets (such as Rrecsys which does not implement sparse matrices), (c) lack of functionality which is typical in a recommendation se ing, such us suggesting a list of items given a speci c user ID, (d) di culties to change parameters in certain models, and (e) students' lack of familiarity with certain programming languages such as Java or C#. While Java is the most popular language based on several rankings, it is also the case that Python is the most popular introductory teaching language in the U.S. since 2004 [5] as well as the one with largest growth in the latest 5 years based on the PYPL ranking 1 .\nFor these reasons, we developed pyRecLab 2 . We wrote it in C++ with Python bindings, in order to facilitate its adoption among new programmers familiar with Python, but also o ering an appropriate performance when dealing with larger datasets. We implemented most of the foundational recommendation methods for rating prediction and recommendation. Moreover, users can easily change <h2>publication_ref</h2>['b2', 'b1', 'b3', 'b5', 'b0', 'b6', 'b4']<h2>figure_ref</h2>[]<h2>table_ref</h2>[]<h2>heading</h2>OTHER RECOMMENDATION LIBRARIES<h2>text</h2>MyMediaLite [3]: It implements several recommendation algorithms, supporting explicit and implicit feedback, as well as contextaware methods. It also allows evaluation with metrics such as MAE, RMSE, prec@N, and nDCG [7]. Many of it functionalities are available from command line; however, to integrate it with other soware it is necessary to program in languages like C# or F#, which is di cult for many newcomer Python developers.\nLenskit [2]: A popular library which provides all basic collaborative ltering methods for predicting ratings (User/Item KNN, Slope One and FunkSVD). It is developed in Java, which could be an entry barrier for new programmers who are mostly familiar with Python.\nLibRec [4]: Just like MyMediaLite and Lenskit, a well developed library in terms of algorithms implemented and the metrics available for evaluation. However, documentation is not as good as Lenskit and since it is implemented in Java, it also raises the barrier for new programmers.\nLightfm [6]: is library implements several matrix factorization algorithms for both implicit and explicit feedback. It also has an interface for Python, facilitating its use to several developers. However, it does not implement basic traditional recommender algorithms (User/Item KNN, slope One), so it is not advisable for introductory teaching purposes.\nRrecsys [1]: is tool gets the closest to pyRecLab in terms of easy-of-use, quick prototyping and educational purposes. It is wri en in R language. However, it has two main weaknesses: it misses some traditional algorithms (like Slope One) and it is limited in terms of the amount of data it can process, since it does not support sparse matrices. input le formats (csv, tsv) as well as allowing the user to specify what to le columns represent. • Data handlers. is module implements several data structures, which allow a homogeneous access to the ratings. It grants a good level of independence from the original format from which data were read, with a high level of abstraction. ese data structures will be directly used by the recommendation algorithms for the processing, storage and generation of output data. is module represents the interface between the recommendation algorithms and the Python interpreter. It was developed in C++, and since we aimed at maintaining an appropriate level of code readability, we decided to use the Python/C API rather than Cython for implementation. is allows us to de ne low-level structures in C++ language with a direct mapping with objects handled by the Python interpreter. In this way, we have de ned a data type for each of the recommendation algorithms, which can be instantiated directly from the Python interpreter.<h2>publication_ref</h2>['b2', 'b6', 'b1', 'b3', 'b5', 'b0']<h2>figure_ref</h2>[]<h2>table_ref</h2>[]<h2>heading</h2>DESIGN AND IMPLEMENTATION<h2>text</h2><h2>publication_ref</h2>[]<h2>figure_ref</h2>[]<h2>table_ref</h2>[]<h2>heading</h2>RESULTS & CON\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>PYRECLAB<|>ORGANIZATION<|>pyRecLab is a recommendation system developed to facilitate the adoption of foundational recommendation methods among new programmers, particularly those familiar with Python.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MYMEDIALITE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>MyMediaLite is a recommendation library that implements several algorithms supporting explicit and implicit feedback, as well as context-aware methods.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LENSKIT<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Lenskit is a popular library providing basic collaborative filtering methods for predicting ratings, developed in Java.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LIBREC<|>ORGANIZATION<|>LibRec is a well-developed library in terms of algorithms implemented and metrics available for evaluation, but has less documentation than Lenskit.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LIGHTFM<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Lightfm is a library that implements several matrix factorization algorithms for both implicit and explicit feedback, with an interface for Python.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>RRECSYS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Rrecsys is a tool designed for easy-of-use and educational purposes, written in R language, but has limitations in processing data.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DEPARTMENT OF COMPUTER SCIENCE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The Department of Computer Science is an academic department where a graduate course on Recommender Systems was taught.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>JAVA<|>PERSON<|>Java is a programming language that is popular for its performance but can be a barrier for new programmers.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PYTHON<|>PERSON<|>Python is a programming language that has gained popularity as an introductory teaching language in the U.S. since 2004.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PYRECLAB<|>MYMEDIALITE<|>pyRecLab and MyMediaLite are both recommendation libraries aimed at improving user experience in recommendation systems<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PYRECLAB<|>LENSKIT<|>pyRecLab and Lenskit both provide collaborative filtering methods for predicting ratings<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PYRECLAB<|>LIBREC<|>pyRecLab and LibRec are both libraries that implement various recommendation algorithms<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MYMEDIALITE<|>LENSKIT<|>MyMediaLite and Lenskit are both libraries that provide collaborative filtering methods<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MYMEDIALITE<|>LIBREC<|>MyMediaLite and LibRec are both recommendation libraries with a focus on algorithm implementation<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>LENSKIT<|>LIBREC<|>Lenskit and LibRec are both developed in Java and provide collaborative filtering methods<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>LIGHTFM<|>MYMEDIALITE<|>Lightfm and MyMediaLite are both libraries that implement recommendation algorithms<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>RRECSYS<|>PYRECLAB<|>Rrecsys and pyRecLab are both tools aimed at educational purposes in recommendation systems<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>DEPARTMENT OF COMPUTER SCIENCE<|>PYRECLAB<|>The Department of Computer Science is where the pyRecLab was developed and taught<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>JAVA<|>LENSKIT<|>Java is the programming language used to develop Lenskit, which may pose a barrier for new programmers<|>4)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PYTHON<|>PYRECLAB<|>Python is the language used for the bindings in pyRecLab, facilitating its adoption among new programmers<|>6)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
