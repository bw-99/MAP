We adopt random selection with replacement and uniform crossover with mutation probability 0.01. We set the population size to 250 and the number of generations to 500. All results are the average among 30 independent runs.\nBelow we analyze the performance of different algorithms in terms of the classical hypervolume metric [Shang et al., 2020] with the origin of coordinates as a reference point. In our setup, this metric is to be maximized. We choose NSGA-II as the baseline, and present the relative changes in the hypervolume indicator for the rest of the algorithms in Fig. 7 (increase: positive number, decrease: negative number). We notice that despite having been developed for the manyobjective optimization, NSGA-III almost always results in lower values of hypervolume, even for a large number of knapsacks. This confirms a similar observation from [Ishibuchi et al., 2016], and supports our choice of NSGA-II as a baseline for implementation and comparison instead of NSGA-III. Further, we see that the value of relative increase for PO-count is always very close to 0. It means that PO-count yields a population covering the same hypervolume as NSGA-II. Contrarily, PO-prob improves the hypervolume, as compared to NSGA-II. This difference is visible for small n k (+4% for n k = 2) and is especially prominent for large n k (+60% for n k = 25). For n k between 13 https://deap.readthedocs.io/en/master/ 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8  5 and 7, PO-prob results in lower values of hypervolume than NSGA-II. However, the relative decrease in thes cases does not exceed -1.63%. Also, within this range, PO-count performs slightly better than other algorithms. These results demonstrate that the proposed approach improves the performance of genetic algorithms, especially in the case of many-objective optimization. It also suggests that the choice of the measure µ has a large impact on the performance. The latter relationship will be studied in future work.<h2>publication_ref</h2>['b37', 'b9', 'b45', 'b41', 'b21']<h2>figure_ref</h2>['fig_5']<h2>table_ref</h2>[]<h2>heading</h2>Conclusion<h2>text</h2>In this paper, we formulate the problem of generalized topological sorting with choice maximization, which, to the best of our knowledge, was not considered in the literature before. We also prove that the at least k-Pareto optimal sets provide unique solutions. Further theoretical analysis of this problem leads us to an interesting relationship between the diversity of random points and the arc of hyperbola. Additionally, we propose a computationally efficient algorithm for the calculation of k-Pareto optimality for probability measures. Finally, we demonstrate a successful application of the developed theory. We show that sorting by k-Pareto optimality can drastically improve the performance of many-objective genetic optimization algorithms. In our experiments, the proposed solution based on the probability measure allows increasing the value of hypervolume by up to 60% for 25 objectives. This result can be considered as a potential solution to the problem of searchability deterioration in Paretodominance optimization.\nWe also believe that the proposed general framework can be used in different applications. In future work, we plan to study the applicability of k-Pareto optimality for constrained optimization, scheduling problems, recommender systems, and the development of statistical indicators. Maximization of choice might be also useful when studying causality and fairness.<h2>publication_ref</h2>[]<h2>figure_ref</h2>[]<h2>table_ref</h2>[]<h2>heading</h2>A.2 Cone-based Relations<h2>text</h2>Let us again consider the unit square, the Lebesgue measure, and a positive constant a. However, this time the preference relation is defined as follows: yR a x iff y 2 ≤ x 2 and x 2 -y 2 ≥ a(y 1 -x 1 ). The above relation R a is an example of a cone-based relation illustrated in Fig. 9. This relation has the intuitive meaning of giving up (x 1 , x 2 ) for getting (y 1 , y 2 ) if the improvement (diminution) in the second characteristic is at least a times the trade-off (increase) in the first characteristic. In this case, selections are sets delimited by descending curves Let us now consider the sets of at least k-Pareto optimal elements of measure 0.25 for the three values of a: a = 1 10 , a = 1 2 , and a = 2, see Fig. 8b. Larger values of a represent higher maximum accepted trade-offs. This is represented by the gradual degeneration of the hyperbola into a straight horizontal line when a increases. As shown in the figure, the three sets demonstrate plausible behavior. In the situation discussed in Appendix A.1, the relation R corresponds to the extreme case of the relation R a with a = 0.\nx 2 = f (x 1 ) such that -1 a ≤ df dx1 ≤ 0.<h2>publication_ref</h2>[]<h2>figure_ref</h2>['fig_6']<h2>table_ref</h2>[]<h2>heading</h2>A.3 Transitive relations<h2>text</h2>In general, it is\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>NSGA-II<|>ORGANIZATION<|>NSGA-II is a genetic algorithm used as a baseline for performance comparison in many-objective optimization tasks.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>NSGA-III<|>ORGANIZATION<|>NSGA-III is a genetic algorithm that is compared against NSGA-II in terms of hypervolume performance.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PO-COUNT<|>ORGANIZATION<|>PO-count is an algorithm that yields a population covering the same hypervolume as NSGA-II.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PO-PROB<|>ORGANIZATION<|>PO-prob is an algorithm that improves hypervolume compared to NSGA-II, especially for larger numbers of objectives.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>HYPERVOLUME<|>EVENT<|>Hypervolume is a metric used to evaluate the performance of different algorithms in optimization tasks.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>K-PARETO OPTIMALITY<|>EVENT<|>K-Pareto optimality is a concept in optimization that provides unique solutions for sorting problems.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GENETIC ALGORITHMS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Genetic algorithms are optimization algorithms inspired by the process of natural selection, used in various applications.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>NSGA-II<|>NSGA-III<|>NSGA-III is compared against NSGA-II to evaluate performance in terms of hypervolume<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PO-COUNT<|>NSGA-II<|>PO-count yields a population covering the same hypervolume as NSGA-II<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PO-PROB<|>NSGA-II<|>PO-prob improves hypervolume compared to NSGA-II, indicating a better performance<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>HYPERVOLUME<|>NSGA-II<|>Hypervolume is the metric used to evaluate the performance of NSGA-II<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>K-PARETO OPTIMALITY<|>GENETIC ALGORITHMS<|>K-Pareto optimality is applied within the context of genetic algorithms for optimization<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>K-PARETO OPTIMALITY<|>HYPERVOLUME<|>K-Pareto optimality aims to maximize hypervolume in optimization tasks<|>7)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
