In this paper, we assume each dimension of the review embedding represents different perspectives and aspects of the user's feedback on the interacted item. In order to establish the connection between reviews and items, we first generate the average review embeddings of items, and calculate the dimension-based relations between user reviews and the corresponding item products as:\nD = Rùëá e (0) ùëñ (4)\nwhere R ‚àà R | I | √óùëë is the average review embedding of the item over valid reviews written by users; D ‚àà R ùëë √óùëë is the cross-relation matrix that captures the relationship between the dimensions of the review embeddings and the item embeddings. The matrix can also be treated as a projection matrix from the latent space of user reviews toward the space of item contents. Once we have the relationship matrix between reviews and items, we can determine the dimension-based attention weight of each review towards the interacted items by multiplying the relationship matrix with the user review. Eventually, we utilize this pre-computed dimensionbased attention weight to determine the significance of different interacted items by the weighted sum of the initial item embeddings for initializing user representations.\ne (0) ùë¢ = ‚àëÔ∏Å ùëñ ‚àà N ùë¢ exp(e ùëü ùë¢,ùëñ √ó D) ùëó ‚àà N ùë¢ exp(e ùëü ùë¢,ùëó √ó D) ‚äô e (0) ùëñ(5)\nwhere √ó denotes matrix multiplication, ‚äô represents element-wise multiplication (dot), and e\n(0)\nùë¢ denotes the user embedding for user ùë¢ as the input of the graph network.<h2>publication_ref</h2>[]<h2>figure_ref</h2>[]<h2>table_ref</h2>[]<h2>heading</h2>User-Item Embedding Propagation and Interaction Modeling (EPIM)<h2>text</h2>For the user-item embedding propagation phase, we leverage the structure of the graph convolutional network [12] to learn user and item embeddings via pair-wise interactions.<h2>publication_ref</h2>['b11']<h2>figure_ref</h2>[]<h2>table_ref</h2>[]<h2>heading</h2>Message<h2>text</h2>Passing and Message Aggregation. We empirically follow message passing and aggregation methods similar to previous works [12,36] to adopt mean aggregation in each graph convolutional layer.

After computing ùêø layers of propagation by Equation 6 and 7, we would like to aggregate different high-order relationships extracted by disparate graph convolutional layers. We simply follow a similar strategy as LightGCN [12] does, using mean pooling to combine the embeddings distilled at each layer to form the final user and item representations. \nwhere e ùë¢ and e ùëñ are the final representations of user ùë¢ and item ùëñ.<h2>publication_ref</h2>['b11', 'b35', 'b11']<h2>figure_ref</h2>[]<h2>table_ref</h2>[]<h2>heading</h2>Interaction Modeling Layer.<h2>text</h2>For the final layer of the proposed model, the naive inner product operation is applied to estimate a user's preference toward a target item, which can be formulated as:\n≈∑ùë¢ùëñ = e ùë¢ ‚Ä¢ e ùëñ(9)\nwhere ≈∑ùë¢ùëñ denotes the matching score of the user ùë¢ and item ùëñ.<h2>publication_ref</h2>[]<h2>figure_ref</h2>[]<h2>table_ref</h2>[]<h2>heading</h2>Learning and Optimization<h2>text</h2>To optimize printf, we introduce the loss functions used by each component in the framework, including alignment loss, Auto-Encoder loss, and Bayesian Personal\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}}
