Different from DARTS-style works [7], [17], [19] that use bi-level optimization to iteratively update A and W(A), we follow the setting of [36] and use one-level optimization to simultaneously train A and W(A) on the training set T . In addition to being time-consuming, [36] empirically demonstrated that bi-level optimization might downgrade the final performance due to the accumulation of errors from multiple approximations. On the other hand, we argue that there are many causes that can affect the performance and stability of bi-level optimization, such as the size of the validation set and the switch interval during iterative training. Hence, we adopt one-level optimization for practicality and efficiency by simultaneously updating A and W(A) via gradient descent as follows:\n‚àÇ A L (T ; A, W (A)) and ‚àÇ W(A) L (T ; A, W (A)).

For instance, assume there is a field that has three candidate dimensions with corresponding weights of 0.33, 0.33, 0.34. It is difficult to judge which operator is better since the gap is too small, and dropping all of the relatively smaller operators can lead to a dilemma that the total weight of the dropped operators is much higher than the selected one. Moreover, due to randomness during DNN model training, the derived optimal operators can also be unstable. To alleviate such issues, we set a cumulative probability threshold (CPT) to flexibly adjust the minimum amount of information kept in the retraining stage, supplemented with a pruning algorithm to derive the embedding dimension d fi for each field f i . The details are presented in Algorithm 1. The intuition behind this is that embedding regions with higher weights contain more effective information and should be retained in preference during pruning.\nRecall that d fi = 0 means that the corresponding field f i is useless and thus can be removed in the retraining stage. By applying Algorithm 1 to each field separately, we simultaneously complete feature selection and dimension search to obtain the pruned neural architecture of the retraining model. Compared with those selection algorithms based on the argmax operator, the proposed CPT-based pruning algorithm can generate more fine-grained embedding dimension configurations. Meanwhile, our algorithm can cover some common embedding search methods by flexibly adjusting the threshold. For example, the argmax operator in DART-style work [17], [19] becomes a special case with cpt = 0, while cpt = 1 means retaining all regions. </p><h\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>CPT-BASED PRUNING ALGORITHM<|>concept<|>The CPT-based Pruning Algorithm is a method for selecting features and optimizing dimensions in neural networks, utilizing a cumulative probability threshold to retain important information during retraining.)\n(\"entity\"<|>PRETRAINING<|>concept<|>Pretraining is the initial phase in training a neural network where the model learns from a dataset before fine-tuning on a specific task.)\n(\"entity\"<|>SEARCH SPACE<|>concept<|>The search space refers to the set of possible configurations or dimensions that can be explored during the optimization process in neural networks.)\n(\"entity\"<|>DIMENSION SIZE<|>concept<|>Dimension size refers to the number of features or parameters in a model that can be adjusted or pruned during the training process.)\n(\"entity\"<|>DNN MODEL<|>concept<|>DNN model refers to a deep neural network that is trained to perform tasks such as classification or regression based on input data.)\n(\"entity\"<|>GRADIENT DESCENT<|>concept<|>Gradient descent is an optimization algorithm used to minimize the loss function in machine learning by iteratively adjusting model parameters.)\n(\"entity\"<|>OPTIMAL SUBSET<|>concept<|>Optimal subset refers to the best selection of features or dimensions that contribute most effectively to the model's performance.)\n(\"entity\"<|>RETRAINING STAGE<|>concept<|>The retraining stage is the phase where the model is fine-tuned using the selected features and dimensions after pretraining.)\n(\"relationship\"<|>CPT-BASED PRUNING ALGORITHM<|>DNN MODEL<|>The CPT-based Pruning Algorithm is applied to optimize the DNN model by selecting features and dimensions during retraining<|>9)\n(\"relationship\"<|>PRETRAINING<|>DNN MODEL<|>Pretraining is a crucial step in preparing the DNN model for effective learning and performance<|>8)\n(\"relationship\"<|>SEARCH SPACE<|>DIMENSION SIZE<|>The search space includes various dimension sizes that can be explored for optimizing the model<|>7)\n(\"relationship\"<|>DIMENSION SIZE<|>OPTIMAL SUBSET<|>The optimal subset is derived from the dimension sizes that are most effective for the model<|>6)\n(\"relationship\"<|>RETRAINING STAGE<|>DNN MODEL<|>The retraining stage involves fine-tuning the DNN model using the selected features and dimensions<|>8)\n(\"relationship\"<|>GRADIENT DESCENT<|>DNN MODEL<|>Gradient descent is used to optimize the parameters of the DNN model during training<|>7)\n(\"relationship\"<|>CPT-BASED PRUNING ALGORITHM<|>RETRAINING STAGE<|>The CPT-based Pruning Algorithm is utilized during the retraining stage to refine the model<|>8) \n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
