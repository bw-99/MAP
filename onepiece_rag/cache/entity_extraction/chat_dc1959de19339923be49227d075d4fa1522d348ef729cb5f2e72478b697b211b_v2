We then review traditional graph convolutional networks (GCNs) that constitute the analytical basis for our solution approach. Finally, we formulate the problem of GitHub repository recommendation and offer the main insight behind the adopted solution.<h2>publication_ref</h2>[]<h2>figure_ref</h2>[]<h2>table_ref</h2>[]<h2>heading</h2>Background and Motivation<h2>text</h2>GitHub is a social application platform, where users can collaborate on open source projects and share code with others. Users can create different repositories (i.e., digital directories) to store files and source code for their research projects. Fig. 1 illustrates an example of the Tensorflow repository for deep learning. The repository contains basic information such as descriptions, tags (also called topics), and user starring. Descriptions refer to a couple of sentences that describe the repository. Tags are keywords used to classify a repository, including its purpose and subject area. Starring a repository represents an expression of interest from a user in the repository. Much like browser bookmarks, stars give users improved shortcut-like access to repository information.\nConsider a simple example to motivate features of our solution approach based on real-world data sets collected from GitHub and Microsoft Academic. Fig. 2 illustrates selected repositories and papers in the two different platforms. Repository R 1 is the original open source code for paper P 1 , ResNeXt [25], which presents a highly modularized network architecture for image classification developed by Facebook Research. The pair of R 1 and P 1 could be used as a bridge to connect the GitHub platform and Microsoft Academic platform. In addition, we find that users who star the repository R 1 also star certain other repositories related to image classification and deep neural networks. We collect 540 users who star repository R 1 and discover that 241 of them (such as user U 1 ) star R 4 as well. Thus, we infer that the two repositories starred by many of the same users are likely related to each other. We can also find repositories in the same subarea or topic that have similar tags. Take repository R 2 and R 3 , for example. These two repositories are related to image classification and they have the same tag \"ImageNet\". In this paper, we use both user starring and tags to construct a context graph for repositories.\nIn the papers domain, related papers are connected together via citation relationships. As illustrated in It has more than 100 citing/cited papers. Most of them are also involved in the same or similar areas as P 1 . For example, paper P 1 cites paper P 2 , P 3 , and P 4 that are related to image classification using deep neural networks. Paper P 3 cites P 2 and P 4 because they share the same research topics on deep residual networks. Hence, related papers can be identified from the paper citation graph. We further find that the more edges (connections) exist among papers, the more related they are. These observations form the basis of constructing the context graph for publications.\nFinally, we feed both the context graphs (describing relations) and content information (describing nodes), such as raw paper abstracts and repository descriptions, into the graph convolutional neural networks framework to perform joint embedding.<h2>publication_ref</h2>['b24']<h2>figure_ref</h2>['fig_0', 'fig_2']<h2>table_ref</h2>[]<h2>heading</h2>Graph Convolutional Networks<h2>text</h2>Graph convolutional networks (GCNs) [2,12] have been widely used in classification and recommendation systems because they encode both the graph neighborhood and content information of nodes to be classified or recommended. The basic idea of GCNs is to learn the embeddings of nodes based on both their input features, X, and graph structures. The graph structure is often denoted by an adjacency matrix, A. A multi-layer GCN forward model could be expressed by:\nH (l +1) = σ D-1 2 Ã D-1 2 H (l ) W (l ) ,(1)\nwhere Ã = A + I N , A is the adjacency matrix for the input graph structure and I N is the identity matrix, Dii = j Ãij , W (l ) is the weight matrix to be trained, σ (.) is the activation function such as ReLU, H (l ) is the hidden layer, l is the layer index and H (0) = X is the input features of nodes. Because the embeddings of papers and repositories generated by traditional GCNs for the two different platforms are not in the same space, it is necessary for us to jointly train the corresponding neural networks subject to a constraint that aligns the projections of related papers and repositories onto the same (or neighboring) points in the embedding space. The above challenge leads to the following research problem formulation.<h2>publication_ref</h2>['b1', 'b11']<h2>figure_ref</h2>[]<h2>table_ref</h2>[]<h2>heading</h2>Problem Statement and Solution Idea<h2>text</h2>Suppose there are N p papers in an academic search system, such as Microsoft Academic, and N r repositories on GitHub.
