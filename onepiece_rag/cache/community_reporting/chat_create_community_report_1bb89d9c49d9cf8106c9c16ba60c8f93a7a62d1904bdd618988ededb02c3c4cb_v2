It measures the proportion of relevant items successfully retrieved from the total available relevant items, providing insights into system performance. For instance, in a recommendation system, a high recall indicates that users are being presented with a significant number of relevant options, enhancing user satisfaction and engagement. This metric is crucial for developers aiming to optimize their algorithms for better user experiences.

It affects how well a system can present varied options to users, which is essential for maintaining user interest and engagement. For example, a recommendation system that retrieves items solely based on high relevance may lead to a lack of variety, potentially causing user disengagement. By incorporating diversity into the retrieval process, systems can enhance user experiences by offering a wider array of choices that cater to different preferences.
