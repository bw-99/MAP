It measures the degree to which the geometry of a manifold deviates from being flat, which is essential for understanding the intrinsic properties of spaces. In the context of graphs, Ricci curvature is specifically applied to the edges, allowing for the integration of graph structures into continuous hyperbolic embedding spaces. This integration facilitates a deeper understanding of hierarchical relationships within graphs. Additionally, Ricci curvature serves as a specific type of graph curvature that allocates curvature to the edges, helping to control the overlap between two distance balls in the graph.
