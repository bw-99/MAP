It ensures that there are at least k disjoint paths between any two nodes, which is crucial for maintaining connectivity even in the face of failures. Specifically, k-connectivity denotes the minimum number of nodes (or vertices) whose removal would disconnect the graph, thereby highlighting the network's resilience. This property guarantees that the graph remains connected despite the deletion of up to (k-1) nodes or edges, allowing for multiple disjoint paths between node pairs.
