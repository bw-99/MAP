It represents a specific job or piece of work that must be completed, typically within a defined timeframe. In the context of real-time systems, a task is a unit of work that requires scheduling and execution within a specific time frame, often characterized by its execution time and deadline. Overall, a task encompasses the essential elements of work that need to be managed and executed effectively within a system.\",17\n835,UTILIZATION,Utilization refers to a metric that assesses the extent to which a processor's capacity is being utilized by a specific task or a collection of tasks within a scheduling framework. It serves as an indicator of the amount of computational resources that a task demands in relation to the total resources available in a system. This concept is crucial for understanding resource allocation and efficiency in computing environments.,2\n872,RELATIVE DEADLINE,\"The term \"\"Relative Deadline\"\" refers to the specific time by which a task must be completed in relation to its release time. This concept is crucial for ensuring timely task execution in real-time systems, as it helps in determining the feasibility of tasks during the scheduling process. By establishing a relative deadline, system designers can effectively manage and prioritize tasks to meet operational requirements and maintain system performance.\",2\n836,ABSOLUTE DEADLINE,\"The term \"\"Absolute Deadline\"\" refers to a specific point in time by which a task must be completed. It is commonly utilized in scheduling to ensure that tasks adhere to their timing requirements. Unlike a relative deadline, which may depend on the completion of other tasks, an absolute deadline is fixed and unequivocal, emphasizing the importance of timely task completion.\",2\n857,IMPLICIT DEADLINES,\"Implicit deadlines refer to a scheduling model where the deadline of a task is defined by its period, meaning that a task must complete before its next release time.\",1\n883,FRAME,\"A frame is a segment of a task that can have different execution times and deadlines, contributing to the overall behavior of the task in a scheduling context.\",1\n885,CONSTRAINED DEADLINE,\"A constrained deadline is a type of deadline in which tasks must complete their execution within a specified time frame, critical for real-time systems.\",1\n1054,EXECUTION,Execution refers to the process of carrying out a task or command in a computational environment.,1\n706,EXECUTION TIME,,6\n851,RELEASE TIME R I,Release time r i is the moment when a task τ i becomes available for execution in the scheduling context.,1\n860,PERIODIC TASK,\"A periodic task is a task that is executed at regular intervals, characterized by its period, execution time, relative deadline, and jitter.
