It computes daily stock returns over recent periods, allowing investors to assess the change in momentum of a stock. This concept refers to the tendency of stocks to continue moving in the same direction for a certain period, which can significantly influence investment decisions. By understanding momentum, investors can make more informed choices, capitalizing on the persistence of stock price movements.\",2\n650,VALUE,\"VALUE refers to a financial concept that encompasses various factors used to evaluate a company's performance in relation to its market value. Key value factors include financial ratios such as book-to-market and asset-to-market ratios, which provide insights into how a company's financial health compares to its market valuation. The value approach involves selecting stocks that are perceived to be undervalued based on fundamental analysis, thereby influencing investment strategies. This methodology aims to identify opportunities where the market may not fully recognize a company's intrinsic worth, allowing investors to capitalize on potential growth as the market corrects these discrepancies.\",2\n651,GROWTH,\"GROWTH refers to the various factors that contribute to the increase in a company's assets, market value, sales, and profits over time. It emphasizes companies that are anticipated to grow at an above-average rate relative to their industry, which significantly influences investment decisions. This focus on growth is crucial for investors seeking opportunities in dynamic markets, as it highlights potential for substantial returns based on the company's performance trajectory.\",2\n655,STABILITY,\"Stability, in the context of predictive modeling, refers to the consistency of a factor's contribution over time. It is measured by the frequency with which a factor's impact on predictions changes direction, flipping from positive to negative or vice versa.
