Specifically, it is denoted as G(n, K n, P n) or G(n, X n, Y n), where 'n' represents the number of nodes, and the parameters K, P, X, and Y define the characteristics of the graph.\n\nThis type of graph is particularly significant in the study of connectivity and edge probabilities, as it helps analyze the reliability of networks that may have unreliable links. In a random key graph, nodes are assigned distinct objects, and edges are formed based on probabilistic rules, where two nodes are considered adjacent if their key rings share at least one key.
