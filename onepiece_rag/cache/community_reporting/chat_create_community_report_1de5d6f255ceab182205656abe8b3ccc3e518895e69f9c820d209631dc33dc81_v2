This issue arises when users have rated only a limited number of items, making it difficult for algorithms to generate accurate and personalized recommendations. For instance, in a movie recommendation system, if a user has only rated a few films, the system struggles to suggest new movies that align with the user's preferences.

For example, when a new user joins a platform, their preferences are unknown, making it challenging for the system to suggest relevant content. Similarly, new items without user ratings cannot be effectively recommended. This problem highlights the need for innovative solutions to gather initial data or leverage existing data from similar users or items to mitigate the cold start effect.
