These laws indicate that as the number of nodes in a random graph increases, certain properties—such as k-connectivity and minimum node degree—will almost surely either hold true or fail to hold true, with probabilities approaching one or zero, respectively. Essentially, zero-one laws provide a framework for understanding the conditions under which particular events in random graphs are likely to occur as the graph size tends toward infinity.\",3\n832,G_ON,\"G_on is a model representing the intersection of a random key graph and an Erdős-Rényi graph, capturing the behavior of networks with unreliable links.\",4\n828,K-CONNECTIVITY,\"K-CONNECTIVITY is a fundamental property of graphs that signifies the robustness and resilience of a network. Specifically, it indicates that there are at least k mutually disjoint paths between any pair of nodes, ensuring that the network remains connected even in the event of node failures. This property is crucial for maintaining communication security and resiliency against attacks, as it defines the minimum number of nodes that must be removed to disconnect the remaining nodes. In essence, k-connectivity measures a graph's ability to sustain connectivity despite the removal of up to (k - 1) nodes, highlighting the existence of multiple node-disjoint paths that facilitate uninterrupted communication within the network.\",7\n829,ERDŐS-RÉNYI GRAPH,\"The Erdős-Rényi graph is a well-known random graph model in graph theory, characterized by a fixed number of nodes, denoted as n.
