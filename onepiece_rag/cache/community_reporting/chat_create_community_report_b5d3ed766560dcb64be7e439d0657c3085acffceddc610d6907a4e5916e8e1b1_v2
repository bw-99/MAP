sections:\n\n- TITLE: community's name that represents its key entities - title should be short but specific. When possible, include representative named entities in the title.\n- SUMMARY: An executive summary of the community's overall structure, how its entities are related to each other, and significant information associated with its entities.\n- IMPACT SEVERITY RATING: a float score between 0-10 that represents the severity of IMPACT posed by entities within the community.  IMPACT is the scored importance of a community.\n- RATING EXPLANATION: Give a single sentence explanation of the IMPACT severity rating.\n- DETAILED FINDINGS: A list of 5-10 key insights about the community. Each insight should have a short summary followed by multiple paragraphs of explanatory text grounded according to the grounding rules below. Be comprehensive.\n\nReturn output as a well-formed JSON-formatted string with the following format:\n    {{\n        \"title\": <report_title>,\n        \"summary\": <executive_summary>,\n        \"rating\": <impact_severity_rating>,\n        \"rating_explanation\": <rating_explanation>,\n        \"findings\": [\n            {{\n                \"summary\":<insight_1_summary>,\n                \"explanation\": <insight_1_explanation>\n            }},\n            {{\n                \"summary\":<insight_2_summary>,\n                \"explanation\": <insight_2_explanation>\n            }}\n        ]\n    }}\n\n# Grounding Rules\n\nPoints supported by data should list their data references as follows:\n\n\"This is an example sentence supported by multiple data references [Data: <dataset name> (record ids); <dataset name> (record ids)].\"\n\nDo not list more than 5 record ids in a single reference.
