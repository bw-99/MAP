By normalizing the inputs to each layer, it reduces internal covariate shift, allowing for faster convergence and improved performance. This technique is widely adopted in various machine learning applications, making it a cornerstone of modern deep learning practices. Its significance is underscored by its integration into many state-of-the-art models, which rely on batch normalization to achieve optimal results.
