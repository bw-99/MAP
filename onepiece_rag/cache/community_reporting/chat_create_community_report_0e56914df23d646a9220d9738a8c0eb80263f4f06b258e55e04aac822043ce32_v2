The technique aims to ensure that the activations of each layer are approximately normally distributed, which is crucial for maintaining the stability of the learning process. By transforming the inputs to follow a Gaussian distribution, Batch Normalization helps in mitigating issues related to vanishing and exploding gradients, thus enhancing the overall training dynamics of deep learning models.
