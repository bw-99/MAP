In this scheduling algorithm, tasks with higher priorities are executed before those with lower priorities. The scheduler consistently selects the highest-priority task that is ready to run, ensuring timely execution of critical tasks. This approach is particularly important in environments where meeting deadlines is essential, as it prioritizes the execution of tasks based on their assigned importance.
