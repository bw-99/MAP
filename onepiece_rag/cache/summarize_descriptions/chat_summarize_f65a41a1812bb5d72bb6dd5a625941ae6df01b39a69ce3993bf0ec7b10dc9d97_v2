As a dataset, DISEASE is characterized as a pure tree-like structure utilized in node classification tasks, presenting challenges in learning asymmetric dependencies when applying the ùúÖHC method. It exhibits a hyperbolic structure, making it particularly suitable for hyperbolic models in machine learning applications. This dataset focuses on the classification of diseases based on various features, aiding in the understanding and categorization of medical conditions.\n\nIn a broader context, the term \"disease\" also refers to a medical condition that disrupts the normal functioning of the body or mind, often necessitating diagnosis and treatment.
