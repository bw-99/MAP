DNNs serve as a fundamental element in recommendation systems, where they are responsible for generating embedding vectors that encapsulate user behavior and item scores. These embedding vectors are crucial for understanding the relationships between users and items. Furthermore, DNNs are employed in both the filtering and ranking stages of recommendation systems, effectively processing user data to produce tailored recommendations. This integration highlights the significant role of DNNs in enhancing the performance and accuracy of RECSYS.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1735385115, "model": "gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_0aa8d3e20b", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 120, "prompt_tokens": 179, "total_tokens": 299, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
