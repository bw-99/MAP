It achieves this by representing users through multiple distinct topical affinities, which allows for a more nuanced understanding of user interests. By utilizing multiple embeddings to capture these varied interests, KNN-EMBED broadens the range of items retrieved, ensuring that the recommendations are not only relevant but also diverse. This dual focus on distinct topical representations and varied embeddings positions KNN-EMBED as a powerful tool for improving the richness and variety of retrieval outcomes in recommendation systems.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1735731366, "model": "gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_0aa8d3e20b", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 111, "prompt_tokens": 291, "total_tokens": 402, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are an expert in community analysis and machine learning.
