This model is particularly effective in improving gene expression predictions, especially in scenarios where data is limited. Additionally, CellPLM serves as a pre-training method for cell language models, extending its application beyond traditional single-cell analysis. Through its innovative approach, CellPLM contributes significantly to the field of transcriptomics by facilitating a deeper insight into cellular interactions and gene expression dynamics.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1735442626, "model": "gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_d02d531b47", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 104, "prompt_tokens": 213, "total_tokens": 317, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
