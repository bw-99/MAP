This approach utilizes nearest-neighbor smoothing to boost the recall of retrieved items in candidate retrieval tasks by leveraging information from neighboring users. kNN-Embed operates under the assumption of a set of co-embedded user and item embeddings, remaining agnostic to the specific embedding technique employed, while focusing on the relevance between users and items. Additionally, it aims to enhance diversity in candidate retrieval by representing users as a mixture over learned item clusters that reflect their distinct interests. Overall, kNN-Embed seeks to better model user interests and improve retrieval recall and diversity, making it a valuable tool in the realm of user-item interactions.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1735731306, "model": "gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_d02d531b47", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 158, "prompt_tokens": 403, "total_tokens": 561, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are an expert in community analysis and machine learning.
