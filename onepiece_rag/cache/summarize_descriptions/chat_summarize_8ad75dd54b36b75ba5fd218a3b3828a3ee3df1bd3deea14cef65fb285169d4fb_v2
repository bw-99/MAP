These systems are widely employed across various domains, including e-commerce, content platforms, online advertising, and social media. They leverage complex algorithms to rank and filter items, providing personalized recommendations that enhance user experience. By utilizing machine learning techniques, recommender systems can predict user preferences with greater accuracy, often incorporating multiple features and dimensions to refine their suggestions. Additionally, they harness information technology and deep learning to sift through vast arrays of options, relying on input features from users, items, and contextual data to deliver tailored recommendations.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1735731225, "model": "gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_d02d531b47", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 125, "prompt_tokens": 451, "total_tokens": 576, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are an expert in community analysis and machine learning.
