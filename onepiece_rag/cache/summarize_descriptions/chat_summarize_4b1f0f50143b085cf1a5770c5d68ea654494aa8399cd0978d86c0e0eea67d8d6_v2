This framework serves as a mathematical model that underpins the development of utilization-based schedulability tests and response time analyses within scheduling systems. Additionally, the K2Q Framework is utilized for deriving quadratic bounds or utilization bounds in scheduling algorithms, specifically focusing on fixed-priority scheduling in uniprocessor systems.
