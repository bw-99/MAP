In this model, each edge between pairs of nodes is included with a specific probability, p, which remains constant across all pairs and is independent of the presence of other edges. This probabilistic approach allows for the study of random connections within networks, making Erdős-Rényi graphs a fundamental tool for analyzing the properties and behaviors of random networks.
