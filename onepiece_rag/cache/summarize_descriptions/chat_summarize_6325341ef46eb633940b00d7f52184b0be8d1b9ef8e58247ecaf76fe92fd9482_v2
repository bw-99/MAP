It is often used to denote the mean or expected value, serving as a crucial parameter in statistical analysis. In addition to its role in statistics, µ is also defined as a constant within the range of (0, 1/2), selected to meet specific conditions in various propositions. Furthermore, µ functions as a measure in the context of the knapsack problem, where it is employed to evaluate the total weight of a set of items. Overall, µ is a versatile symbol that plays significant roles in both theoretical and applied mathematics.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1735442690, "model": "gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_d02d531b47", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 135, "prompt_tokens": 217, "total_tokens": 352, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
