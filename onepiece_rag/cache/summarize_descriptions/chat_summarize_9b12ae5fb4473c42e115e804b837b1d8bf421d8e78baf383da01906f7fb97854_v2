It represents a specific condition or state within probability equations and also denotes a specific event or outcome in probability statements. Additionally, \"Κ\" is defined as the connectivity of the graph G, indicating the minimum number of nodes whose removal would render the graph disconnected. Furthermore, \"Κ\" is associated with curvature values that are utilized to capture local structures in hyperbolic space, which are computed through softmax operations. This diverse set of definitions highlights \"Κ\" as a crucial element in both probabilistic frameworks and graph theory, as well as in the study of geometric structures in hyperbolic space.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1735731228, "model": "gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_d02d531b47", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 138, "prompt_tokens": 320, "total_tokens": 458, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are an expert in community analysis and machine learning.
