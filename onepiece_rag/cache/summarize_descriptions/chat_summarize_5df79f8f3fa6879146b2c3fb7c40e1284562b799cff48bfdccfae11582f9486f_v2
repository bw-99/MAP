It plays a significant role in automatic feature selection, enhancing the efficiency and effectiveness of machine learning processes. Additionally, AutoField is employed in the performance comparison of the iHAS model against baseline models, providing a framework for evaluating model performance. The term \"Autofield\" is also the title of a paper published in 2020, which discusses the automation of feature selection specifically in deep recommender systems.
