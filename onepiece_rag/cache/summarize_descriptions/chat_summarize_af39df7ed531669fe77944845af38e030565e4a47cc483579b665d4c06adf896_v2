It serves as a single-cell perturbation modeling framework that employs optimal mass transport on the manifold of Gaussian mixtures to analyze single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data. This framework is particularly adept at predicting gene expression changes following perturbations, such as gene knockdowns.\n\nThe SC-OTGM model is designed to predict the direction of expression changes in differentially expressed genes, making it a valuable tool for researchers. It is scalable and unified, facilitating various applications including cell state classification, differential gene expression analysis, gene ranking for target identification, and perturbation response prediction. Additionally, SC-OTGM can generate synthetic scRNA-seq data by sampling from the posteriors of Gaussian components.\n\nEvaluated for its effectiveness, SC-OTGM has demonstrated high accuracy in predicting differential gene expression in CRISPR interference (CRISPRi) experiments, proving its reliability in identifying perturbed genes. Overall, SC-OTGM represents a significant advancement in the analysis of single-cell data and the understanding of gene expression dynamics in response to perturbations.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1735442621, "model": "gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_d02d531b47", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 247, "prompt_tokens": 313, "total_tokens": 560, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
