It aims to enhance model performance and parameter efficiency by optimizing input configurations, which includes pruning unnecessary fields and assigning adaptive embedding dimensions. This approach not only improves prediction accuracy but also reduces complexity in machine learning models.\n\nThe I-RAZOR framework evaluates the importance of each feature in relation to its optimal embedding dimension, providing a practical method for optimizing feature selection and dimension search processes. It elegantly transforms the joint optimization of these tasks into an operator selection process, which enhances flexibility and interpretability in feature engineering, particularly in recommendation scenarios.\n\nI-RAZOR is also noted for its application in hyperparameter tuning, focusing on parameters such as threshold cpt and weight coefficient λ to further optimize performance in various machine learning tasks. The model has demonstrated significant advantages in feature selection and dimension search across datasets like Avazu and Criteo, making it a valuable tool for improving predictive performance and model compression in click-through rate (CTR) prediction tasks. Overall, I-RAZOR represents a comprehensive and innovative approach to enhancing the efficiency and effectiveness of recommender systems.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1735442708, "model": "gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_0aa8d3e20b", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 244, "prompt_tokens": 511, "total_tokens": 755, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
