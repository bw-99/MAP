Dimension search is integral to the i-Razor method, facilitating the optimization of embedding dimensions within the model. The i-Razor framework not only focuses on dimension search but also incorporates it into the broader optimization process, ensuring that unnecessary fields are pruned while adaptive embedding dimensions are assigned. This strategic approach links dimension search with feature selection, ultimately enhancing the model's performance through effective optimization strategies.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1735442933, "model": "gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_d02d531b47", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 107, "prompt_tokens": 248, "total_tokens": 355, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
