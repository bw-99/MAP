It compares the performance of different sizes of datasets while maintaining consistent parameters, and it also depicts the raw rating distribution for a sample of Jester. Additionally, Figure 5 discusses the performance comparison for varying margin parameters when K is set to 10, highlighting the optimal margin for achieving the best performance.\n\nThe figure displays the allocation of embedding dimensions to both single fields and cross fields within the Avazu-FG dataset. It further illustrates the selections of the best 40% based on different sorting criteria. Moreover, Figure 5 presents the comparison results of various recommendation methods as the value of K increases, utilizing three key measures: HR@K, MRR@K, and MAP@K. It is referenced in the context of analyzing the performance of different algorithms and is likely used to illustrate concepts related to the mathematical assertions made in the document.
