It is primarily utilized in proofs related to scheduling or optimization problems. Specifically, Formula 35 describes a union of sets that includes T* k and another set A, which is defined as a subset of T_k, excluding T* k. Additionally, it establishes a mathematical relationship among the variables Z, m, n, and others, while imposing specific constraints on their values.
