Formula coordinates serve as a spatial or numerical reference, indicating the layout and position of the formula in relation to its identifier. They provide essential context for the mathematical representation, allowing for the identification and graphical representation of the formula.\n\nEach formula ID is associated with its respective formula coordinates, which uniquely identify the graphical representation of the formula and facilitate the referencing of numerical values. This relationship ensures that the coordinates are not only linked to the formula ID for identification purposes but also provide a structured format for locating and visualizing the formulas. Overall, formula coordinates are crucial for providing context and reference for mathematical expressions, ensuring clarity and precision in their representation.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1735442915, "model": "gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_0aa8d3e20b", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 167, "prompt_tokens": 586, "total_tokens": 753, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
