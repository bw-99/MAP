It generates a ranked list of suspicious code statements by analyzing bug reports and applying fix patterns, thereby facilitating the identification of buggy code locations, even in the absence of test cases. The tool employs a repair pipeline that drives the fault localization process and the generation of patches, ensuring that the patches produced are validated through regression testing.\n\niFixR is designed to address practical constraints faced by developers, such as limited test cases, and utilizes techniques like fault localization, pattern matching, and code mutation to create effective patch candidates. Its performance has been evaluated against the Defects4J benchmark, demonstrating promising results in recommending plausible patches for software bugs. Overall, iFixR represents a significant advancement in the field of automated program repair, aiming to streamline the software maintenance process by automatically generating patches from bug reports.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1735731256, "model": "gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_0aa8d3e20b", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 188, "prompt_tokens": 589, "total_tokens": 777, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are an expert in community analysis and machine learning.
