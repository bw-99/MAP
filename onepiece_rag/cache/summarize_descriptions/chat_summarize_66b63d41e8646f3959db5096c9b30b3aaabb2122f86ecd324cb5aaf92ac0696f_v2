This innovative algorithm addresses the inefficiencies associated with traditional sequential optimization methods by enabling joint optimization of feature selection and embedding dimension search within deep neural networks (DNNs). \n\nI-RAZOR functions as a flexible pruning algorithm that not only filters unnecessary features but also derives optimal dimensions, effectively balancing model performance with memory overhead. It introduces a two-stage end-to-end framework that automates feature selection and adaptive dimension assignment, enhancing the interpretability and flexibility of feature engineering processes. \n\nMoreover, I-RAZOR evaluates the importance of each feature in relation to its optimal embedding dimension, thereby facilitating model-consistent feature selection. The algorithm also focuses on optimizing hyperparameters, particularly the threshold cpt and the weight coefficient λ of the regularization term L p, further refining its performance in machine learning models. Overall, I-RAZOR represents a significant advancement in the field of recommender systems, streamlining the screening of new features and guiding iterative feature engineering efforts.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1735731277, "model": "gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_d02d531b47", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 239, "prompt_tokens": 613, "total_tokens": 852, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are an expert in community analysis and machine learning.
