It operates by utilizing a cumulative probability threshold, which helps retain essential information during the retraining phase. This algorithm is particularly notable for its ability to generate fine-grained embedding dimension configurations in neural networks, enabling flexible adjustments of thresholds to accommodate various embedding search methods. Additionally, the CPT-based pruning algorithm is integrated into i-Razor, where it optimizes feature selection and enhances model performance while effectively managing memory usage. Overall, this algorithm plays a crucial role in improving the efficiency and effectiveness of deep learning applications.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1735731284, "model": "gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_0aa8d3e20b", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 124, "prompt_tokens": 343, "total_tokens": 467, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are an expert in community analysis and machine learning.
