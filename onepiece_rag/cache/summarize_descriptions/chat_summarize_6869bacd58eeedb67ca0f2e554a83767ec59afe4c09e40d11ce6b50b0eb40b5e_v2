This algorithm is designed to generate mixed embedding configurations flexibly, optimizing input configurations by reducing unnecessary parameters. It focuses on retaining effective information during the retraining stage, ensuring that the most useful features are preserved while filtering out less relevant fields. By deriving the embedding dimension for each field, the CPT-Based Pruning Algorithm enhances the overall efficiency of the model, allowing for more effective information retention throughout the pruning process.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1735442711, "model": "gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_0aa8d3e20b", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 111, "prompt_tokens": 270, "total_tokens": 381, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
