The formula discusses a sequence of inequalities that are significant for the analysis presented. Additionally, Formula_15 serves as a transformation formula that applies a logarithmic function to a matrix element, a common technique in data normalization. Furthermore, it establishes a constraint within the mathematical model, stating that Kn must be less than or equal to Pn for n values ranging from 1 to 2.
