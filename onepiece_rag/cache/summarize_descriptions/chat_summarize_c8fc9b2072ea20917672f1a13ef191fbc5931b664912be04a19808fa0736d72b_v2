It measures the performance of a model by quantifying how well the predicted probabilities align with the actual outcomes, where predictions are expressed as probability values between 0 and 1. Logloss, also known as binary cross-entropy loss, penalizes false classifications, meaning that lower values indicate better model performance and more accurate predictions.
