This concept is often illustrated using graph theory, where events can be represented through nodes and edges. Specifically, an event refers to a particular occurrence or outcome that can be linked to a set of nodes within a graph, such as the activation of a connection between these nodes. Thus, the notion of an event encompasses both the assignment of probabilities to various outcomes and the representation of these outcomes within a structured graphical framework.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1735731320, "model": "gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_0aa8d3e20b", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 108, "prompt_tokens": 302, "total_tokens": 410, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are an expert in community analysis and machine learning.
