It serves as a foundational model for the development of ùúÖHGCN, which implements graph convolution operations in hyperbolic space. While HGCN effectively leverages hyperbolic geometry, it is noted that it does not incorporate curvature information, which may result in less effective hierarchical learning compared to other models. Additionally, HGCN shares similar computational complexity characteristics with ORC during both training and inference, indicating its efficiency in processing graph data.
