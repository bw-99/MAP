Specifically, it indicates that there are at least k mutually disjoint paths between any pair of nodes, ensuring that the network remains connected even in the event of node failures. This property is crucial for maintaining communication security and resiliency against attacks, as it defines the minimum number of nodes that must be removed to disconnect the remaining nodes. In essence, k-connectivity measures a graph's ability to sustain connectivity despite the removal of up to (k - 1) nodes, highlighting the existence of multiple node-disjoint paths that facilitate uninterrupted communication within the network.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1735731311, "model": "gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_0aa8d3e20b", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 132, "prompt_tokens": 466, "total_tokens": 598, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are an expert in community analysis and machine learning.
