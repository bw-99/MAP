It encompasses methods of data analysis that automate the building of analytical models, allowing for the training of algorithms in various contexts, including sustainability reporting. Specifically, machine learning is utilized to train classifiers for analyzing sustainability reports, employing techniques such as logistic regression and multi-layer perceptron (MLP) models. Additionally, it is recognized as a subset of artificial intelligence that allows computers to perform tasks without explicit instructions, and it is commonly applied in quantitative trading for factor selection. Overall, machine learning represents a significant advancement in the ability of computers to interpret and act on data-driven insights.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1735442610, "model": "gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_0aa8d3e20b", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 145, "prompt_tokens": 306, "total_tokens": 451, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
