It is characterized as a curvature-aware hyperbolic graph convolutional neural network designed to effectively model tree-like datasets. This novel framework leverages discrete Ricci curvature for message passing and adapts global hyperbolic curvature to improve the modeling of tree-like structures.\n\nThe 洧랜HGCN model utilizes curvature to guide message passing, which enhances long-range propagation within networks. It combines both discrete and continuous curvatures to improve tree-like modeling in hyperbolic space, allowing for more effective message passing in nodes with high local graph curvature while weakening it in nodes with low local curvature. This approach results in better performance in link prediction tasks by utilizing a larger embedding space that preserves structural dependencies.\n\nOverall, 洧랜HGCN outperforms traditional Euclidean and hyperbolic models across various graph learning tasks, demonstrating enhanced discriminative power and boundary sharpness between different classes in datasets. It is a specific implementation of hyperbolic graph convolutional networks that aims to improve performance on graph-based tasks, incorporating additional parameters for further enhancement.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1735442735, "model": "gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_d02d531b47", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 245, "prompt_tokens": 486, "total_tokens": 731, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
