It encompasses a computational method formulated as linear programming problems, characterized by a computational complexity that is proportional to the size of the graph and is computed prior to the training process. Additionally, ORC incorporates a curvature-based approach that enhances the generalization ability of models within the realm of graph representation learning. Furthermore, ORC stands for Optimal Resource Consumption, which serves as a measure in the context of node relationships and embedding distances. Collectively, these aspects highlight ORC's significance in optimizing computational efficiency and improving model performance in graph-related tasks.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1735442739, "model": "gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_d02d531b47", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 124, "prompt_tokens": 211, "total_tokens": 335, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
