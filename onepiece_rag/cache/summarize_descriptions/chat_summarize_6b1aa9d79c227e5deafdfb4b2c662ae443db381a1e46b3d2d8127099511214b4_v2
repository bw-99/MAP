It operates as an instance-wise Hierarchical Architecture Search framework, which automates the neural architecture search at the instance level for recommender systems. This innovative approach allows iHAS to tailor embedding dimensions to individual samples, thereby improving overall model performance.\n\nThe framework employs a hierarchical training strategy that optimizes different modules at various stages, effectively addressing the encoding challenges associated with jointly optimizing all modules in machine learning applications. iHAS has demonstrated its superiority by outperforming state-of-the-art baseline methods in deep recommendation systems, achieving higher Area Under the Curve (AUC) scores and lower Logloss metrics on prominent datasets such as Avazu and Criteo. The three-stage hierarchical training process includes searching, clustering, and retraining, which collectively contribute to its effectiveness in identifying optimal embedding dimensions for Deep Learning Recommender Models (DLRMs).", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1735731240, "model": "gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_d02d531b47", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 198, "prompt_tokens": 425, "total_tokens": 623, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are an expert in community analysis and machine learning.
