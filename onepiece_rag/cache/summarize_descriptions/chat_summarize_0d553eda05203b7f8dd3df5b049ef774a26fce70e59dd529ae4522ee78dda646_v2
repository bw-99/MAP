This model demonstrates exceptional transferability across different recommendation models, significantly enhancing performance in real-world recommender systems. iHAS utilizes Bernoulli gates and K-Means clustering to optimize recommendation systems based on training and validation datasets. It has been proposed as a method that outperforms state-of-the-art baseline methods in deep recommendation systems, achieving higher Area Under the Curve (AUC) scores and lower Logloss values. Additionally, iHAS serves as a model for performance comparison against baseline models in machine learning, particularly on the Avazu and Criteo datasets.
