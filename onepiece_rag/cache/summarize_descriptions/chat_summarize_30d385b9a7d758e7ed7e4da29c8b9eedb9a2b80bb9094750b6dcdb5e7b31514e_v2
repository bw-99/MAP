It specifically focuses on utilization-based analyses for sporadic task systems, applicable to both uniprocessor and multiprocessor environments. K2Q provides a general response-time analysis and schedulability-test framework that facilitates the automatic construction of closed-form quadratic bounds or utilization bounds for real-time systems operating under fixed-priority scheduling. This framework is adept at testing the schedulability of task sets by taking into account the utilizations and execution times of higher-priority tasks, making it a versatile tool for various applications in real-time systems.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1735442644, "model": "gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_0aa8d3e20b", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 132, "prompt_tokens": 299, "total_tokens": 431, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
