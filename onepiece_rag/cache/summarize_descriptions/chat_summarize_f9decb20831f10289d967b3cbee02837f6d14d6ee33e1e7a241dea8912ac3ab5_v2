This method focuses on candidate retrieval, utilizing advanced embedding techniques to select relevant items more effectively. By applying nearest-neighbor smoothing, KNN-EMBED enhances the recall of retrieved items in candidate retrieval tasks, leveraging information from neighboring users to better model user preferences. Furthermore, it represents users as a mixture over learned item clusters, which reflects their multiple interests and aims to increase diversity in recommendations. Overall, KNN-EMBED is a proposed algorithm that significantly contributes to the effectiveness and diversity of item retrieval in recommendation systems.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1735891876, "model": "gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_0aa8d3e20b", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 143, "prompt_tokens": 431, "total_tokens": 574, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\r\nYou are an expert in community analysis and machine learning.
