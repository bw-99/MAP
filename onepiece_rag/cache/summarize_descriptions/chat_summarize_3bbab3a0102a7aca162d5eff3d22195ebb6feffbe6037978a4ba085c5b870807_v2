These models are designed to predict user preferences by analyzing a variety of input features. Typically, they incorporate an embedding layer, which transforms categorical data into continuous vector representations, and a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) component, which processes these embeddings to generate personalized recommendations. By utilizing these advanced methodologies, deep recommendation models significantly improve the accuracy and relevance of the recommendations provided to users, making them a crucial element in the development of modern recommendation systems.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1735731245, "model": "gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_d02d531b47", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 112, "prompt_tokens": 305, "total_tokens": 417, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are an expert in community analysis and machine learning.
