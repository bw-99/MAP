They operate using a stochastic selection mode to create embedding masks, which determine the dimensions to include in the model for each individual sample. These instance-wise mechanisms facilitate a tailored dimension search, optimizing the flow of information from embedding tables to multi-layer perceptron (MLP) components. By functioning as switches, Bernoulli gates can operate in both stochastic and deterministic modes, allowing for dynamic control over the selection of embedding representations during the training process. Trained as parameters within the iHAS model, they play a crucial role in improving recommendation performance by ensuring that the most relevant dimensions are utilized for each instance.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1735731241, "model": "gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_0aa8d3e20b", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 149, "prompt_tokens": 418, "total_tokens": 567, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are an expert in community analysis and machine learning.
