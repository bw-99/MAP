These coordinates define specific points or parameters within a mathematical context, making them essential for graphical representation and analysis. Formula coordinates provide the spatial representation of formulas, indicating their position and dimensions, which are crucial for visual contexts. They are typically used in conjunction with the formulas to facilitate calculations and graphical interpretations. Overall, formula coordinates represent the numerical values that define the position and dimensions of elements within a formula, serving as a vital component in both graphical and mathematical applications.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1735442621, "model": "gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_d02d531b47", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 125, "prompt_tokens": 419, "total_tokens": 544, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
