Formula Text serves as the written representation of mathematical relationships, while Formula Coordinates are utilized to define the parameters or variables within these expressions. They work in tandem to provide a comprehensive understanding of the mathematical concepts being presented.\n\nFormula Coordinates are often employed alongside Formula Text to illustrate graphical representations of the mathematical relationships, offering a visual context that enhances comprehension. They help to specify particular values or points relevant to the formulas described in the Formula Text, thereby providing clarity and application for the mathematical expressions.\n\nAdditionally, Formula Coordinates serve to visualize the Formula Text, indicating where the formulas are represented within a document and how the elements are spatially arranged. This spatial representation aids in interpreting the mathematical concepts, making it easier to grasp the relationships and results derived from the formulas.\n\nIn summary, Formula Coordinates and Formula Text are integral to each other, with Formula Coordinates providing essential context, visualization, and specification of parameters that enrich the understanding of the mathematical expressions articulated in the Formula Text.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1735442917, "model": "gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_0aa8d3e20b", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 215, "prompt_tokens": 491, "total_tokens": 706, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
