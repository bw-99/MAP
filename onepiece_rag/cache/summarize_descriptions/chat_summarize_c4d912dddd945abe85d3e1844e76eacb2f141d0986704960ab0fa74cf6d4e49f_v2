It functions as a cross-platform recommender system that automatically identifies and recommends repositories pertinent to specific academic papers, thereby improving the accessibility and relevance of research materials. The framework evaluates the performance of its recommendations by utilizing bridge papers and repositories, ensuring that users receive high-quality suggestions.\n\nAt its core, Paper2Repo employs a recommendation algorithm that encodes both the content and the graph structures of papers and repositories. This innovative approach allows it to learn embeddings that effectively represent the relationships between different entities, enabling it to outperform other recommendation methods across various performance metrics. Overall, Paper2Repo serves as a valuable tool for researchers and academics seeking to navigate the vast landscape of academic literature and associated resources.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1735385105, "model": "gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_0aa8d3e20b", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 162, "prompt_tokens": 247, "total_tokens": 409, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
