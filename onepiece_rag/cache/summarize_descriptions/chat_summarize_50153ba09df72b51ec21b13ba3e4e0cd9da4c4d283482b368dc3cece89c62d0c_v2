This model leverages both discrete curvature 洧랜 and learnable parameters, enabling it to perform effectively in graph-based learning scenarios, particularly in tasks such as node classification and link prediction. \n\nSpecifically, 洧랜HGCN is characterized as a curvature-aware hyperbolic graph network that integrates both discrete and continuous curvatures, which significantly improves tree-like modeling in hyperbolic space. The model focuses on message passing among nodes, guided by local graph curvature, thereby enhancing long-range propagation and interactions among unconnected nodes. \n\nAdditionally, 洧랜HGCN employs an architecture that utilizes layers of Hyperbolic Message Passing (HMP) as an encoder, coupled with the Fermi-Dirac function for decoding in link prediction tasks. This innovative approach allows for a more effective representation of relationships within graph structures, ultimately leading to improved performance in various graph-related applications.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1735731221, "model": "gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_d02d531b47", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 214, "prompt_tokens": 464, "total_tokens": 678, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are an expert in community analysis and machine learning.
