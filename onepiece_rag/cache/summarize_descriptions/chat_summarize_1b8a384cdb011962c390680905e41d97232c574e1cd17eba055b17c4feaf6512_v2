This method integrates user preferences with item clusters, thereby improving the selection of relevant items while ensuring a diverse range of options. Additionally, a mixture of embeddings allows for multiple embeddings for a user, effectively capturing a broader spectrum of interests compared to unimodal embeddings. Overall, this approach aims to optimize the retrieval process by leveraging the strengths of various embedding representations.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1735442774, "model": "gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_0aa8d3e20b", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 93, "prompt_tokens": 207, "total_tokens": 300, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
