It illustrates the proposed Curvature-aware aggregation method discussed in the conference proceedings and is referenced in the document to highlight concepts related to mathematical assertions. Additionally, Figure 4 presents a hyperparameter study of cpt and λ on the Avazu-FG dataset, showcasing a performance comparison for different T values when K is set to 10, thereby emphasizing the impact of T on evaluation metrics. The figure also includes the Precision@k evaluation for different models associated with recommendation algorithms, as well as accuracy and completion time results for four groups of tasks in the experiment. Furthermore, it displays the averaged Mean Absolute Error (MAE) per rating prediction for the iTrace algorithm and characterizes hyperbola in a graphical format. Lastly, Figure 4 features an image plot of artificial rating data before and after normalization, providing a holistic view of the data and methodologies discussed.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1735385084, "model": "gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_d02d531b47", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 196, "prompt_tokens": 326, "total_tokens": 522, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
