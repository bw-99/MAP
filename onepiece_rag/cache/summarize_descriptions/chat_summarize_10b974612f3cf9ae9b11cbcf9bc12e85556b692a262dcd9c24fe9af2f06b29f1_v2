This phenomenon can result in patches that perform well on the training data but fail to generalize effectively to broader scenarios or unseen data. Specifically, overfitting occurs when a model becomes overly complex, capturing noise rather than the underlying patterns, which ultimately leads to poor performance in real-world applications. Furthermore, a patch may pass all test cases yet still lack semantic equivalence to the correct developer patch, highlighting a critical flaw in the patch generation process. This underscores the importance of ensuring that automated repair methods not only meet immediate testing criteria but also maintain robustness and accuracy in diverse contexts.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1735731267, "model": "gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_0aa8d3e20b", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 148, "prompt_tokens": 375, "total_tokens": 523, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are an expert in community analysis and machine learning.
