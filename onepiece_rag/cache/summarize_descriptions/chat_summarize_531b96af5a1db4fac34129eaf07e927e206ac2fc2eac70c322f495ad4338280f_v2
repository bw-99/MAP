It performs dimension search directly on all fields without the need for feature selection, allowing for the evaluation of naive dimension optimization. The method proposes a differentiable search for optimal embedding dimensions by calculating attention coefficients of operators related to candidate dimensions. Specifically, AutoDim is particularly effective in the context of recommender systems, where it focuses on field-aware embedding dimension searching. This approach aims to optimize the representation of features within the model, ultimately enhancing the performance of recommendation algorithms.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1735442617, "model": "gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_d02d531b47", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 113, "prompt_tokens": 254, "total_tokens": 367, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
