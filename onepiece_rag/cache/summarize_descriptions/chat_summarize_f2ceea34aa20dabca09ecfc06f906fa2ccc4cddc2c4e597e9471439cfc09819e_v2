It applies nearest-neighbor smoothing to improve item retrieval by utilizing information from nearest neighbors, which in turn increases the diversity of recommendations. The method has been evaluated on various aspects, including recall, diversity, and goodness of fit for candidate retrieval strategies. KNN-Embed represents users as a smoothed mixture over learned item clusters, effectively capturing distinct interests and improving the modeling of user preferences. By transforming single user dense embeddings into mixtures of embeddings, KNN-Embed aims to boost both retrieval recall and diversity, making it a valuable technique for candidate retrieval in recommendation systems.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1735442773, "model": "gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_d02d531b47", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 134, "prompt_tokens": 296, "total_tokens": 430, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
