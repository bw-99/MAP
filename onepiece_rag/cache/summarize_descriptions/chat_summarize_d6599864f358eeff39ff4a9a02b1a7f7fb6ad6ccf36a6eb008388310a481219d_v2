It employs a gating mechanism to effectively identify and mask irrelevant or useless features, thereby enhancing the model's performance. Additionally, AutoFIS facilitates automatic selection of feature interactions, streamlining the process of identifying significant relationships between features. This dual functionality makes AutoFIS a valuable tool for improving the efficiency and accuracy of machine learning models.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1735385086, "model": "gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_d02d531b47", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 92, "prompt_tokens": 171, "total_tokens": 263, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
