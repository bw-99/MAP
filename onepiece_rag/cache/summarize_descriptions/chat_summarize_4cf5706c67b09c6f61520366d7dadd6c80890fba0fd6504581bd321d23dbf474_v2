It serves as a differentiable neural input razor, specifically aimed at optimizing input configuration for improved model performance and parameter efficiency. The framework focuses on automatic feature selection and adaptive dimension assignment, utilizing techniques such as dimension search and a CPT-based pruning algorithm to prune unnecessary fields and assign adaptive embedding dimensions.\n\nI-RAZOR is particularly effective in advertising prediction tasks, where it leverages hyperparameters, such as cpt and λ, to control the number of parameters in machine learning models. By optimizing feature selection and dimension search, I-RAZOR improves flexibility and interpretability in feature engineering, making it a valuable tool for real-world applications in deep learning. Overall, I-RAZOR represents a two-stage end-to-end solution that enhances the performance of DNN-based recommender systems through its innovative approach to input optimization.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1735385085, "model": "gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_d02d531b47", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 196, "prompt_tokens": 373, "total_tokens": 569, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
