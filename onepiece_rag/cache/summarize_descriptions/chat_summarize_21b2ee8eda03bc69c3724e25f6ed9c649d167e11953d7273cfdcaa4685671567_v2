It characterizes hyperbola in the context of multiobjective evolutionary algorithms, contributing to the broader comprehension of these optimization methods. Additionally, Figure 4 depicts a hyperparameter study focusing on the parameters cpt and λ within the Avazu-FG dataset, analyzing their impact on model performance. It also illustrates the inference time of the iHAS model alongside other baseline models on the Avazu dataset, offering insights into the performance efficiency of iHAS.\n\nFurthermore, Figure 4 presents the averaged Mean Absolute Error (MAE) per rating prediction, shedding light on the accuracy of the rating predictions made by the iTrace algorithm. Lastly, it provides a visual representation of financial factors pertinent to selected stocks and time periods, emphasizing the contribution measures of each factor. Overall, Figure 4 integrates various analytical dimensions, from optimization techniques to financial analysis, thereby enriching the understanding of the underlying data and models.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1735442618, "model": "gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_0aa8d3e20b", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 203, "prompt_tokens": 303, "total_tokens": 506, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
