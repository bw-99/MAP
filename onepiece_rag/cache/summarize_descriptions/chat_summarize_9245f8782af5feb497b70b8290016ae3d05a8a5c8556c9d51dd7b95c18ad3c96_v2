It specifically describes the empirical cumulative distribution function (ECDF) and its connection to the reference Gaussian distribution. Additionally, Formula_18 addresses the probability of a graph being k-connected as the number of nodes (n) approaches infinity, which is dependent on the behavior of αn. Furthermore, it outlines a critical mathematical relationship that underpins the conclusions presented in the associated document. Lastly, Formula_18 includes a probabilistic condition that quantifies scenarios where none of the nodes in a specified set are connected, providing a mathematical expression to represent this condition.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1735442640, "model": "gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_0aa8d3e20b", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 127, "prompt_tokens": 241, "total_tokens": 368, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
