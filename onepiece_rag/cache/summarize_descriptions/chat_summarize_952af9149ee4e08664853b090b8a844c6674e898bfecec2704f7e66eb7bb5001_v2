Specifically, it states that if the minimum node degree of a graph is no less than k, then the graph is guaranteed to be k-connected. Additionally, Formula 64 includes a mathematical expression that involves the variables k and U, emphasizing certain conditions that pertain to the graph's structure and properties.
