This process allows traders and analysts to evaluate how a strategy would have performed in the past, thereby providing insights into its potential effectiveness in real-time trading scenarios. By comparing predicted returns against actual returns over a historical period, backtesting helps in determining the reliability and robustness of trading strategies before they are implemented in live markets.
