In the i-Razor framework, this stage involves executing a pruning algorithm designed to eliminate redundant fields while retaining essential embedding dimensions based on their relative weights. This process ensures that the model is refined and optimized for better performance. Similarly, in the iHAS framework, the retraining stage focuses on developing cluster-customized deep learning recommendation models (DLRMs) by averaging embedding masks across different clusters to finalize the embedding dimensions. Overall, the retraining stage serves as a pivotal moment in the machine learning process, where models are retrained using a carefully curated set of features and parameters, enhancing their effectiveness and accuracy.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1735731246, "model": "gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_0aa8d3e20b", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 149, "prompt_tokens": 372, "total_tokens": 521, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are an expert in community analysis and machine learning.
