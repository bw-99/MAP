These parameters play a crucial role in shaping the training of models, as they directly influence various aspects of the learning algorithm. For instance, in the context of i-Razor, hyperparameters include values such as the threshold cpt and the weight coefficient λ, which are essential for guiding the model's performance and effectiveness. Overall, hyperparameters are fundamental to the model training process, as they help determine how well a machine learning model will learn from data.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1735731283, "model": "gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_d02d531b47", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 118, "prompt_tokens": 299, "total_tokens": 417, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are an expert in community analysis and machine learning.
