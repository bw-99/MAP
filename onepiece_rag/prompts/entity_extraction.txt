Figure 1: sc-OTGM represented as a generative graphical model.
We define the complete generative model for sc-OTGM as illustrated in Figure 1. Let X proj denote the gene expression matrix, with rows representing individual cells and columns representing features in a reduced-dimensional space. The gene expression profile of cell i is X proj, i . π represents the cluster probabilities. Each π k , where k specifies a particular cell state, indicates the prior probability of the k-th component in the mixture, subject to k π k = 1. The latent variable z i ∈ R K determining the component generating each data point x proj, i , is one-hot encoded and follows a categorical distribution parameterized by π. For each Gaussian component in the mixture model, µ k b ∈ R m and Σ k b ∈ R m×m define the mean and covariance matrix for unperturbed cells of a specific cell type, respectively. We specify perturbations and heterogeneous cellular responses as multivariate Gaussiandistributed variables e ∼ N (µ ke , Σ ke ) and h ∼ N (µ km , Σ km ), respectively. We model perturbation as a dynamic system, where the cell outputs an impulse response function h, when presented with a brief perturbation signal e. The convolution of these variables represents the combined effect on the latent state z pi , which is also distributed as a multivariate Gaussian:
z pi = (e k * h k )(z) = +∞ -∞ e k (τ )h k (z-τ )dτ ∼ N (µ ke +µ km , Σ ke +Σ km ) ∼ N (µ kp , Σ kp ),(1)
In the proposed generative mixture model, the joint probability distribution for observed data X, and latent variables Z i , E, and H conditioned on π, µ, Σ is formulated as:
p(X, Z i , E, H | π, µ, Σ) = N i=1 p(z i |π)p(x proj,i |z i , µ, Σ) N i=1 e * h (2) = N i=1 K k=1 π z ik k N (w bi ; µ k b , Σ k b ) z ik N (w pi ; µ kp , Σ kp ) ,(3)
where Z ∈ {0, 1} N ×K denotes latent class indicators for N cells across K cell states, E ∈ R N ×m captures perturbation effects, and H ∈ R N ×m represents the cellular responses to these perturbations. Each datum w bi , w pi ∈ R m is drawn independently and identically distributed (i.i.d.) from their respective marginal PDFs. To prevent numerical instability due to arithmetic underflow or overflow during likelihood calculations in the E-step of the Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm, we use the log-sum-exp trick. This method transforms the product of Gaussian probabilities into a sum, ensuring more stable computations. Let L denote p(X,
Z i , E, H | π, µ, Σ): log L = N i=1 K k=1 z ik log π k + z ik log N (w bi ; µ k b , Σ k b ) + log N (w pi ; µ kp , Σ kp )(4)
The Maximum-a-Posteriori (MAP) parameter updates for the GMM via the EM algorithm are detailed in Algorithm 3. To address numerical instability in Σ's inversion due to its near singularity or nonpositive semi-definiteness, Tikhonov regularization is applied Alberti et al. (2021). See Appendix A.6 for additional details. </p><h2>publication_ref</h2> <p>['b26', 'b30', 'b1'] </p><h2>figure_ref</h2> <p>[] </p><h2>table_ref</h2> <p>['tab_1'] </p><h2>heading</h2> <p>PLANNING OPTIMAL TRANSPORT VIA HIT-AND-RUN MARKOV CHAIN SAMPLER </p><h2>text</h2> <p>OT problems, central to measuring the cost of optimally transporting mass from one distribution to another, are traditionally solved via the Monge (1781) and Kantorovich (1942) formulations, which, however, scale poorly for large datasets due to their reliance on linear programming (LP) Bunne et al. (2023). A breakthrough by Cuturi (2013) introduces entropic regularization into OT, resulting in the Sinkhorn algorithm, which significantly reduces computational complexity, enabling efficient largescale applications. This methodological advancement, detailed in Section A.2.3, represents a pivotal shift towards practical OT computation in machine learning. While OT is conventionally represented by a scalar value indicating the minimum cost required for such transport under specific constraints, sc-OTGM conceptualizes OT as a distribution to focus on the distribution of transportation costs and paths rather than summarizing these costs into a single scalar. A distribution-based approach encapsulates more information about the transport process, such as the variance of transport costs, providing not just the minimum cost but also how costs are distributed across different transport paths. Additionally, it provides a more robust measure of similarity between distributions, as it does not collapse the transport problem into a single metric but rather considers the entire cost landscape, potentially mitigating the influence of outliers.
We model the latent states of unperturbed and perturbed cells as Gaussian distributions, with unperturbed cells described by X = N (µ k b , Σ k b ) and perturbed cells by Y = N (µ ky , Σ ky ). MAP estimates for µ k b , Σ k b , µ ky , Σ ky were derived using the EM Algorithm within a GMM framework.
To quantify the perturbation effect, we introduce a distribution, Z = N (µ kp , Σ kp ), resulting from the linear displacement between X and Y . Specifically, Z is characterized by
µ kp = µ ky -µ k b and Σ kp = Σ k b + Σ ky -2Σ cross .
Z captures the OT cost distribution required to transition between these states. The coupling (joint distribution) of X and Y is unknown, therefore we approximate Σ cross via Hit-and-Run Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC). This generates a Markov chain that, in its stable state, converges to the uniform distribution over a convex polytope van Valkenhoef & Tervonen (2015), and under certain regularity conditions, converges in distribution to the target distribution Smith (1996). The steps to compute Σ cross are elaborated in Algorithm 1. For recursive updates of Σ cross we use follow-the-leader (FTL) strategy which is prominently used in online density estimation and active learning Azoury & Warmuth (2001); Dasgupta & Hsu (2007). Details on the implementation and synthetic data experiments are provided in the Appendix A.8.
sc-OTGM samples transportation paths (vectors) directly from the OT landscape, rooted in the perturbation distribution Z, within a dimensionally reduced subspace: x path ∼ N (µ kp , Σ kp ), which effectively captures the essence of gene expression dynamics under perturbation. The high-dimensional gene expression profiles corresponding to these paths are reconstructed via inverse PCA, expressed as:
x ′′ path = x path V T m
, where V m represents the matrix comprising the top m eigenvectors derived from the covariance matrix of the pre-processed gene expression data. See Appendix A.4 and A.5 for more details. For each gene expression profile within the OT landscape, we derive a parametric representation, as follows:
µ gene,i = the i th element of (µ kp V T m ) and σ 2 gene,i = the i th diagonal entry of (V m Σ kp V T m ),
where µ gene,i denotes the degree of change in a gene's expression in response to perturbation, indicating potential activation or suppression of the gene. σ gene,i quantifies the confidence in these expression changes, providing insights into the variability of our computations. While biological systems are often complex and nonlinear, under specific conditions or within certain ranges, linear approximations can provide valuable insights and simplify modeling efforts. van Someren et al. (2000) presents a methodology for modeling genetic networks that employs clustering to tackle the dimensionality problem and a linear model to infer the regulatory interactions. By analyzing the covariance matrix Σ kp of the perturbation distribution, we can explore the interconnected behavior between genes, examining how they co-vary or influence each other. Consider the scenario where the expression level of gene i changes, denoted as ∆X i . The covariance matrix Σ kp , upon transformation via V m , becomes
Σ ′′ kp = V m Σ kp V T m .
The expected change in gene j's expression level, ∆X j , resulting from a change in gene i, is linearly approximated as follows:
∆X j = Σ ′′ kp,ij Σ ′′ kp,ii ∆X i (5)

On the first day, students recorded their interactions with Alexa, impressions of the CA, and demographics information. At the start of the second day, students completed a questionnaire assessing their initial feeling towards and understanding of Alexa, AI and conversational AI. The questions were divided into two sets, which we refer to as the Persona and Conception questions.
The Persona questions assessed students' sentiments about Alexa on a 7-point Likert scale. The questions stated, "Alexa is..." followed by "intelligent", "friendly", "alive", "safe", "trustworthy", "human-like", and "smarter than me". The final Persona question asked how close students felt to Alexa using the Inclusion of the Other in the Self scale [18]. The Conception questions assessed students' understanding of AI and conversational AI through asking, "Describe in your own words what AI is" and "Describe in your own words what conversational AI is (e.g., chatbots, like Alexa or Google home, use conversational AI)". At the end of the final day, students completed the Persona and Conception questions again. Additional questionnaires were given at the end of the second, third, and fourth days to assess specific AI literacy competencies, as discussed and analyzed in [59]. </p><h2>publication_ref</h2> <p>['b13', 'b33', 'b17', 'b58'] </p><h2>figure_ref</h2> <p>[] </p><h2>table_ref</h2> <p>[] </p><h2>heading</h2> <p>Data Analysis </p><h2>text</h2> <p>This study builds on the study presented in [59]. Thus, certain data analyzed in this study (e.g., demographics) is necessarily the same; however, this study focuses on data not analyzed in [59], including the questionnaire responses to the Persona questions and students' reported interactions with Alexa. The responses to the Conception questions were analyzed in both studies, however using different methods and through different lenses. This study investigates students' conceptions of AI through a word frequency analysis as well as analyses of changes in number of tags (as described below). The study in [59] assessed students' AI literacy before and after the learning intervention.
To investigate the responses to qualitative questions, a reflexive, open-coding approach to thematic analysis [7] was performed by three researchers. The three researchers independently completed familiarization and code-generation stages. After several discussions, the three researchers came to a consensus on codes for the questionnaire responses. Codes and respective representative quotations can be found in [58]. Researchers generally constructed codes inductively or with respect to ideas from literature, including the Big AI Ideas [56]. It is important to note that responses often involved multiple ideas and were thus tagged with more than one code.
For the quantitative questions (e.g., Likert scale Persona questions) asked on both pre-and postquestionnaires, the Wilcoxon Signed-Rank Test was employed to measure changes. Additionally, we used the Kendall Tau method to create pairwise correlation matrices. We analyzed the correlation coefficients using Cohen (2013)'s definition for correlation effect strength for behavioral and education psychology [8]. To test the validity of the strength of the coefficients, we compared Kendall Tau p-values to an alpha of 0.05. For the word frequency analysis, we used the NLTK library [33] to remove stop-words, tokenize and lemmatize qualitative responses. Additionally, to better visualize non-obvious concepts, we filtered out words directly from the questions, including 'AI', 'artificial', 'intelligence', and 'conversational'. Word clouds were generated using [39]. </p><h2>publication_ref</h2> <p>['b58', 'b58', 'b58', 'b6', 'b57', 'b55', 'b7', 'b32', 'b38'] </p><h2>figure_ref</h2> <p>[] </p><h2>table_ref</h2> <p>[] </p><h2>heading</h2> <p>RESULTS </p><h2>text</h2> <p> </p><h2>publication_ref</h2> <p>[] </p><h2>figure_ref</h2> <p>[] </p><h2>table_ref</h2> <p>[] </p><h2>heading</h2> <p>Student interactions with Alexa </p><h2>text</h2> <p>To understand the types of interactions students had with Alexa prior to the intervention, we coded the phrases they reported saying to Alexa during the interaction activity. We found most of the phrases fell into one of five categories listed in Tab. 1. The Information Updates category involved real-time events; the Action Commands category involved built-in Alexa applications; the Personal Questions category involved questions about Alexa; the Jokes category involved asking Alexa to say a joke; and the Other category involved questions and phrases that were often humorous (e.g., "Are dragons real?") or impossible to fully answer (e.g., "What are all the numbers of pi?"), or generally fell outside of the other categories (e.g., "Hello"). Note that prior to the activity, we asked Alexa to tell us a joke, which may have contributed to a large number of students also asking Alexa for jokes. </p><h2>publication_ref</h2> <p>[] </p><h2>figure_ref</h2> <p>[] </p><h2>table_ref</h2> <p>[] </p><h2>heading</h2> <p>Perceptions of Alexa pre-and post-workshop </p><h2>text</h2> <p>By comparing pre-and post-survey answers to the Persona questions (see Fig. 2), we found significant differences in how students felt about Alexa's intelligence and how close they felt they were to Alexa. After the intervention, students felt Alexa was more intelligent ( x = 6.0, 𝑀𝑜 = 6, |𝑍 | = 2.78, 𝑝 = 0.003) and felt closer to Alexa ( x = 3.5, 𝑀𝑜 = 4, |𝑍 | = 2.75, 𝑝 = 0.003). We did not find any evidence of significant differences in how students felt about Alexa being friendly, alive, safe, trustworthy, human-like or smarter than themselves before and after the intervention.
Prior to the intervention, students generally reported Alexa as being highly intelligent ( x = 5.6, 𝑀𝑜 = 6), highly friendly ( x = 6.0, 𝑀𝑜 = 7), not very alive ( x = 2.9, 𝑀𝑜 = 1), highly safe ( x = 5.4, 𝑀𝑜 = 6), moderately to highly trustworthy ( x = 5.3, 𝑀𝑜 = 4, 5), and moderately human-like ( x = 4.2, 𝑀𝑜 = 5). They also reported feeling Alexa was much smarter than themselves ( x = 6.1, 𝑀𝑜 = 7), and feeling not particularly close to Alexa ( x = 3.0, 𝑀𝑜 = 2). The results were similar after the intervention (other than the changes in intelligence and closeness described above). </p><h2>publication_ref</h2> <p>[] </p><h2>figure_ref</h2> <p>['fig_0'] </p><h2>table_ref</h2> <p>[] </p><h2>heading</h2> <p>Correlations between perceptions of Alexa </p><h2>text</h2> <p>We found strong (𝑟 ≥ 0.5 [8]) correlations between student reports of Alexa's safeness and trustworthiness on both the pre-and post-test, as well as between Alexa's friendliness and trustworthiness on the post-test. There was also a strong correlation between trustworthiness reported on the pre-test and safeness reported on the post-test. Student reports of Alexa's friendliness and trustworthiness on the pre-test and between the pre-and post-tests were moderately (𝑟 ≥ 0.3 [8]) correlated.
Other moderate correlations included student reports of Alexa's intelligence and trustworthiness, friendliness and safeness, trustworthiness and feelings of closeness, human-likeness and aliveness, human-likeness and feelings of closeness, as well as aliveness and feelings of closeness. In the post-test, student reports of Alexa's intelligence and feeling Alexa was smarter than them, as well as Alexa's trustworthiness and feeling Alexa was smarter than them were moderately correlated. Additionally, there was a moderate correlation between students with more experience
