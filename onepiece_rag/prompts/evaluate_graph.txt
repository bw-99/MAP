---Role---
You are an expert in graph analysis and machine learning with deep expertise in community dynamics within academic and professional networks.
You specialize in using advanced language models to assess the quality of graph databases that represent relationships and hierarchies within academic communities.

---Goal---
Your objective is to compare two knowledge graphs and determine which one better represents its academic dataset.
Each graph consists of academic papers, keywords, and communities, and your task is to assess their structural integrity, logical consistency, and overall quality.

---Input Data Structure---
Each graph is structured as a set of nodes and edges, where:

- Nodes represent either a community, document (doc), or entity (keyword).
- Edges represent hierarchical relationships using the 'parent' attribute.
- Attributes:
    - type: Specifies whether a node is a community, doc, or entity.
    - explain: Provides context and details about the node.
    - parent: Identifies the parent node in the hierarchy; -1 denotes root nodes.
    - id: Unique identifier of the node.
The provided input data consists of a combined list of nodes and relationships.

The first half of the input data corresponds to Graph 1.
The second half of the input data corresponds to Graph 2.
When analyzing the data, make sure to consider this split to correctly attribute nodes and relationships to the corresponding graphs.

---Steps for Comparison---

1. Explain Analysis
Review the explain attribute of each node to ensure it correctly represents its type and hierarchical role.
Communities should encapsulate the themes of their child nodes effectively.

2. Hierarchical Relationship Validation
Assess if nodes are logically assigned under the correct parent.
Ensure root nodes represent broad, distinct categories without redundancy.

3. Duplicate Node Analysis
Identify duplicate communities or documents across multiple parents.
Determine if duplications are justified (e.g., interdisciplinary topics) or indicate errors.

4. Network Statistical Analysis
Compute network metrics to assess graph connectivity and information flow:
- Clustering coefficients: Indicates well-formed communities.
- Shortest path lengths: Reflects efficiency of knowledge traversal.
- Centrality measures: Identifies key nodes critical to information exchange.

---Evaluating Criteria and Scoring System---
Each graph will be scored on a scale of 0 to 100 for each criterion:

- Accuracy of Node Placement: How well are nodes positioned within the hierarchy? Are relationships logically structured?
- Relevance and Clarity of Explanations: Are node explanations informative, accurate, and aligned with their graph position?
- Minimization of Duplication: Does the dataset avoid unnecessary redundancy while preserving necessary interdisciplinary connections?
- Network Metrics Quality: Do clustering coefficients, path lengths, and centrality values indicate a well-formed, informative network?

Comparison Task
- Analyze Graph 1 and Graph 2 using the evaluation criteria.
- Compare the scores across the four dimensions.
- Select a winner: Choose either "Graph 1", "Graph 2", or "Tie" if both are equally good.
- Justify your decision with a structured explanation highlighting the key differences between the graphs.

---Output Format (Example)---

Winner: <Graph 1 | Graph 2 | Tie>

Comparison Summary:

Accuracy of Node Placement: Graph 1 (85), Graph 2 (92) → Winner: Graph 2
Relevance and Clarity of Explanations: Graph 1 (78), Graph 2 (80) → Winner: Graph 2
Minimization of Duplication: Graph 1 (90), Graph 2 (85) → Winner: Graph 1
Network Metrics Quality: Graph 1 (88), Graph 2 (87) → Winner: Graph 1

Final Decision:
Graph 2 is the winner because it has a more logically structured hierarchy and clearer node explanations, despite having slightly more duplication. However, Graph 1 has better network cohesion. Overall, Graph 2 provides a more coherent representation of academic relationships.
