Many techniques aim to solve this issue by feature selection or embedding dimension search. However, these techniques typically select a fixed subset of features or embedding dimensions for all instances and feed all instances into one recommender model without considering heterogeneity between items or users. This paper proposes a novel instance-wise Hierarchical Architecture Search framework, iHAS, which automates neural architecture search at the instance level. Specifically, iHAS incorporates three stages: searching, clustering, and retraining. The searching stage identifies optimal instance-wise embedding dimensions across different field features via carefully designed Bernoulli gates with stochastic selection and regularizers. After obtaining these dimensions, the clustering stage divides samples into distinct groups via a deterministic selection approach of Bernoulli gates. The retraining stage then constructs different recommender models, each one designed with optimal dimensions for the corresponding group. We conduct extensive experiments to evaluate the proposed iHAS on two public benchmark datasets from a real-world recommender system. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of iHAS and its outstanding transferability to widely-used deep recommendation models.", "sections": [{"heading": "INTRODUCTION", "text": "Recommender systems, which aim to predict the preference of users, have been widely deployed in various real-world scenarios, e.g., online advertising [3,27], social media [9], news apps [39], etc. Deep learning recommendation models (DLRMs) typically take a large amount of categorical (e.g., gender) or numerical (e.g., age) field features as input. These features are first encoded into highdimensional sparse one-hot vectors, which are later mapped into real-valued dense vectors via embedding tables. The recommender model then feeds these embeddings into a feature interaction layer which usually consists of deep neural network (DNN) [6] or factorization machine (FM) [8,14,26,34] to model user preferences for final prediction.\nThe embedding tables play a fundamental role in the recommendation system, as they dominate the majority of parameters. However, most existing methods construct their proposed recommender models with large-sized embedding tables and a uniform dimension size for all possible fields [8,10,29], which may lead to overfitting, high computational cost, and poor model generalization [15,25,33]. Therefore, the first objective for an optimal DLRM is to find optimal embedding dimensions for different fields and remove redundant dimensions. Performing embedding dimension search is also sufficient to include feature selection, i.e., the optimal dimension for a field feature could be zero, which means completely excluding this feature.\nA common approach for embedding dimension search is to employ the l 0 norm on the dimensions to penalize the count of nonzero dimension entries. However, as the l 0 norm poses a computational challenge for gradient descent, researchers have attempted to substitute l 0 with a surrogate function, such as the l 1 norm for LASSO [32], yet achieving limited selection ability [35]. Recently, probabilistic approaches [18,33] suggest utilizing Bernoulli random variables (RVs) with Gumbel-Softmax approximations to identify the top \ud835\udc3e features with the highest probabilities. Though these methods can be applied for dimension selection, we have empirically observed that the probabilities learned are often indistinguishable. Therefore, selecting the top \ud835\udc3e features/dimensions based on these probabilities may inadvertently result in either the exclusion of critical features/dimensions or the inclusion of irrelevant ones.\nFurthermore, prior approaches uniformly apply embedding dimension selection across all instances in the datasets, therefore disregarding the inherent variations between individual samples. This one-size-for-all approach can be inadequate in many scenarios, especially when dealing with highly heterogeneous populations where relevant features can significantly diverge across users or across items. For example, in a movie recommendation system, the feature \"age\" usually plays a crucial role in recommending Disney movies, thereby possibly necessitating a larger embedding dimension. Conversely, \"age\" is less relevant for comedy films, resulting in a smaller dimension size. Thus, it is evident that treating all instances identically may overlook these context-specific nuances. Intuitively speaking, when dimension selection is performed at the instance level, we can create neural architectures that are better suited to individual samples. Such an approach not only results in superior performance but also enables faster inference times by focusing on the most relevant dimensions of each sample.\nIn this paper, we propose an instance-wise Hierarchical Architecture Search framework, iHAS, which attempts to perform automatic architecture search on the instance level, using hierarchical training procedures for DLRMs. Specifically, iHAS includes three learning stages: searching, clustering, and retraining. The searching stage aims to find the optimal instance-wise embedding dimensions across different fields via a carefully designed \"Bernoulli gate\" with stochastic selection mode and a regularizer. After selecting instancewise embedding dimensions, we separate samples into different groups based on a novel deterministic selection approach in the clustering stage. The retraining stage trains different recommender models, with optimal dimensions tailored to different groups. During inference time, each test sample will first be assigned to a suitable group, where predictions are made by the corresponding recommender model. We summarize our major contributions as:\n\u2022 We propose a hierarchical training framework that uses instance-wise \"Bernoulli gates\" to facilitate effective dimension search for each sample. \u2022 We apply a sparse and bi-polarization regularizer in the objective function to help the model learn distinguishable Bernoulli RVs, and use a threshold selector for downstream deterministic selection. \u2022 To balance the trade-off between the one-size-for-all and full-customization (which is not applicable with finite data size) strategies, we propose to divide samples into clusters and develop tailored recommender models for each cluster.\nWe empirically evaluate the performance of our framework on two large-scale benchmark datasets. Our experimental results indicate a notable superiority of our approach over various state-of-the-art baseline models on both datasets. Furthermore, the transferability analysis demonstrates our framework can be effectively transferred to diverse deep recommender models, thereby enhancing their performance. Additionally, our framework offers an efficiency advantage as it requires less inference time than competing baseline models.", "publication_ref": ["b2", "b26", "b8", "b38", "b5", "b7", "b13", "b25", "b33", "b7", "b9", "b28", "b14", "b24", "b32", "b31", "b34", "b17", "b32"], "figure_ref": [], "table_ref": []}, {"heading": "RELATED WORK", "text": "This section introduces the main related works to our study, focusing on feature-based recommender models and AutoML approaches for recommendation systems.", "publication_ref": [], "figure_ref": [], "table_ref": []}, {"heading": "Feature-based Recommender Models", "text": "Feature-based recommender models take sparse, high-dimensional features from users and items as input and transform them into low-dimensional representations to capture user preferences for improved recommendations.

The research directions include feature selection [15,33], embedding dimension search [37,38], model architecture search [5], and other component search [30,31,36]. Feature selection involves selecting a subset of field features in recommendation systems. For example, AutoField [33] uses a simple controller based on differentiable architecture search [16] to select the top \ud835\udc3e field features. AdaFS [15] enhances AutoField by modifying the controller to assign feature weights to fields for different samples. The objective of embedding dimension search is to find mixed embedding sizes for each field. For example, AutoEmb [38] finds the optimal dimension for each feature using differentiable search [16]. AutoDim [37] selects the best dimension for each field from a group of candidate dimensions in the same way as AutoEmb. Model architecture search explores various network architectures and selects the optimal one [5].\nOur method is in alignment with embedding dimension search. All instances in the above methods share a uniform dimension size for each field. In contrast, our approach adaptively selects dimensions for each instance via the proposed Bernoulli gates, thereby considering the difference between individuals. Moreover, we introduce a polarization regularizer to overcome the shortcomings of the commonly-used top \ud835\udc3e selection strategy.

It involves three principal modules: deep recommendation models (consisting of an embedding layer and an MLP component) for predicting user preferences, a Bernoulli gates layer responsible for dimension selection, and a K-means cluster algorithm that partitions the heterogeneous data.\nIn the searching stage, the key objective is to identify the optimal, instance-wise embedding dimensions across different fields, thus facilitating an accurate recommendation prediction. As shown in Figure 1, the categorical field features are directed to an embedding layer to generate embedding representations. These representations are then processed through the Bernoulli gates to produce embedding masks using a stochastic selection mode (see Section 3.3.1). Each embedding mask comprises a binary vector that serves as a gate on whether the corresponding dimension should be incorporated into the downstream architecture. Then the framework conducts an element-wise multiplication between a sample's embedding representations and embedding masks. This resultant masked embedding representation is then directed to the base MLP component to predict user preference.\nIn the clustering stage, the main objective is to utilize K-Means algorithm [28] to cluster samples into groups. This stage mostly mirrors the procedure used in the searching stage: using the embedding layer and Bernoulli gates (but using deterministic selection mode, see Section 3.3.2) to calculate the masked embedding representations. These masked embedding representations are then used to train a mini-batch K-Means cluster [28]. As shown in Figure 1, the K-means separates the red and yellow samples from the blue and green samples.\nThe retraining stage aims to develop cluster-customized DLRMs, considering the variation in dimension patterns across different clusters. In each cluster, we calculate the embedding masks (using deterministic selection mode) for all samples. The resultant masks are then averaged to obtain one vector, which is used to determine the final embedding dimensions of each DLRM.", "publication_ref": ["b27", "b27"], "figure_ref": ["fig_0", "fig_0"], "table_ref": []}, {"heading": "Deep Learning Recommender Models", "text": "In this subsection, we provide a brief introduction to the basic architecture of the DLRM.

The term |\ud835\udc5b| denotes the number of unique values for \ud835\udc5b-th categorical field. For instance, a categorical field such as \"gender\" with unique valuesmale, female, and unknown -can be expressed through three-bit vectors [1, 0, 0], [0, 1, 0], and [0, 0, 1], respectively.\nTo process a numerical field feature, we will discretize it through custom-width binning, followed by applying a one-hot operation.\nThen, the operation of the embedding layer can be represented as:\n\ud835\udc86 \ud835\udc56,\ud835\udc5b = \ud835\udc97 \ud835\udc5b \ud835\udc99 \ud835\udc56,\ud835\udc5b ,\nwhere\n\ud835\udc97 \ud835\udc5b \u2208 R \ud835\udc51 \u00d7 |\ud835\udc5b |\nis the embedding table of the \ud835\udc5b-th field, \ud835\udc51 is the predefined embedding dimension (typically consistent across all fields), and \ud835\udc86 \ud835\udc56,\ud835\udc5b is the low-dimensional embedding representation.

Analogous to the l 0 norm, we hope these \"switches\" to be capable of fully opening or closing without compromising the information integrity (shrinking the embedding representation). Inspired by the approach presented in [18,35], we use Bernoulli gates to predict each sample's relevant dimensions given its embedding representation. The detailed process of the Bernoulli gates is graphically depicted in Figure 2.\nThe Bernoulli gates operate in two distinct modes: stochastic selection and deterministic selection. Under the stochastic selection mode, the gates operate as independent Bernoulli distributions, to independently \"open\" or \"close\" dimensions given the probabilities. The principle behind stochastic selection rests on the assumption that, given a sufficiently large number of training iterations, the gates will stochastically and comprehensively traverse all potential combinations of dimensions. This prompts the Bernoulli parameters to increase for beneficial dimensions and penalize unhelpful ones. Once the Bernoulli distributions (gates) have been fully explored, we capitalize on the learned distribution by deterministically opening the most advantageous dimensions in the deterministic selection mode. However, learned Bernoulli probabilities often exhibit heavy-tailedness, making it challenging to distinguish between important and unimportant dimensions. To mitigate this, we suggest employing a polarization regularizer and an automatic threshold searcher (both discussed in Section 3.3.3) inside Bernoulli gates.", "publication_ref": ["b17", "b34"], "figure_ref": ["fig_1"], "table_ref": []}, {"heading": "Stochastic Selection.", "text": "In our previous discussion, we aim for Bernoulli gates to function as independent Bernoulli distributions in the stochastic selection mode during the searching stage. The first objective is to encode the embedding representations to the desired independent Bernoulli probabilities. To this end, we employ an FC layer (with parameter \ud835\udc98) and a Sigmoid activation layer (\ud835\udf0e) to project these embedding representations of the \ud835\udc56-th sample onto Bernoulli probabilities (upper left of Figure 2), denoted by {\ud835\udc5d \ud835\udc56,\ud835\udc57 } \ud835\udc41 * \ud835\udc57=1 = \ud835\udf0e (\ud835\udc98 \ud835\udc6c \ud835\udc56 ), where \ud835\udc41 * = \ud835\udc41 \u00d7 \ud835\udc51 is the total length of the embedding representations. This enables us to initiate a combinatorial search process over the space of Bernoulli probabilities and FC parameters. However, optimizing a loss function, which includes discrete RVs (Bernoulli distributions), incurs high variance [23]. To overcome this obstacle, we adopt Gumbel-Softmax [11] (aka Concrete distribution [21]), which offers a viable continuous approximation to the Bernoulli distribution, as visualized in Figure 2 (right).\nRecall that Gumbel-Max [7,22] is an effective method for drawing samples from a Bernoulli distribution (or any type of discrete random variables), as long as we provide the class probabilities. For instance, if we use \ud835\udc5d \ud835\udc56,\ud835\udc57 and 1 -\ud835\udc5d \ud835\udc56,\ud835\udc57 as the probabilities for selecting and not selecting the \ud835\udc57-th embedding dimension for sample \ud835\udc56, respectively, the Gumbel-Max trick to approximate Bernoulli distribution sampling can then be expressed as:\n\ud835\udc9b \ud835\udc56,\ud835\udc57 = one hot (arg max (log \ud835\udc5d \ud835\udc56,\ud835\udc57 + \ud835\udc3a \ud835\udc56,\ud835\udc57 , log(1 -\ud835\udc5d \ud835\udc56,\ud835\udc57 ) + \ud835\udc3a \u2032 \ud835\udc56,\ud835\udc57 )),(1)\nwhere \ud835\udc3a \ud835\udc56,\ud835\udc57 and \ud835\udc3a \u2032 \ud835\udc56,\ud835\udc57 are i.i.d. samples drawn from a Gumbel distribution with the location at 0 and scale of 1, denoted as Gumbel(0, 1). However, both the \"one hot()\" and \"arg max()\" operations are nondifferentiable, making them intractable for gradient descent optimization. Therefore, the softmax function is used as a continuous, (2) As \ud835\udf0f approaches 0, \ud835\udc9b \ud835\udc56,\ud835\udc57 approximates the true binary vector, making the Gumbel-Softmax distribution become identical to the desired Bernoulli distribution. Then the final embedding masks, \ud835\udc8e \ud835\udc56 , are created by concatenating the first bit of {\ud835\udc9b \ud835\udc56,\ud835\udc57 } \ud835\udc41 * \ud835\udc57=1 . However, our goal remains to produce true binary masks, which would effectively eliminate information from unimportant dimensions, as opposed to significantly shrinking them. The straightthrough (ST) Gumbel-Softmax [2,11] serves well in this context. In the ST variant, the operation from Equation 1 is implemented in the forward pass while the continuous approximation from Equation 2is used in the backward gradient descent. This approach enables sparse selection even when the temperature \ud835\udf0f is high, while still allowing the gradient to propagate and update the parameters.", "publication_ref": ["b22", "b10", "b20", "b6", "b21", "b1", "b10"], "figure_ref": ["fig_1", "fig_1"], "table_ref": []}, {"heading": "Deterministic Selection.", "text": "After training the Bernoulli probabilities (\ud835\udc5d \ud835\udc56,\ud835\udc57 ) during the searching phase, we utilize these probabilities to determine which dimensions will contribute to the accuracy of the recommendation predictions. However, \ud835\udc5d \ud835\udc56,\ud835\udc57 are characterized by high variance and heavy-tailedness, as shown by the histogram in Figure 3 (left). These present two complications: (1) distinguishing important dimensions from unimportant ones becomes challenging; and (2) even the unimportant dimensions still possess a small probability of being selected. Moreover, masks created using Bernoulli gates introduce an element of randomness (Gumbel noise), which hinders their direct application during inference (where given the same data each time, consistent results should be generated).\nTo overcome these limitations, we propose a deterministic selection mode that directly selects the beneficial dimensions using the knowledge derived from the well-trained Bernoulli probabilities. This process is outlined in Figure 2 (bottom left). Firstly, we use the same FC layer and sigmoid layer to estimate the Bernoulli probabilities, \ud835\udc5d \ud835\udc56,\ud835\udc57 , analogous to the first step in the stochastic selection mode.\nThen, for each sample \ud835\udc56, we search a threshold among the probabilities {\ud835\udc5d \ud835\udc56,\ud835\udc57 } \ud835\udc41 * \ud835\udc57=1 (see details in Section 3.3.3).

Empirically, we have observed this polarization term effectively separates the probabilities of important and unimportant dimensions into two groups, thereby making them distinguishable (see Figure 3).

Nonetheless, training an extensive number of recommender models is impractical due to the constraint of finite data size. For example, with a obviously underestimated dimension, \ud835\udc41 * = 100, the number of possible combinations of dimensions is 100 \ud835\udc58=0 100 \ud835\udc58 = 2 100 , meaning at least 2 100 distinct samples should be collected.\nConsequently, we must strike a balance between using a one-sizefits-all recommender model (inadequate for highly heterogeneous samples) and using a fully-customized recommender model for each sample.

A higher AUC value indicates superior model performance. On the other hand, Logloss, aka binary cross-entropy loss, directly quantifies the model's performance, with a lower score denoting more accurate predictions. Note that a marginal 0.001-level improvement in AUC (increase) or Logloss (decrease) is perceived as a significant enhancement in model performance [19,33,37].", "publication_ref": ["b16", "b24", "b18", "b32", "b36"], "figure_ref": [], "table_ref": []}, {"heading": "Baseline Methods", "text": "We compare our proposed method with the following state-of-theart methods:\n\u2022 PEP [17]: It adopts trainable thresholds to prune redundant embedding dimensions. \u2022 AutoField [33]: It utilizes neural architecture search techniques [16] to select important field features. \u2022 OptEmbed [20]: It trains a supernet with various selected embedding dimensions, then uses evolution search to find the optimal embedding dimensions based on the supernet. \u2022 AdaFS [15]: It assigns weights to different fields in a soft manner (AdaFS-soft) or masks unimportant fields in a hard manner (AdaFS-hard) via a novel controller network. \u2022 OptFS [19]: It simultaneously selects optimal field features and the optimal interactions between these features using \"binary gates\".", "publication_ref": ["b16", "b32", "b15", "b19", "b14", "b18"], "figure_ref": [], "table_ref": []}, {"heading": "Implementation Details", "text": "We implement our method based on a public libraryfoot_0 that involves sixteen commonly-used DLRMs. As our framework is modelagnostic, it can be seamlessly integrated with any of these models, see Section 4.6. For the embedding layer, we set the initial embedding size of all fields as 16 in accordance with the previous works [15,33]. For the MLP component, we adopt two fully-connected layers of size (16,8) with the ReLU activation function. We use Adam optimizer [13] with an initial learning rate of 0.001, and weight decay of 1e-6. The batch size is set to 2048. We sample one validation batch every 100 training batches for bi-level optimization.\nThe temperature \ud835\udf0f for ST Gumbel-Softmax is set to 0.1. The baseline models are implemented by the codes provided by their authors. For a fair comparison, we set the initial embedding dimension as 16 for all baselines. All the experiments are run on a single machine with an Nvidia RTX 3090 GPU.  First, our iHAS outperforms all the state-of-the-art baseline methods as it can achieve higher AUC and lower Logloss on both datasets, demonstrating the effectiveness of iHAS in deep recommendation systems. Specifically, iHAS outperforms the runner-ups by 0.0038 (AUC) and 0.0021 (Logloss) on the Avazu datasets, and by 0.0004 (AUC) and 0.0006 (Logloss) on the Criteo datasets.\nSecondly, among all baselines, AdaFS-soft is the most effective model for the Avazu and Criteo datasets. However, it only shrinks the field features using a feature weighting layer and therefore does not completely eliminate the effect of unimportant fields. Although AdaFS-hard attempts to mask unimportant fields by uniformly keeping the top \ud835\udc3e features, the trained feature weights may still exhibit a high variance pattern (remember the non-distinguishable probabilities in Figure 3, left panel). Therefore, this top \ud835\udc3e selection manner may lead to selecting unimportant features or omitting the important feature in their final model, further compromising the model performance. Our polarization regularizer and threshold searcher can help with this issue, as detailed in Section 3.3.3 and evidenced by the empirical ablation study in Section 4.7.\nLastly, other baselines apply global feature/dimension selection across all samples, which fails to account for inherent variations among heterogeneous individuals, and consequently leads to suboptimal performance. Additionally, PEP mainly emphasizes on the model size, i.e., it stops searching once the embedding table reaches a predefined parameter size. This approach may result in a suboptimal embedding table due to overlooking the model performance.

This aligns with human intuition as the id-related features are the core of recommender systems; (iii) Samples within different clusters tend to select different dimensions for each field, which validates our claim that different clusters present different  patterns and should be trained separately to enhance performance and reduce inference time in Section 3.4. Furthermore, we use four samples to illustrate the effectiveness of the iHAS framework consisting of group-customized recommender models. Figure 6 shows four samples grouped into two clusters (two in pink and two in cyan). Each cluster has its customized recommender model.

Subsequent stages of clustering and retraining provide a mechanism for gathering similar samples as clusters and training cluster-customized DLRMs based on the individual optimal dimensions, thereby enhancing recommendation predictions.
