INTRODUCTION", "text": "Random key graphs have received significant interest recently with applications spanning key predistribution in secure wireless sensor networks (WSNs) [2], [5], [8], [9], [13], social networks [7], [18], [41], recommender systems [27], clustering and classification analysis [4], [19], cryptanalysis of hash functions [3], circuit design [35], and the modeling of epidemics [1] and \"small-world\" networks [38]. They belong to a larger class of random graphs known as random intersection graphs [2]- [7], [10], [14], [28], [34], [35]; in fact, they are referred to as uniform random intersection graphs by some authors [2], [3], [6], [28], [32]- [34], [45], [46].\nTo fix the terminology, we will describe random key graphs in the context of secure WSNs, where they have originated from. Security is expected to be a key challenge in resource constrained sensor networks. A widely accepted solution for securing WSN communications is the random predistribution of cryptographic keys to sensor nodes, and utilization of symmetric-key encryption modes [17], [21], [31] to ensure message secrecy and authenticity. Among various key predistribution algorithms proposed to date, the original scheme by Eschenauer and Gligor (EG) [13] is still the most widely recognized one. According to the EG scheme, each of the n sensors is assigned K n distinct keys that are selected uniformly at random from a key pool of size P n . Two sensors can then securely communicate over an existing communication link if they have at least one key in common; i.e., if they share a common key. This notion of adjacency defines the random key graph, hereafter denoted by G(n, K n , P n ). For generality, K n and P n are assumed to scale with the number of nodes n, with the natural condition 1 \u2264 K n \u2264 P n always imposed.\nIn this paper, we study connectivity properties of random key graphs in the presence of unreliable links. Unreliability of the edges are captured by independent Bernoulli random variables, rendering each edge of G(n; K n , P n ) to be on (with probability p n ) or off (with probability 1p n ) independently from all other edges. Put differently, we consider an Erd\u0151s-R\u00e9nyi (ER) graph G(n; p n ) [11] on the same set of n vertices, with edges appearing between any pair of vertices independently with probability p n . A random key graph with unreliable links thus corresponds to the intersection of a random key graph and an ER graph. Hereafter, we denote this graph by G on = G(n; K n , p n ) \u2229 G(n; p n ); see Section III for precise definitions.\nJust like the random key graph, the G on model can be used in various applications, particularly when links are expected to be unreliable. For example, in a secure WSN application, links might be unreliable due to wireless media of the communication, or due to physical obstacles and altering environmental conditions severally impairing the transmission. We refer the reader to [39] and [41] for two other applications of G on : i) secure connectivity of WSNs under an on-off channel model, and ii) large scale, distributed publish-subscribe services in online social networks, respectively.\nThe main goal of this paper to study k-connectivity of G on . A network (or graph) is said to be k-connected if for each pair of nodes there exist at least k mutually disjoint paths connecting them. An equivalent definition of k-connectivity is that a network is k-connected if the network remains connected despite the failure of any (k -1) nodes [29]; a network is said to be simply connected if it is 1-connected. kconnectivity is a fundamental graph property and is important for various applications of random key graphs. For example, in a WSN application where sensor nodes operate autonomously and physically unprotected, k-connectivity provides communication security against an adversary that is able to compromise up to k -1 links by launching a sensor capture attack [8]; i.e., two sensors can communicate securely as long as at least one of the k disjoint paths connecting them consists of links that are not compromised by the adversary. Also, k-connectivity improves resiliency against network disconnection due to battery depletion, in both normal mode of operation and under battery-depletion attacks [26]. Furthermore, it enables flexible communication-load balancing across multiple paths so that network energy consumption is distributed without penalizing any access path [15].\nOur main contributions are zero-one laws for two related graph properties for G on : i) the minimum node degree being at least k, and ii) k-connectivity. Namely, we present conditions on how to scale the model parameters K n , P n , p n such that these properties hold with probability approaching to one and zero, respectively, as the number of nodes n becomes large. Our main results also imply a zero-one law for k-connectivity in random key graph G(n, K n , P n ) (see Corollary 2), and the established result is shown to improve that given previously by Rybarczyk [32]; see Section IV-D for details. Moreover, for the 1-connectivity of G on , we provide a stronger form of the zero-one law as compared to that given by Yagan [37]; see Section IV-D.\nWe organize the rest of the paper as follows: In Section II, we survey the relevant results from the literature, while in Section III we give a detailed description of the system model G on . The main results of the paper are presented (see Theorem 1) in Section IV, with a detailed discussion and comparisons with the existing results given in Section IV-D; also, in Section IV-E we provide numerical results that confirm Theorem 1. The basic ideas that pave the way in establishing Theorem 1 are given in Section V. Sections VI through VIII are devoted to establishing the zero-law part of Theorem 1, whereas the one-law of Theorem 1 is established in Sections IX through XIII.

The probability p can also be a function of n, in which case we refer to it as p n . Throughout the paper, we refer to the random graph G(n, p n ) as an Erd\u0151s-R\u00e9nyi (ER) graph following the convention in the literature.\nErd\u0151s and R\u00e9nyi [11] prove that when p n is ln n+\u03b1n n , graph G(n, p n ) is asymptotically almost surely 1 (a.a.s.) connected (resp., not connected) if lim n\u2192\u221e \u03b1 n = +\u221e (resp., lim n\u2192\u221e \u03b1 n = -\u221e). In later work [12], they further explore k-connectivity [30] in G(n, p n ) and show that if p n = 1 We say that an event takes place asymptotically almost surely if its probability approaches to 1 as n \u2192 \u221e. Also, we use \"resp.\" as a shorthand for \"respectively\".\nln n+(k-1) ln ln n+\u03b1n n\n, G(n, p n ) is a.a.s. k-connected (resp., not k-connected) if lim n\u2192\u221e \u03b1 n = +\u221e (resp., lim n\u2192\u221e \u03b1 n = -\u221e).\nPrevious work [2], [32], [39] investigates the zero-one law for connectivity in random key graph G(n, K n , P n ), where P n and K n are the key pool size and the key ring size, respectively. Blackburn and Gerke [2] prove that if K n \u2265 2 and P n = \u230an \u03be \u230b, where \u03be is a positive constant, G(n, K n , P n ) is a.a.s. connected (resp., not connected) if lim inf n\u2192+\u221e\nK 2 n n Pn ln n > 1 (resp., lim sup n\u2192+\u221e K 2 n n\nPn ln n < 1). Yagan and Makowski [39] demonstrate that iffoot_0 K n \u2265 2, P n = \u2126(n) and\nK 2 n Pn = ln n+\u03b1n n , then G(n, K n , P n ) is a.a.s. connected (resp., not connected) if lim n\u2192\u221e \u03b1 n = +\u221e (resp., lim n\u2192\u221e \u03b1 n = -\u221e).\nRybarczyk [32] obtains a stronger result without requiring P n = \u2126(n). In particular, she derives the asymptotically exact probability of connectivity in G(n, K n , P n ) as follows: under K n \u2265 2, if the sequence \u03b1 n defined through\nK 2 n Pn = ln n+\u03b1n n has a limit \u03b1 * \u2208 [-\u221e, \u221e], then the probability of G(n, K n , P n ) being connected approaches to e -e -\u03b1 *\nas n \u2192 \u221e. This asymptotically exact probability result is stronger than a zeroone law since the latter can be obtained by setting \u03b1 * as \u221e and -\u221e in the former. Rybarczyk also establishes [33, Remark 1, p. 5] a zero-one law for k-connectivity in G(n, K n , P n ) by showing the similarity between G(n, K n , P n ) and a random intersection graph [5] via a coupling argument. Specifically, she proves that if P n = \u0398(n \u03be ) for some \u03be > 1 and\nK 2 n Pn = ln n+(k-1) ln ln n+\u03b1n n , then the G(n, K n , P n ) is a.a.s. k-connected (resp., not k-connected) if lim n\u2192\u221e \u03b1 n = +\u221e (resp., lim n\u2192\u221e \u03b1 n = -\u221e).\nRecently Yagan [37] gives a zero-one law for connectivity (i.e., 1-connectivity) in graph G(n, K n , P n )\u2229G(n, p n ), which is the intersection of random key graph G(n, K n , P n ) and random graph G(n, p n ), and clearly is equivalent to our key graph G on ; see Section III. Specifically, he proves that if\nK n \u2265 2, P n = \u2126(n) and p n \u2022 1 - ( Pn -Kn Kn ) ( Pn Kn )\n\u223c c ln n n hold, and lim n\u2192\u221e (p n ln n) exists, then graph G(n, K n , P n ) \u2229 G(n, p n ) is asymptotically almost surely connected (resp., not connected) if c > 1 (resp., c < 1). A comparison of our results with the related work is given in Section IV-D.\nAfter the submission of this paper, we have derived the asymptotically exact probability of k-connectivity in G(n, K n , P n ) [45] (resp., G on [44]). Based on the proofs in this paper, we show i) that [45] under P n = \u2126(n), if the sequence \u03b1 n defined through\nK 2 n Pn = ln n+(k-1) ln ln n+\u03b1n n has a limit \u03b1 * \u2208 [-\u221e, \u221e], then the probability of G(n, K n , P n ) being k-connected converges to e -e -\u03b1 *\n(k-1)! as n \u2192 \u221e, and ii) that [44] under P n = \u2126(n) and Kn Pn = o(1), if the sequence\n\u03b1 n defined through p n \u2022 1 - ( Pn -Kn Kn ) ( Pn Kn ) = ln n+(k-1) ln ln n+\u03b1n n has a limit \u03b1 * \u2208 [-\u221e, \u221e],\nthen the probability of G on being k-connected converges to e -e -\u03b1 * (k-1)! as n \u2192 \u221e.", "publication_ref": ["b10", "b15", "b10", "b11", "b29", "b1", "b31", "b38", "b1", "b38", "b31", "b4", "b36", "b44", "b43", "b44", "b43"], "figure_ref": [], "table_ref": []}, {"heading": "III.

Each node v i \u2208 V is assigned a key ring S i that consists of K n distinct keys selected uniformly at random from a key pool P of size P n . The random key graph G(n, K n , P n ) is defined on the vertex set V such that two distinct nodes v i and v j are adjacent, denoted K ij , if their key rings have at least one key in common; i.e.,\nK ij = [S i \u2229 S j = \u2205].\nFor distinct nodes v x and v y , we let S xy denote the intersection of their key rings S x and S y ; i.e., S xy = S x \u2229 S y .\nOur main interest is to study random key graphs whose links are unreliable. In particular, we assume that each link is on with probability p n , or off with probability 1p n , independently from any other link. Namely, with C ij denoting the event that link between v i and v j is on, {C ij , 1 \u2264 i < j \u2264 n} are mutually independent such that\nP [C ij ] = p n , 1 \u2264 i < j \u2264 n.(1)\nThis unreliable link model can be represented [11] by an Erd\u0151s-R\u00e9nyi (ER) graph G(n, p n ) on the vertices V such that there exists an edge between nodes v i and v j if the link between them is on; i.e., if the event C ij takes place.\nFinally, the graph G on (n, K n , P n , p n ) is defined on the vertices V such that two distinct nodes v i and v j have an edge in between, denoted E ij , if the events K ij and C ij take place at the same time. In other words, we have\nE ij = K ij \u2229 C ij , 1 \u2264 i < j \u2264 n(2)\nso that\nG on (n, K n , P n , p n ) = G(n, K n , P n ) \u2229 G(n, p n ).(3)\nThroughout, we simplify the notation by writing G on instead of G on (n, K n , P n , p n ). Thus, our main model G on is an intersection of a random key graph and an ER graph. Throughout, we let p s (K n , P n ) be the probability that the key rings of two distinct nodes share at least one key and let p e (K n , P n , p n ) be the probability that there exists a link between two distinct nodes in G on . For simplicity, we write p s (K n , P n ) as p s and write p e (K n , P n , p n ) as p e .

The Main Result", "text": "The main result of this paper, given below, establishes zero-one laws for k-connectivity and for the property that the minimum node degree is no less than k in graph G on . Throughout this paper, k is a positive integer and does not scale with n. Also, we let N (resp., N 0 ) stand for the set of all non-negative (resp., positive) integers.\nWe refer to any pair of mappings K, P : N 0 \u2192 N 0 as a scaling as long as it satisfies the natural conditions\nK n \u2264 P n , n = 1, 2, . . . .(8)\nSimilarly, any mapping p : N 0 \u2192 (0, 1) defines a scaling.\nTheorem 1. Consider scalings K, P : N 0 \u2192 N 0 , p : N 0 \u2192 (0, 1) such that K n \u2265 2 for all n sufficiently large.

Therefore, Theorem 1 presents the zero-one laws of k-connectivity and the minimum node degree in graph G on . We also see from (9) that the critical scaling for both properties is given by p e = ln n+(k-1) ln ln n n . The sequence \u03b1 n : N 0 \u2192 R defined through (9) therefore measures by how much the probability p e deviates from the critical scaling.\nIn case (b) of Theorem 1, the conditions P n = \u2126(n) and Kn Pn = o(1) indicate that the size of the key pool P n should grow at least linearly with the number of sensor nodes in the network, and should grow unboundedly with the size of each key ring. These conditions are enforced here merely for technical reasons, but they hold trivially in practical wireless sensor network applications [8], [9], [13]. Again, the condition 1) enforced for the zero-law in Theorem 1 is not a stringent one since the P n is expected to be several orders of magnitude larger than K n . Finally, the condition that either p e n > \u01eb > 0 for all n large or lim n\u2192\u221e p e n = 0 is imposed to avoid degenerate situations. In most cases of interest it holds that p e n > \u01eb > 0 as otherwise the graph G on becomes trivially disconnected. To see this, notice that p e n is an upper-bound on the expected degree of a node and that the expected number of edges in the graph is less than p e n 2 ; yet, a connected graph on n nodes must have at least n -1 edges.\nK 2 n Pn = o(", "publication_ref": ["b11", "b9", "b11", "b10", "b8", "b8", "b7", "b8", "b12"], "figure_ref": [], "table_ref": []}, {"heading": "B.

Then, using we would automatically obtain Theorem 1 via the aforementioned results of Erd\u0151s and R\u00e9nyi [12]. Unfortunately, such heuristic approaches can not be taken for granted as G(n, K n , P n ) = G(n, p s ) in general. For instance, the two graphs are shown [38], [40] to exhibit quite different characteristics in terms of properties including clustering coefficient, number of triangles, etc. To this end, Theorem 1 formally validates the above intuition for the k-connectivity property, and it is worth mentioning that we establish Theorem 1 with a direct proof that does not rely on coupling arguments between random key graph and ER graph.\nG on \u2243 G(n, p s ) \u2229 G(n, p n ) = G(n, p n p s ) = G(n, p e ),\nWe now compare our results with those of Rybarczyk [33] for the k-connectivity of random key graph G(n, K n , P n ). As already noted, Rybarczyk [33, Remark 1, p. 5] has established an analog of Corollary 2, but under assumptions much stronger than ours. In particular, her result requires that P n = \u0398(n \u03be ) where \u03be > 1. In comparison, Corollary 2 established here enforces only that P n \u2265 \u2126(n), which is clearly a much weaker condition than P n = \u0398(n \u03be ) with \u03be > 1. More importantly, our condition P n \u2265 \u2126(n) requires (from (20)) only that K n = \u2126( \u221a ln n) for the one-law to hold; i.e., for G on to be k-connected. However, the condition P n = \u0398(n \u03be ) with \u03be > 1 enforced in [33] requires the key ring sizes to satisfy K n = \u2126( \u221a n \u03be-1 ln n) with \u03be -1 > 0. This condition not only constitutes a much stronger requirement than K n = \u2126( \u221a ln n), but it also renders the k-connectivity result given in [33] not applicable in the context of WSNs. This is because K n controls the number of keys kept in each sensor's memory, and should be very small [13] due to limited memory and computational capability of sensor nodes; in general K n = O(ln n) is accepted [9] as a reasonable bound on the key ring sizes.\nFinally, we compare Theorem 1 with the zero-one law given by Yagan [37] for the 1-connectivity of G on . As mentioned in Section II above, he shows that if\np e \u223c c ln n n = ln n + (c -1) ln n n(22)\nthen G on is a.a.s. connected if c > 1, and it is a.a.s. not connected if c < 1. This was done under the additional \nG o n is k-connected p = 0.2 k = 4 k = 6 k = 8 k = 10\nFig. 2. Empirical probability that Gon(n, K, P, p) is k-connected for k = 4, 6, 8, and 10. We take n = 2000, P = 10, 000 and p = 0.2. Vertical dashed lines stand for the critical threshold of k-connectivity asserted by Theorem 1.\nconditions that P n = \u2126(n) (required only for the one-law) and that lim n\u2192\u221e p n ln n exists (required only for the zerolaw). On the other hand, Theorem 1 given here establishes (by setting k = 1) that, if\np e = ln n + \u03b1 n n(23)\nthen G on is a.a.s. connected if lim n\u2192\u221e \u03b1 n = \u221e, and it is a.a.s. not connected if lim n\u2192\u221e \u03b1 n = -\u221e. This result relies on the extra conditions P n = \u2126(n) and Kn Pn = o(1) for the one-law and on\nK 2 n Pn = o(1)\nfor the zero-law. Comparing ( 22) and ( 23), we see that our 1-connectivity result for G on is somewhat more fine-grained than Yagan's [37]. This is because, a deviation of \u03b1 n = \u00b1\u2126(ln n) is required to get the zero-one law in the form (22), whereas in our formulation (23), it suffices to have an unbounded deviation; e.g., even \u03b1 n = \u00b1 ln ln \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 ln n will do. Put differently, we cover the case of c = 1 in (22) (i.e., the case when p e \u223c ln n n ) and show that G on could be almost surely connected or not connected, depending on the limit of \u03b1 n ; in fact, if (22) holds with c > 1, we see from Theorem 1 that G on is not only 1connected but also k-connected for any k = 1, 2, . . .. However, it is worth noting that the additional conditions assumed in [37] are weaker than those we enforce in Theorem 1 for k = 1.", "publication_ref": ["b1", "b10", "b11", "b31", "b32", "b38", "b4", "b11", "b32", "b20", "b11", "b37", "b39", "b32", "b32", "b32", "b12", "b8", "b36", "b36", "b21", "b22", "b21", "b36"], "figure_ref": [], "table_ref": []}, {"heading": "E.

For Figure 1, we consider several different probabilities of links being on; specifically, we have p = 0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8, while varying the parameter K from 5 to 23; recall that K stands for the number of keys per node. For Figure 2, we fix p = 0.2 and vary K from 16 to 29. For each parameter pair (K, p), we generate 200 independent samples of the graph G on (n, K, P, p) and count the number of times (out of a possible 200) that the obtained graphs i) have minimum node degree no less than k and ii) are k-connected, for k = 1, 2, . . .. Dividing the counts by 200, we obtain the (empirical) probabilities for the events of interest. In all cases, we observe that G on is k-connected whenever its minimum node degree is no less than k, yielding the same empirical probability for both events. This confirms the asymptotic equivalence of the properties of k-connectivity and the minimum node degree being no less than k in G on as stated in Theorem 1.\nFigure 1 plots the empirical probability of 2-connectivity in G on versus K for different p values, while Figure 2 depicts the empirical probability of k-connectivity in G on versus K for different k.

(60)\nPropositions 1 and 2 are established in Section VII and Section VIII, respectively. Now, we complete the proof of Lemma 3. Under the condition p e n > \u01eb > 0, (55) follows from (58) and (60) in view of (57). For \u2113 = 0, we obtain (56) by using (59) in (57) and noting that P[D x,0 \u2229D y,0 \u2229E xy ] = 0 always holds; it is not possible for nodes v x and v y to have degree zero and yet to have an edge in between.\nWe now complete the proof of ( 51) and ( 53) under ( 45) and (46). First, in view of ( 9) and the condition lim n\u2192\u221e \u03b1 n = -\u221e, we obtain p e \u2264 ln n+(k-1) ln ln n n for all n sufficiently large. Thus, p e = o 1\n\u221a n , and we use Lemma 2 to get\nnP [D x,\u2113 ] \u223c n \u2022 (\u2113!) -1 (p e n) \u2113 e -pen(61)\nfor each \u2113 = 0, 1, . . .. The proof will be given in two steps. First, in the case where there exists an \u01eb > 0 such that p e n > \u01eb for all n sufficiently large, we will establish (51) and ( 53) for \u2113 = k -1. Next, for the case where lim n\u2192\u221e p e n = 0, we will show that (51) and (53) hold for \u2113 = 0. Assume now that p e n > \u01eb > 0 for all n sufficiently large. Substituting ( 9) into (61) with \u2113 = k -1, we get\nnP [D x,k-1 ](62)\n\u223c n \u2022 [(k -1)!] -1 (p e n) k-1 e -ln n-(k-1) ln ln n-\u03b1n = [(k -1)!] -1 \u00d7 (ln n + (k -1) ln ln n + \u03b1 n ) k-1 e -(k-1) ln ln n-\u03b1n . Let f n (k; \u03b1 n ) := (ln n + (k -1) ln ln n + \u03b1 n ) k-1 e -(k-1) ln ln n-\u03b1n ,\nand observe that we have ln n + (k -1) ln ln n + \u03b1 n \u2265 \u01eb for all n sufficiently large since p e n > \u01eb. On that range, fix n, pick 0 < \u03b3 < 1 and consider the cases \u03b1 n \u2264 -(1\u03b3) ln n and \u03b1 n > -(1\u03b3) ln n. In the former case, we have\nf n (k; \u03b1 n ) \u2265 \u01eb \u2022 e -(k-1) ln ln n+(1-\u03b3) ln n ,\nwhereas in the latter we obtain\nf n (k; \u03b1 n ) \u2265 (\u03b3 ln n) k-1 e -(k-1) ln ln n-\u03b1n = \u03b3 k-1 e -\u03b1n .\nThus, for all n sufficiently large, we have\nf n (k; \u03b1 n ) \u2265 min \u01eb \u2022 e -(k-1) ln ln n+(1-\u03b3) ln n , \u03b3 k-1 e -\u03b1n .\nIt is now easy to see that lim n\u2192\u221e f n (k; \u03b1 n ) = \u221e since 0 < \u03b3 < 1 and lim n\u2192\u221e \u03b1 n = -\u221e. Substituting this into (62), we obtain (51) with \u2113 = k -1. In addition, from (54) of Lemma 2, and (55) of Lemma 3, it is clear that (53) follows with \u2113 = k -1. As mentioned already, (51) and ( 53) imply ( 47) and (48) in view of Lemma 1, and the zero-law ( 11) is now established for the case when p e n > \u01eb > 0.\nWe now turn to the case where lim n\u2192\u221e p e n = p \u22c6 e = 0. This time, we let \u2113 = 0 in (61) and obtain\nnP [D x,0 ] \u223c ne -pen \u223c n.\nWe clearly have (51) for \u2113 = 0. Also, from (54) of Lemma 2 with \u2113 = 0, and (56) of Lemma 3, we obtain (53) for \u2113 = 0. Having obtained (51) and ( 53) for \u2113 = 0, we get (47) and ( 48) and the zero-law ( 11) is now established from Fact 1 (c).", "publication_ref": ["b45"], "figure_ref": [], "table_ref": []}, {"heading": "VII.

Given (108) and mutually exclusive events B h (h = 0, 1, . . . , \u2113 -1), we obtain\nP[D x,\u2113 \u2229 D y,\u2113 \u2229 E xy ] = \u2113-1 h=0 P [B h \u2229 E xy ] .(109)\nWe will establish Proposition 2 by obtaining the following result which evaluates the R.H.S. of (109). \nP [B h \u2229 E xy ] = o \u2113 h=0 P A h \u2229 K xy . (110\n)\nIn order to see why Proposition 2 follows from Proposition 2.1, observe that (110) establishes (106) with the help of (109).

We first calculate\nP [B h | (|S xy | = u)]. Given the definition of B h in (107), we let m 1 = h and m 2 = m 3 = \u2113 -h -1 in Lemma 4 to obtain P [B h | (|S xy | = u)] \u223c n 2\u2113-h-2 h![(\u2113 -h -1)!] 2 \u2022 e -2pen+ pepnu Kn n \u00d7 {P[E xj\u2229yj | (|S xy | = u)]} h \u00d7 {P[E xj\u2229yj | (|S xy | = u)]} \u2113-h-1 \u00d7 {P[E xj\u2229yj | (|S xy | = u)]} \u2113-h-1 .

ESTABLISHING (12) (THE ONE-LAW", "text": "FOR k-CONNECTIVITY IN G on )\nAs shown in Section V-B, we can enforce the extra condition \u03b1 n = o(ln n) in establishing (12) (i.e., the one-law for kconnectivity in G on ). Therefore, we will establish (12) under the following conditions: (9), K n \u2265 2 for all n sufficiently large , P n = \u2126(n), (118)\nK n P n = o(1), lim n\u2192\u221e \u03b1 n = +\u221e and \u03b1 n = o(ln n).(119)\nIn graph G on , consider scalings K, P : N 0 \u2192 N 0 and p : N 0 \u2192 (0, 1) as in Theorem 1. We find it useful to define a sequence \u03b2 \u2113,n : N \u00d7 N 0 \u2192 R through the relation\np e = ln n + \u2113 ln ln n + \u03b2 \u2113,n n(120)\nfor each n \u2208 N 0 and each \u2113 \u2208 N. (120) follows by just setting\n\u03b2 \u2113,n := np e -ln n -\u2113 ln ln n. (121\n)\nThe one-law (12) will follow from the next key result. Recall that, as defined in Section V-D, \u03ba is the connectivity of the graph G on , namely the minimum number nodes whose deletion makes it disconnected.\nLemma 5. Let \u2113 be a non-negative constant integer. If K n \u2265 2 for any sufficiently large n, P n = \u2126(n), Kn Pn = o(1), and (120) holds with \u03b2 \u2113,n = o(ln n) and lim n\u2192\u221e \u03b2 \u2113,n = +\u221e, then\nlim n\u2192\u221e P [\u03ba = \u2113] = 0. (122\n)\nWe now explain why the one-law (12) follows from Lemma 5. Consider p n , K n and P n such that (118) and (119) hold. Comparing ( 9) and (120), we get\n\u03b2 \u2113,n = (k -1 -\u2113) ln ln n + \u03b1 n . (123\n)\nSince \u03b1 n = o(ln n) and lim n\u2192\u221e \u03b1 n = +\u221e, we have for each \u2113 = 0, 1, . . . , k -1 that\nlim n\u2192\u221e \u03b2 \u2113,n = +\u221e and \u03b2 \u2113,n = o(ln n).(124)\nGiven (124), we use Lemma 5 and obtain\nlim n\u2192\u221e P [\u03ba = \u2113] = 0, \u2113 = 0, 1, . . . , k -1.\nFor any constant k, this implies lim n\u2192\u221e P [\u03ba \u2265 k] = 1, or equivalently\nlim n\u2192\u221e P [G on is k-connected ] = 1.\nThis completes the proof of the one-law (12). The remaining part of this section is devoted to the proof of Lemma 5. Proof. We present the steps of proving Lemma 5 below. First, by a crude bounding argument, we get\nP [\u03ba = \u2113] \u2264 P [(\u03ba = \u2113) \u2229 (\u03b4 > \u2113)] + P [\u03b4 \u2264 \u2113] ,\nwhere \u03b4 is the minimum node degree of graph G on , as defined in Section V-D. We will prove Lemma 5 by establishing the following two results under the enforced assumptions:\nlim n\u2192\u221e P [\u03b4 \u2264 \u2113] = 0 if lim n\u2192\u221e \u03b2 \u2113,n = +\u221e,(125)\nand\nlim n\u2192\u221e P [\u03ba = \u2113 \u2229 \u03b4 > \u2113] = 0 if lim n\u2192\u221e \u03b2 \u2113,n = +\u221e.(126)\nWe first establish (125). First, from \u2113 ln ln n = o(ln n), \u03b2 \u2113,n = o(ln n) and p e = ln n+\u2113 ln ln n+\u03b2 \u2113,n n\n, it is clear that p e \u223c ln n n . Then p e = o 1 \u221a n . Thus, from Lemmas 1 and 2, we get\nE X \u2113 = nP [D x,\u2113 ] \u223c n \u2022 (\u2113!) -1 (p e n) \u2113 e -pen .(127)\nSubstituting p e \u223c ln n n and (120) into (127), we get\nE X \u2113 \u223c n (\u2113!) -1 (ln n) \u2113 e -ln n-\u2113 ln ln n-\u03b2 \u2113,n = (\u2113!) -1 e -\u03b2 \u2113,n .\nIn view of the fact that lim n\u2192\u221e \u03b2 \u2113,n = +\u221e, we thus obtain E X \u2113 = o(1). Then from property (a) of Fact 1 (Section V-C), we get\nlim n\u2192\u221e P[\u03b4 = \u2113] = 0.(128)\nAs seen from ( 121), \u03b2 \u2113,n is decreasing in \u2113. Thus, we have\nlim n\u2192\u221e \u03b2 \u2113 \u22c6 ,n = +\u221e for each \u2113 \u22c6 = 0, 1, . . . , \u2113. It is also im- mediate from (121) that \u03b2 \u2113 \u22c6 ,n = o(ln n) since \u03b2 \u2113,n = o(ln n).\nTherefore, using the same arguments that lead to (128), we obtain\nlim n\u2192\u221e P[\u03b4 = \u2113 \u22c6 ] = 0, \u2113 \u22c6 = 0, 1, . . . , \u2113,\nand (125) follows immediately. As ( 125) is established, it remains to prove (126) in order to complete the proof of Lemma 5. The basic idea in establishing ( 126) is to find a sufficiently tight upper bound on the probability P [\u03ba = \u2113 \u2229 \u03b4 > \u2113] and then to show that this bound tends to zero as n goes to +\u221e. This approach is similar to the one used for proving the one-law for k-connectivity in Erd\u0151s-R\u00e9nyi graphs [12], as well as to the approach used by Yagan [37] to establish the one-law for connectivity in the graph G on .\nWe start by obtaining the needed upper bound. Let N denote the collection of all non-empty subsets of {v 1 , . . . , v n }. We define\nN * = {T | T \u2208 N , |T | \u2265 2} and K T = \u222a vi\u2208T S i .\nFor the reasons that will later become apparent we find it useful to introduce the event E(J ) in the following manner:\nE(J ) = T \u2208N * |K T | \u2264 J |T | ,(129)\nwhere J = [J 2 , J 3 , . . . , J n ] is an (n -1)-dimensional integer valued array. Let\nr n := min P n K n , n 2 . (130\n)\nWe define J i as follows:\nJ i = max{\u230a(1 + \u03b5)K n \u230b , \u230a\u03bbK n i\u230b} i = 2, . . . , r n , \u230a\u00b5P n \u230b i = r n + 1, . . . , n.(131)\nfor some arbitrary constant 0 < \u03b5 < 1 and constants \u03bb, \u00b5 in (0, 1 2 ) that will be specified later; see (134)-(135) below. By a crude bounding argument we now get\nP [(\u03ba = \u2113) \u2229 (\u03b4 > \u2113)] \u2264 P [E(J )] + P (\u03ba = \u2113) \u2229 (\u03b4 > \u2113) \u2229 E(J ) . (132)\nHence, a proof of (126) consists of establishing the following two propositions.\nProposition 3. Let \u2113 be a non-negative constant integer. If (120) holds with \u03b2 \u2113,n > 0, K n \u2265 2 and P n \u2265 \u03c3n for some \u03c3 > 0 for all n sufficiently large and Kn Pn = o(1), then\nlim n\u2192\u221e P [E(J )] = 0,(133)\nwhere J = [J 2 , J 3 , . . . , J n ] is as specified in (131) with arbitrary \u03b5 in (0, 1), constant \u03bb in (0, 1 2 ) is selected small enough to ensure\nmax 2\u03bb\u03c3, \u03bb e 2 \u03c3 \u03bb 1-2\u03bb < 1,(134)\nand constant \u00b5 in (0, 1 2 ) is selected so that\nmax 2 \u221a \u00b5 e \u00b5 \u00b5 \u03c3 , \u221a \u00b5 e \u00b5 \u00b5 < 1.(135)\nA proof of Proposition 3 is given in Section X below. Note that for any \u03c3 > 0, lim \u03bb\u21930 \u03bb e 2 \u03c3 \u03bb 1-2\u03bb = 0 so that the condition (134) can always be met by suitably selecting constant \u03bb > 0 small enough. Also, we have lim \u00b5\u21930 e \u00b5 \u00b5 = 1, whence\nlim \u00b5\u21930 \u221a \u00b5 e \u00b5 \u00b5\n= 0, and (135) can be made to hold for any constant \u03c3 > 0 by taking \u00b5 > 0 sufficiently small. Finally, we remark that the condition P n \u2265 \u03c3n for some \u03c3 > 0 is equivalent to having P n = \u2126(n). Proposition 4. Let \u2113 be a non-negative constant integer. If K n \u2265 2 and P n \u2265 \u03c3n for some \u03c3 > 0 for all n sufficiently large, Kn Pn = o(1), and (120) holds with \u03b2 \u2113,n = o(ln n) and lim n\u2192\u221e \u03b2 \u2113,n = +\u221e, then\nlim n\u2192\u221e P (\u03ba = \u2113) \u2229 (\u03b4 > \u2113) \u2229 E(J ) = 0,\nwhere J = [J 2 , J 3 , . . . , J n ] is as specified in (131) with arbitrary \u03b5 in (0, 1), constant \u00b5 in (0, 1  2 ) selected small enough to ensure (135) and constant \u03bb \u2208 (0, 1  2 ) selected such that it satisfies (134).\nA proof of Proposition 4 is given in Section XI below.\nUsing Proposition 3 and Proposition 4 (with the same constants \u03b5, \u03bb, \u00b5) in (132), we obtain the desired conclusion (126).

Proposition 3 is now established.", "publication_ref": ["b35", "b35"], "figure_ref": [], "table_ref": []}, {"heading": "XI. A PROOF OF PROPOSITION 4", "text": "We start by introducing some notation. For any non-empty subset U of nodes, i.e., U \u2286 {v 1 , . . . , v n }, we define the graph G on (U ) (with vertex set U ) as the subgraph of G on restricted to the nodes in U . If all nodes in U are deleted from G on , the remaining graph is given by G on (U c ) on the vertices U c = {v 1 , . . . , v n } \\ U . Let N U c denote the collection of all nonempty subsets of {v 1 , . . . , v n } \\ U . We say that a subset T in N U c is isolated in G on (U c ) if there are no edges (in G on ) between the nodes in T and the nodes in U c \\ T . This is characterized by\nE ij , v i \u2208 T, v j \u2208 U c \\ T.\nWith each non-empty subset T \u2286 U c of nodes, we associate several events of interest: Let C T denote the event that the subgraph G on (T ) is itself connected. The event C T is completely determined by the random variables (rvs) {S i , v i \u2208 T } and {C ij , v i , v j \u2208 T }. We also introduce the event D U,T to capture the fact that T is isolated in G on (U c ), i.e., D U,T :=\nvi\u2208T vj \u2208U c \\T E ij .\nFinally, we let B U,T denote the event that each node in U has an edge with at least one node in T , i.e., B U,T :=\nvi\u2208U vj \u2208T E ij .\nWe also set\nA U,T := B U,T \u2229 C T \u2229 D U,T .\nThe proof starts with the following observations: In graph G on , if the connectivity is \u2113 (i.e., \u03ba = \u2113) and yet each node has degree at least \u2113 + 1 (i.e., \u03b4 > \u2113), then there must exist subsets U , T of nodes with\nU \u2208 N , |U | = \u2113 and T \u2208 N U c , |T | \u2265 2, such that G on (T ) is connected while T is isolated in G on (U c\n). This ensures that G on can be disconnected by deleting an appropriately selected set of \u2113 nodes; i..e, nodes in U . Notice that, this would not be possible for sets T in N U c with |T | = 1, since the degree of a node in T is at least \u2113+1 by virtue of the event \u03b4 > \u2113; this ensures that a single node in T is connected to at least one node in U c \\ T . Moreover, the event \u03ba = \u2113 also enforces G on to remain connected after the deletion of any \u2113 -1 nodes. Therefore, if there exists a subset U (with |U | = \u2113) such that some T in N U c is isolated in G on (U c ), then each of the \u2113 nodes in U should be connected to at least one node in T and to at least one node in U c \\ T . This can easily be seen by contradiction: Consider subsets U \u2208 N with |U | = \u2113, and T \u2208 N U c with |T | \u2265 2, such that there exists no edge between the nodes in T and the nodes in U c \\ T . Suppose there exists a node v i in U such that v i is connected to at least one node in U c \\ T but is not connected to any node in T . Then, G on can be disconnected by deleting the nodes in U \\ {v i } since there will be no edge between the nodes in T and the nodes in {v i } \u222a U c \\ T . But, |U \\ {v i }| = \u2113 -1, and this contradicts the fact that \u03ba = \u2113.\nThe inclusion\n[(\u03ba = \u2113) \u2229 (\u03b4 > \u2113)] \u2286 U\u2208N n,\u2113 , T \u2208N U c : |T |\u22652 A U,T\nis now immediate with N n,r denoting the collection of all subsets of {v 1 , . . . , v n } with exactly r elements. It is also easy to check that this union need only be taken over all subsets T of {v 1 , . . . , v n } with 2 \u2264 |T | \u2264 \u230a n-\u2113 2 \u230b. We now use a standard union bound argument to obtain\nP (\u03ba = \u2113) \u2229 (\u03b4 > \u2113) \u2229 E(J ) \u2264 U\u2208N n,\u2113 ,T \u2208N U c : 2\u2264|T |\u2264\u230a n-\u2113 2 \u230b P A U,T \u2229 E(J ) = \u230a n-\u2113 2 \u230b r=2 U\u2208N n,\u2113 ,T \u2208N U c ,r P A U,T \u2229 E(J )(147)\nwith N U c ,r denoting the collection of all subsets of U c with exactly r elements.\nFor each r = 1, . . . , n\u2113 -1, we simplify the notation by writing A \u2113,r := A {v1,...,v \u2113 },{v \u2113+1 ,...,v \u2113+r } , D \u2113,r := D {v1,...,v \u2113 },{v \u2113+1 ,...,v \u2113+r } , B \u2113,r := B {v1,...,v \u2113 },{v \u2113+1 ,...,v \u2113+r } and C r := C {v \u2113+1 ,...,v \u2113+r } . Under the enforced assumptions on the system model (viz. Section III), exchangeability yields\nP [A U,T ] = P [A \u2113,r ] , U \u2208 N n,\u2113 , T \u2208 N U c ,r\nand the expression\nU\u2208N n,\u2113 ,T \u2208N U c ,r P A U,T \u2229 E(J ) = n \u2113 n -\u2113 r P A \u2113,r \u2229 E(J ) follows since |N n,\u2113 | = n \u2113 and |N U c ,r | = n-\u2113 r .\nSubstituting into (147) we obtain the key bound\nP (\u03ba = \u2113) \u2229 (\u03b4 > \u2113) \u2229 E(J ) \u2264 \u230a n-\u2113 2 \u230b r=2 n \u2113 n -\u2113 r P A \u2113,r \u2229 E(J ) . (148\n)\nThe proof of Proposition 4 will be completed once we show\nlim n\u2192\u221e \u230a n-\u2113 2 \u230b r=2 n \u2113 n -\u2113 r P A \u2113,r \u2229 E(J ) = 0.(149)\nThe means to do so are provided in the next section.\nXII. BOUNDING PROBABILITIES P A \u2113,r \u2229 E(J )\nFirst, for r = 2, 3, . . . , n\u2113 -1, observe the equivalence\nD \u2113,r = n j=r+\u2113+1 \u222a i\u2208\u03bdr,j S i \u2229 S j = \u2205(150)\nwhere \u03bd r,j is defined via\n\u03bd r,j := {i = \u2113 + 1, \u2113 + 2, . . . , \u2113 + r : C ij }(151)\nfor each j = 1, 2, . . . , \u2113 and j = r + \u2113 + 1, r + \u2113 + 2, . . . , n. In words, \u03bd r,j is the set of indices in i = \u2113 + 1, \u2113 + 2, . . . , \u2113 + r for which v i is connected to the node v j in the communication graph G(n; p n ). Thus, the event \u222a i\u2208\u03bdr,j S i \u2229 S j = \u2205 ensures that node v j is not connected (in G on ) to any of the nodes {v \u2113+1 , . . . , v \u2113+r }. Under the enforced assumptions on the rvs S 1 , S 2 , . . . , S n , we readily obtain the expression\nP \uf8ee \uf8f0 D \u2113,r S i , i = \u2113 + 1, . . . , \u2113 + r C ij , i = \u2113 + 1, . . . , \u2113 + r, j = \u2113 + r + 1, . . . , n \uf8f9 \uf8fb = n j=r+\u2113+1 \uf8eb \uf8ed Pn-|\u222ai\u2208\u03bd r,j Si| Kn Pn Kn \uf8f6 \uf8f8 .\nIn a similar manner, we find\nP \uf8ee \uf8f0 B \u2113,r S i , i = \u2113 + 1, . . . , \u2113 + r C ij , i = 1, . . . , \u2113, j = \u2113 + 1, . . . , \u2113 + r \uf8f9 \uf8fb = \u2113 j=1 \uf8eb \uf8ed 1 - Pn-|\u222ai\u2208\u03bd r,j Si| Kn Pn Kn \uf8f6 \uf8f8 .\nIt is clear that the distributional properties of the term | \u222a i\u2208\u03bdr,j S i | will play an important role in efficiently bounding P [D \u2113,r ] and P [B \u2113,r ]. Note that it is always the case that\n| \u222a i\u2208\u03bdr,j S i | \u2265 K n 1 [|\u03bd r,j | > 0] .(152)\nAlso, on the event E(J ), we have\n| \u222a i\u2208\u03bdr,j S i | \u2265 J |\u03bdr,j| + 1 \u2022 1 [|\u03bd r,j | > 1](153)\nfor each j = r +\u2113+1, . . . , n. Finally, we note the crude bound\n| \u222a i\u2208\u03bdr,j S i | \u2264 |\u03bd r,j |K n (154\n)\nfor each j = 1, . . . , \u2113.\nConditioning on the rvs S \u2113+1 , . . . , S r+\u2113 and {C ij , i, j = \u2113 + 1, . . . , \u2113 + r} (which determine the event C r ), we conclude via (152)-(154) that\nP A \u2113,r \u2229 E(J ) = P C r \u2229 B \u2113,r \u2229 D \u2113,r \u2229 E(J ) \u2264 E \uf8ee \uf8ef \uf8ef \uf8f0 1 [C r ] \u00d7 \u2113 j=1 1 - ( Pn -Kn |\u03bd r,j | Kn ) ( Pn Kn ) \u00d7 \u00d7 n j=r+\u2113+1 ( Pn -L(\u03bd r,j ) Kn ) ( Pn Kn ) \uf8f9 \uf8fa \uf8fa \uf8fb ,\nwhere for notational convenience we have set\nL(\u03bd r,j ) = max {K n \u2022 1 [|\u03bd r,j | > 0] , (155\n) (J |\u03bdr,j | + 1) \u2022 1 [|\u03bd r,j | > 1] .\nIt is immediate that the rvs {|\u03bd r,j |} n j=r+1+\u2113 (as well as {|\u03bd r,j |} \u2113 j=1 ) are independent and identically distributed. Let \u03bd r denote a generic random variable identically distributed with \u03bd r,j , j = 1, . . . , \u2113, r + \u2113 + 1, . . . , n. Then, we have\n|\u03bd r | = st Bin(r, p n ). (156\n)\nwhere we use the notation = st to indicate distributional equality. Then, we define L(|\u03bd r |) as follows:\nL(\u03bd r ) = max K n \u2022 1 [|\u03bd r | > 0] , (J |\u03bdr | + 1) \u2022 1 [|\u03bd r | > 1] .(157)\nObserve that the event C r is independent from the set-valued random variables \u03bd r,j for each j = 1, . . . , \u2113 and for each j = r + \u2113 + 1, . . . , n. Also, as noted before {|\u03bd r,j |} n j=r+1+\u2113 (as well as {|\u03bd r,j |} \u2113 j=1 ) are independent and identically distributed. Using these we obtain\nP A \u2113,r \u2229 E(J ) \u2264 P [C r ] \u00d7 E 1 - Pn-Kn|\u03bdr | Kn Pn Kn \u2113 \u00d7 E Pn-L(\u03bdr) Kn Pn Kn n-r-\u2113 . (158\n)\nWe will give sufficiently tight bounds for each term appearing in the R.H.S. of (158). First, note from Lemma 11 (Appendix A-B) that \u2264 min e -pe(1+\u03b5/2) , e -pe\u03bbr + e -Kn\u00b5 1 [r > r n ]\nP [C r ] \u2264 r r-2 p r-1 e , r=\nfor all n sufficiently large and for each r = 2, 3, . . . , n.\nSubstituting the bounds (159), ( 161) and ( 162) into (158), and noting that each of the terms in the RHS of (158) are trivially upper bounded by 1, we obtain the key bounds on the probabilities P A \u2113,r \u2229 E(J ) that are summarized in the following Lemma. Lemma 6. With J defined in (131) for some \u03b5, \u03bb and \u00b5 in (0, 1  2 ), if Kn Pn = o(1) and p e = o(1), then the following two properties hold.\n(a) For all n sufficiently large and for each r = 2, 3, . . . , Pn-Kn 2Kn , we have\nP A \u2113,r \u2229 E(J ) \u2264 r r-2 (p e ) r-1 \u2022 (2rp e ) \u2113\n\u00d7 min e -pe(1+\u03b5/2) , e -pe\u03bbr + e -Kn\u00b5 1 [r > r n ] n-r-\u2113 .\n(b) For all n sufficiently large and for each r = 2, 3, . . . , n, we have\nP A \u2113,r \u2229 E(J ) \u2264 min r r-2 (p e ) r-1 , 1 \u00d7 min e -pe(1+\u03b5/2) , e -pe\u03bbr + e -Kn\u00b5 1 [r > r n ] n-r-\u2113 .", "publication_ref": [], "figure_ref": [], "table_ref": []}, {"heading": "XIII.

These zero-one laws are shown to improve the existing results on 1-connectivity of random key graphs with unreliable links as well as k-connectivity of random key graphs.\nAn extension of our work would be to consider a different unreliability model than the independent on/off model used here. One possible candidate is the so-called disk model [29] where two nodes have to be within a certain distance to each other to have a link in between; this induces a random geometric graph. Intersection of random key graphs with random geometric graphs has already received some interest [22], [25], but the model is proven to be difficult to analyze with results obtained thus far for its connectivity [23], [24], [43], not for k-connectivity.\nit is clear that the number of possible instances for realizing the event F is given by\nn -2 m 1 \u2022 n -m 1 -2 m 2 \u2022 n -m 1 -m 2 -2 m 3 .(206)\nThe event J defined below is an instance of F .
