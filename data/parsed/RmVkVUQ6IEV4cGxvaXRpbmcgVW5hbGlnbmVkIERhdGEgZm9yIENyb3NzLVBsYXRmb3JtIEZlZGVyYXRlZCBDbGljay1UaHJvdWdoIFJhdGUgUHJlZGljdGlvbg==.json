  "ABSTRACT": "Click-through rate (CTR) prediction plays an important role in online advertising platforms. Most existing methods use data from the advertising platform itself for CTR prediction. As user behaviors also exist on many other platforms, e.g., media platforms, it is beneficial to further exploit such complementary information for better modeling user interest and for improving CTR prediction performance. However, due to privacy concerns, data from different platforms cannot be uploaded to a server for centralized model training. Vertical federated learning (VFL) provides a possible solution which is able to keep the raw data on respective participating parties and learn a collaborative model in a privacy-preserving way. However, traditional VFL methods only utilize aligned data with common keys across parties, which strongly restricts their application scope. In this paper, we propose FedUD, which is able to exploit unaligned data, in addition to aligned data, for more accurate federated CTR prediction. FedUD contains two steps. In the first step, FedUD utilizes aligned data across parties like traditional VFL, but it additionally includes a knowledge distillation module. This module distills useful knowledge from the guest party's high-level representations and guides the learning of a representation transfer network. In the second step, FedUD applies the learned knowledge to enrich the representations of the host party's unaligned data such that both aligned and unaligned data can contribute to federated model training. Experiments on two real-world datasets demonstrate the superior performance of FedUD for federated CTR prediction.",

  "1 INTRODUCTION": "Click-through rate (CTR) prediction is one of the most central tasks in online advertising platforms [12, 31]. Most existing methods use data collected from the advertising platform itself for CTR prediction [3, 7, 12, 16, 19, 20, 22, 24, 28, 31]. As user behaviors also exist on many other platforms, e.g., media platforms, it is beneficial to further exploit such complementary information for improving CTR prediction performance [13, 25]. However, due to user privacy concerns, data from different platforms cannot be uploaded to a server for centralized model training. Vertical federated learning (VFL) provides a feasible solution which allows different participating parties to keep raw data locally but train a collaborative model in a privacy-preserving way [26]. However, traditional VFL methods only utilize aligned data with common keys across parties, which strongly restricts their application scope. In this paper, we propose FedUD, which is able to exploit unaligned data, in addition to aligned data for federated CTR prediction. For simplicity, we consider a two-party setting, where the target advertising platform serves as the host party and another media platform servers as the guest party . FedUD contains two steps. First, FedUD utilizes aligned data across parties like traditional VFL, but it additionally includes a knowledge distillation module. Second, FedUD applies the learned knowledge to enrich the representations of the host party's unaligned data. In summary, the main contributions of this paper are · Wepropose FedUD for federated CTR prediction in a privacypreserving way. FedUD is able to distill knowledge from aligned data' federated representations to enrich the host party's unaligned data' representations, such that both aligned and unaligned data can contribute to model training. · During inference, FedUD benefits not only aligned inference data (like traditional VFL methods), but also unaligned inference data because of its representation transfer ability. · We conduct experiments on two real-world datasets to evaluate the effectiveness of various methods.

  "2 PROBLEM STATEMENT": "For ease of illustration, we consider a two-party VFL setting. The host party has labels and features, and the guest party only has additional features. The two parties' samples have different feature spaces. Each sample has a key. In federated CTR prediction, the sample key could be the user's hashed device ID . VFL needs to first perform secured key intersection, e.g., private set intersection (PSI) [4, 15], to find aligned data with common keys across parties. We denote the aligned data across parties as D 𝑎 = { 𝑥 𝑎 𝐻 , 𝑦 𝑎 𝐻 , 𝑥 𝑎 𝐺 } , where { 𝑥 𝑎 𝐻 } , { 𝑦 𝑎 𝐻 } are the aligned samples and labels of the host party and { 𝑥 𝑎 𝐺 } is the aligned samples of the guest party. Traditional VFL methods utilize aligned data to train a federated model 𝑓 (D 𝑎 ) for the host party with enriched features. Wedenotetheunaligned data of the host party as D 𝑢 = { 𝑥 𝑢 𝐻 , 𝑦 𝑢 𝐻 } where { 𝑥 𝑢 𝐻 } , { 𝑦 𝑢 𝐻 } are the unaligned samples and labels. In this paper, we aim to further exploit the useful information contained in unaligned data, in addition to aligned data, to train a federated model 𝑓 (D 𝑎 , D 𝑢 ) for the host party with improved performance.",
  "3 MODEL DESIGN": "",
  "3.1 Step 1: Federated Learning using Aligned Data with Knowledge Distillation": "We illustrate this step in Figure 1(a). For privacy protection, each party has its own local models. The guest party has only a local bottom model 𝑓 𝐺 , whose aim is to extract high-level representations based on the guest party's local data. For simplicity, the guest party's local model 𝑓 𝐺 contains an embedding layer and a multilayer perceptron (MLP) with several fully-connected layers (ReLU nonlinear activation) [11]. We denote the high-level representation of the data in the guest party as  The host party has a local bottom model 𝑓 𝐻𝑏 , whose aim is to extract high-level representations based on the host party's local data. Similarly, 𝑓 𝐻𝑏 contains an embedding layer and an MLP. We denote the high-level representation of the data in the host party as  The host party has an additional top model 𝑓 𝐻𝑡 , which takes the high-level representations h 𝑎 𝐻 and h 𝑎 𝐺 as input, and produces a CTR prediction logit as  The host party's top model 𝑓 𝐻𝑡 contains a concatenation layer and an MLP. The predicted CTR is given by  So far, we only utilize aligned data but ignores possibly useful information contained in unaligned data. However, it is non-trivial to utilize unaligned data of the host party because these data do not have corresponding features in the guest party. To tackle this problem, we aim to learn a representation transfer network 𝑅𝑒𝑝 where the input is the high-level representation h 𝑎 𝐻 in the host party, and the output is e h 𝑎 𝐺 = 𝑅𝑒𝑝 ( h 𝑎 𝐻 ) which mimics the high-level representation h 𝑎 𝐺 in the guest party in certain metric. In this way, the knowledge in h 𝑎 𝐺 is distilled into e h 𝑎 𝐺 and such knowledge guides the learning of the representation transfer network. For simplicity, this network contains an MLP. In Step 1 of FedUD, we have two aims: 1) learn accurate high-level representations and 2) learn an accurate representation transfer network with knowledge distillation. To achieve the first aim, we optimize the prediction loss as follows  where 𝑌 𝑎 𝐻 = { 𝑦 𝑎 𝐻 } . To achieve the second aim, we optimize the mean squared error (MSE) loss between two representations as follows  Both 𝑙𝑜𝑠𝑠 1 and 𝑙𝑜𝑠𝑠 2 are applied only on aligned data across parties. The overall loss in Step 1 of FedUD is given by  where 𝛼 is a tunable balancing hyperparameter.

  "3.2 Step 2: Federated Learning using Both Aligned and Unaligned Data": "We illustrate this step in Figure 1(b). For unaligned data 𝑥 𝑢 𝐻 of the host party, we can only obtain the host party's representation h 𝑢 𝐻 but not the guest party's representation. This makes unaligned data useless for traditional VFL methods. Differently, we have learned a representation transfer network 𝑅𝑒𝑝 in Step 1. Although 𝑅𝑒𝑝 is learned based on aligned data, we apply it to unaligned data to infer e h 𝑢 𝐺 based on h 𝑢 𝐻 . By doing so, we can use both aligned and unaligned data for model training. For aligned data D 𝑎 = { 𝑥 𝑎 𝐻 , 𝑦 𝑎 𝐻 , 𝑥 𝑎 𝐺 } , the high-level representation of the host party and that of the guest party are given by respective local bottom models  The host party's top model then generates the predicted CTR ˆ 𝑦 𝑎 𝐻 as  For unaligned data D 𝑢 = { 𝑥 𝑢 𝐻 , 𝑦 𝑢 𝐻 } , the high-level representation of the host party is given by its local bottom model, but the highlevel representation of the guest party is given by the representation transfer network 𝑅𝑒𝑝 of the host party  The host party's top model then generates the predicted CTR ˆ 𝑦 𝑢 𝐻 as  We then optimize the prediction loss based on both aligned and unaligned data as  where 𝑌 𝑎 𝐻 = { 𝑦 𝑎 𝐻 } , 𝑌 𝑢 𝐻 = { 𝑦 𝑢 𝐻 } and 𝛽 is a tunable balancing hyperparameter. When we optimize 𝑙𝑜𝑠𝑠 3, we load the learned parameters of the representation transfer network 𝑅𝑒𝑝 and keep them frozen.",
  "3.3 Privacy": "FedUD preserves all the privacy properties of traditional VFL [26] because the guest party only sends the high-level representations h 𝑎 𝐺 of aligned data to the host party and the host party only sends the corresponding partial gradients ∇ h 𝑎 𝐺 to the guest party. No raw data is communicated between the two parties. Unaligned data of the host party is only utilized by the host party itself.",

Among these methods, DNN, Wide&Deep, DeepFM and AutoInt are local methods which use only the host party's data to train a local model. The others are VFL methods. In particular, FedSplitNN and FedCTR use only aligned data across parties. SS-VFL, FedHSSL and FedUD use both aligned and unaligned data. All the above methods are based on standard CTR features per sample.",
  "4.3 Settings": "Parameters. We set the embedding dimension as 10, the layer dimensions in the top model as {256, 128} and those in other models as {512, 256, 128}. Evaluation Metric. We use AUC and LogLoss as the evaluation metrics for CTR prediction.",
  "4.4 Experimental Results": "4.4.1 Effectiveness . In Table 2, 'overall', 'aligned' and 'unaligned' mean AUC/LogLoss is computed on all the test data, only aligned test data (which have the guest party's features) and only unaligned test data (which do not have the guest party's features) respectively. It is observed that most federated methods (e.g., FedHSSL) perform better than local methods (e.g., AutoInt) on aligned test data because of the inclusion of the guest party' features. However, most federated methods perform worse than local methods on unaligned test data because of the absence of the guest party's features. Local methods do not use the guest party's features at all. Although SSVFL and FedHSSL also exploit unaligned data, they only use such data for self-supervised learning, and thus they also do not perform well on unaligned test data.

The best result is in bold font. The second best result is underlined. A small improvement in AUC (e.g., 0.0020) can lead to a significant increase in online CTR (e.g., 3%) [3]. * indicates the statistical significance for 𝑝 ≤ 0 . 01 compared with the second best result over paired t-test.

It is observed that the AUC improvement of FedUD over DNN (a local method) on aligned data is higher than that on unaligned data. It is because aligned data have real guest party's features but unaligned data have inferred guest party's representations which are more noisy. 4.4.2 Effect of the Guest Party's Feature Slots . Figure 2 shows the overall AUCs vs. the number of the guest party's feature slots. AUCs on aligned / unaligned test data show similar trends. Due to space limitation, we omit these figures. It is observed that more guest party's feature slots generally provide useful additional information and lead to improved performance. But adding more feature slots may also include noise and possibly lead to flatten or even slightly degraded performance. 4.4.3 Effect of the Host Party's Unaligned Samples . In this experiment, we use all the aligned samples but different numbers of unaligned samples for training. Figure 3 shows the overall AUCs vs. the number of the host party's unaligned samples. The rightmost point on the x-axis denotes the maximum number of unaligned samples in the training set. It is observed that more unaligned samples generally lead to improved prediction performance. But after certain amount, the improvement becomes less obvious.",
  "5 RELATED WORK": "CTR prediction. CTR prediction has attracted lots of attention in recent years. Methods range from shallow models such as LR [18], Figure 3: Overall test AUC vs. the number of unaligned training samples. (a) Avazu dataset. (b) Industrial dataset. FM [17], Field-weighted FM [14] to deep models such as Wide & Deep [3], DeepFM [6], xDeepFM [10], AutoInt [20] and DIL [29]. These methods are based on standard CTR features per sample. Some other methods exploit auxiliary information. DIN [31] and DIEN [30] consider user historical click behaviors. BERT4CTR [23] considers pre-trained language model information. All these methods are centralized, which process all the data in a central server. Vertical federated learning (VFL). VFL provides a feasible solution for cross-platform federated CTR prediction. It is able to keep the raw data locally and learn a collaborative model in a privacy-preserving way [9, 26, 27]. However, FedSplitNN [8] and FedCTR [25] only utilize aligned data with common keys across parties, which strongly restricts their application scope. SS-VFL [1] and FedHSSL [8] exploit both aligned and unaligned data, but they only use unaligned data for local self-supervised learning. Differently, FedUD proposed in this paper explicitly transfers knowledge learned from cross-party aligned data to unaligned data. FedUD is thus able to benefit both aligned and unaligned inference data.",
