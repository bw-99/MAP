Meanwhile, benefited from the deployment of intelligent transportation systems, traditional transportation conditions are enhanced through the applications of diverse technologies to vehicle infrastructures. The cooperative element in C-ITS is expected to significantly improve road safety, traffic efficiency, and comfort of driving.\nTo enable this cooperative awareness, vehicles broadcast beacon messages that rely on kinematic data like position and velocity.

Despite the availability of alternative approaches, academia, industry and standardization development organizations such as IEEE and ETSI have agreed to adopt the pseudonyms approach to protect the vehicles' location privacy [1].\nThe legacy ad-hoc pseudonyms management approaches [1] enable adversaries that eavesdrop on all traffic throughout an area to track the vehicles' trajectories. Eavesdropped messages can be correlated with specific vehicles or even drivers based on reoccurring travel patterns, e.g., commuting trips. The latter is referred to as pseudonyms linking attacks. Two types of linking attacks have been identified: syntactic and semantic linking. The syntactic linking occurs when the attacker tends to break the vehicle privacy through linking its identifiers or pseudonyms by \"joining the dots\" between two heartbeat messages with the same identifier. The semantic linking, also known as identity revealing attack, is more powerful because it is based on the attacker knowledge of the message content to link the pseudonyms [1].\nTo mitigate the linking attacks associated with the current pseudonyms management scheme, different approaches have been suggested in the literature, of which the most significant works are: frequent update of pseudonyms, synchronization of pseudonym change [2], the introduction of a radio silence period before the pseudonyms update [2,3], and the encryption of pseudonyms [4]. Further analysis proved that the silence period approach is more effective than the pseudonyms encryption [1]. Compared to the encryption technique [1], the radio silence provides effective protection against both internal and external passive adversaries, since no safety message is provided to the adversary during the radio silence. On the other hand, with the encryption approach, anyone possessing the credentials can decrypt the intercepted messages. Additionally, equipping vehicles with multiple pseudonyms to enable frequent update of pseudonyms, if concurrent use is not restricted, might allow malicious actors to spoof multiple independent vehicles and conduct a sybil attack. For example, a malicious vehicle can attempt to gain free roads by faking a traffic jam.\nWhile vehicles anonymity is desirable, it conflicts with authorities' wish to ensure accountability and non-repudiation. To address the complex relationship between application requirements, privacy protection, anonymity, authentication, accountability, and non-repudiation requirements, efforts have been made to improve pseudonyms management schemes that aim to balance these divergent requirements [1]. Nevertheless, the drawbacks of the existing approaches raise a valid question on their effectiveness and the level of achievable location privacy protection. The most significant issues are concerning the safety-privacy trade-off. For instance, the work in [2] suggests executing the radio silence-based strategy in places where the impact on road safety is minimal such as regions with widespread road infrastructure [4]. However, many challenges still exist concerning the impact of privacy-preserving measures on the efficiency of disseminating the safety messages, scalability, and communication overhead [1].", "publication_ref": ["b0", "b0", "b0", "b1", "b1", "b2", "b3", "b0", "b0", "b0", "b1", "b3", "b0"], "figure_ref": [], "table_ref": []}, {"heading": "Problem Statement and Contributions", "text": "Hybrid vehicular communications using different radio technologies and channels are introduced to overcome the shortfalls of ad-hoc communication and increase the channel throughput and reliability. Cellular-V2X (C-V2X) radio technology considers the implementation in different broadband cellular network generations, i.e., LTE-V in 4G and future generations such as 5G. The 5G network in particular, not only is envisioned to enhance the vehicular communication speed and reliability, but also is expected to improve the clock synchronization and the location accuracy (in the order of 1 meter or below) [5].\nThe 5G system architecture presents an integral change in network architecture. For instance, the introduced Service-Based Architecture (SBA) improves the modularity of the network system where the control plane functionality and common data repositories of a 5G network are represented by a set of interconnected Network Functions (NFs), each with authorization to access each other's services. The SBA allows any third-party application, referred to by 3GPP as Application Function (AF), to interact with the NFs in a secured manner. Hence, it paves the way for more advanced vehicular applications and protocols with security and privacy-preserving features.\nTo limit pseudonyms linking attacks, in current ETSI standards [6], it is required that each V2X application uses its identifiers that cannot be linked to each other. In particular, DENM and CAM originating from the same vehicle should not be linkable. Accordingly, different pseudonyms should be assigned to the different applications, even associated with the same ITS-S.\nETSI security concept uses long-term certificates for identification and accountability of ITS-S, named Enrolment Certificates (EC) and short-lived, anonymized certificates for V2V/V2I communications, named Authorization Tickets (AT) [6]. A User Equipment (UE) or an ITS-S requires authorization tickets for accessing 5G network services. These authorization tickets have a time validity and are frequently changed. Accordingly, the current ETSI pseudonym management approach relies on the authorization tickets to pseudonymize the ITS-S identity while proving it is authenticated and authorized to access communication resources and services. Efforts have been made by researchers and standardization organizations such as ETSI [6] and SAE [7] to define pseudonyms life-cycle parameters, pseudonyms metrics and update strategies. However, many unresolved issues and open questions still exist.\nThe contribution of this work is twofold: Firstly, we provide a detailed description of the 5G basic architecture while joining some dots concerning its application in the ITS domain. We present, for the first time, a detailed end-to-end technical overview of the V2X 5G-enabled approach to achieving pseudonimity starting from the vehicle's initial registration with the network phase. We further discuss the 5G security procedures with a focus on authentication and services authorization. Secondly, we discuss the 5G-related unresolved pseudonyms management challenges and suggest recommendations and possible solutions to address these challenges.", "publication_ref": ["b4", "b5", "b5", "b5", "b6"], "figure_ref": [], "table_ref": []}, {"heading": "Background", "text": "The 5G System architecture brings transformational changes to the core network by improving the modularity of the network system. One key advancement is upgrading the traditional network architecture to Service-Based Architecture (SBA), as shown in Figure 2. Each NF provides a set of services, through a service-based interface that is consumed by other authorized NFs.\nAn NF service is one type of capability exposed by an NF (NF Service Producer) to other authorized NF (NF Service Consumer) through a service-based interface. The interaction between the consumer and producer takes place within the Service Framework (SF). The SF consists of service registration, service authorization and service discovery. A Service Producer needs to register itself to be visible to consumers. The service authorization ensures the consumer is authorized to access the service provided by the service provider. Finally, the service discovery enables a consumer to discover NF instance(s) that provide the required service(s).\nThe Network Repository Function (NRF) is the NF of the core network that provides a single record of all network functions (NF) available in a given mobile network, together with their profiles and the services they support. It receives an NF's registration and discovery requests, maintains profiles, and acts as an authorization server where NF Service Consumers can request an OAuth2 [8] token to access the services offered by the designated NF Service Producers.

The Enrolment (registration) process is the main access control to the ITS. The ITS-S requests its enrolment certificate from the Enrolment Authority (EA). The enrolled ITS-S receives an Enrollment Certificate (EC) which grants it permission to gain authorization for the use of further services. During enrollment, the network performs a primary authentication procedure and provide the keying material to be used between the ITS-S and the serving network in subsequent security procedures. During the primary authentication and key agreement procedure, the serving network authenticates the UE permanent cellular identity, namely the UE Subscription Permanent Identifier (SUPI), which is tied to the subscriber's (U)SIM card [9].\nA major improvement in the 5G authentication procedure is adding the home network's public key to the primary authentication process. With the subscriber UE having the home network's public key stored in the USIM, it can start encrypting sensitive authentication data, e.g., the SUPI, right from the beginning of the authentication process [10].\nFor an enrolled and authenticated ITS-S to use ITS applications, it should receive cryptographically signed certificates known as the Authorization Tickets (AT) from the Authorization Authority (AA). The ATs guarantee that the requesting ITS-S has the permission to use the requested services. Different variants for the authorization process are defined in the ETSI Standardization documents [6].

Trusted applications reside in the trusted data network and use the Network Repository Function (NRF) to communicate with the core network. On the other hand, untrusted applications rely on the Network Exposure Function (NEF) for communications with the control plane services to protect the core network.\nThe 5G system enables Mobile Network Operators (MNO) to (de)authorize UEs and IoT devices to use mobile network services. Accordingly, the 5G system provides means to verify whether a UE is authorized to access a specific service before establishing a direct device connection with the Service Producer NF [11].

We assume adversaries can leverage the ITS infrastructure and RSU in addition to adversarial deployed units. We further consider internal adversaries that are authenticated members of the network as well as external adversaries. Finally, we take into consideration both passive and active adversaries.

The SAE for instance recommends updating the pseudonym at startup and then every 5 minutes [6]. The pseudonym change should be accompanied by a silence period to confuse potential eavesdroppers.\nThe C2C-Communication Consortium approach relies on making location linking infeasible by dividing any road trip into three segments and recommend changing the pseudonym at least once per segment. The first pseudonym change is initiated at the beginning of a trip, the second change should be performed during the trip randomly with 800m -1500 m from the start of the trip. Subsequent pseudonyms re-allocation is performed at least 800 m from the last pseudonym change and within an additional interval of 2 -6 minutes [14].\nTo avoid link-ability, the ETSI and SAE recommend changing all the IDs of the communication stack, including the IPv6 address, synchronously with each pseudonym update. The latter necessitates blocking the emission of messages to avoid revealing some of the stack identities during the update process. Since the pseudonym update process induces additional latency, it is recommended that the latency should be less than 100 ms which is the maximum CAM frequency to avoid impacting any ongoing safety applications [6]. While we do not provide numerical studies in this paper, we highlight the following trade-offs and provide suggestions and guidelines to be accounted for during the pseudonyms reallocation process:\n\u2022 The pseudonyms update should be synchronized using clock synchronization between the vehicles to complicate the syntactic linking attacks. In fact, the impact of synchronization on the enhancing the network resilience to linking attacks highly depends on the synchronization accuracy as well as the number of synchronized vehicles. The improved 5G clock synchronization can be used to improve synchronization accuracy and broaden its scope. GPS synchronization is an alternative, however, it is affected by bad weather and cannot be received in tunnels or near tall buildings [4].", "publication_ref": ["b5", "b12", "b5", "b3"], "figure_ref": [], "table_ref": []}, {"heading": "\u2022", "text": "After concurrently changing their pseudonyms, it is recommended that vehicles go in a silence period and stop sending messages to confuse eavesdroppers and prevent them from tracking the newly acquired pseudonyms.

These preconditions can result into two possible situations namely ghost vehicles and missing vehicles [6]. In the ghost vehicle case, the neighboring vehicles still have the vehicle initial ID in their Local Dynamic Map (LDM) and assume that the new ID belongs to a new vehicle. Accordingly, they will keep the two records and consider them two different vehicles. While the missing vehicle case is usually caused by the silence period when the vehicles seize messages emission and disappear from the neighbors' LDM. Subsequent to the expiry of the silence period, the vehicle starts sending messages again, hence suddenly becomes visible to its neighbors which may render sudden evasion reactions leading to unsafe situations.\nTo address the above issues, we suggest that vehicles notify their neighbors to delete the old pseudonym prior to starting the silence period. The difficulty of linking the new pseudonyms to vehicles identity depends on the number of vehicles updating their pseudonyms simultaneously. Clearly, it will have an explicit impact on the standardization because new signaling element of \"pseudonym deactivation\" needs to be defined for such notifications from the initiator vehicles to its neighbors.

In such situations, initiating a pseudonym update may induce uncertainty and impact road safety, especially if it is followed by a silence period. Hence, the pseudonym lock is introduced through SN-ID-LOCK service with a maximum period of 255 seconds [6]. However, the fact that there is no limit for the amount of time an application can renew the lock might render the pseudonym traceable. To mitigate this privacy risk, ETSI recommends differentiating between legitimate applications and 3rd party applications. The former should be authorized to lock the pseudonym change as long as necessary whereas the latter should not. However, in some situations, even legitimate applications can be misled, such as in the case of the ghost neighbor situation motioned earlier, and can be tricked into requesting a lock renewal. As an attempt to limit the infinite pseudonyms locking, the related ETSI standard recommends to specify a maximum SN-ID-LOCK time of 15 min in order to prevent infinite pseudonym change locks [6]. It should be noted that the lock should not be renewed beyond the validity time of the pseudonym.\nIn case of dense networks, when no intermediate action of the vehicle is required, other neighbors can relay the safety messages and the vehicle can safely change its pseudonym. To make such a call, the decision maker must have a global view of the network. Hence, we suggest that a threshold should be adjusted to limit the number or lock request made by a certain application and granted by the security layer. After the threshold is attained, further requests should be validated by the serving network. Regarding the standardization, it means that we need to explicitly set a maximum number of lock requests in the specifications. Further, a mechanism to reset the number of lock requests needs to be defined in the security layer.

To mitigate the risk of misuse of concurrent pseudonyms, ETSI recommends minimising the number of concurrently valid pseudonym certificates for each ITS-S with a minimum value of 2 in order to allow dynamic timing for pseudonym change.\nFurther questions that arise in this context are: should pseudonyms reuse be allowed? If yes, what would be the impact on the ITS-S pseudonymity? While we recommend against the reuse of pseudonyms because, if not carefully managed, it might enable vehicles tracking, this decision highly depends on the pool size. Other considerations should be accounted for include the cost of pseudonym change in light of the pseudonym management design and frequency of updating the pseudonyms.\nHaving a pool of pseudonyms requires further considerations to manage the selection scheme of the next pseudonyms.
