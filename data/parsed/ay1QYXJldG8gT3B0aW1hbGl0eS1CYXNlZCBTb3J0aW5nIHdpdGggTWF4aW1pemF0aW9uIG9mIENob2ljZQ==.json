We formulate this problem in a very abstract form and prove that sorting by k-Pareto optimality yields a valid solution. Next, we show that the proposed theory can be useful in practice.

Knuth, 1997]  here means the process of sorting a set of items with respect to a preference or dominance relation. We use the terms preference and dominance interchangeably. 2 We use the terms item and element interchangeably.", "sections": [{"heading": "Introduction", "text": "In the modern era of information overload, the task of choosing a subset of the most useful items is extremely important. Various tools were developed with the aim to assist a user with this task, for example, text search engines [Croft et al., 2010] and recommender systems [Resnick and Varian, 1997]. In most of the cases, such systems suggest to the user a small set of elements 2 . Thereby, if the number of equally preferable options is large, a heuristic is used to discard a fraction of them. However, in some applications the user might be willing to analyze all equally preferable options with the aim to choose the best one. This can happen, for example, in the case of choosing a habitation.\nA similar problem of choosing a subset of most preferable elements also arises as an important step when solving various practical tasks. A straightforward example would be the selection step in genetic optimization algorithms [Mitchell, 1998]. At this step, a subset of the current population is chosen to advance to the next generation. Having the chosen subset made up of elements with large fitness values guides the evolution process in the desired direction. At the same time, selecting a subset with the largest variety of genes ensures variability of characteristics and allows faster exploration of the search space.\nThese examples bring us to the problem of generalizedfoot_0 topological sorting with choice maximisation which we also refer to as maximum choice problem. This problem aims to choose a subset of a predefined maximum size, consisting of most preferable items and containing the largest number of equally preferred elementsfoot_1 . To the best of our knowledge, this problems has not yet been studied in the literature. In this text, we propose a theoretical solution to the maximum choice problem and demonstrate how both the problem and its solution can be applied in practice.\nThe contributions of this work are the following:\n1. We formulate the maximum choice problem in a broad sense for arbitrary elements, preference relations R, and measures \u00b5 indicating the set sizes, see Section 2.\n2. We propose a solution based on the concept of k-Pareto optimality, whose definition relies on the relation R, see Section 3.\n3. We further investigate the proposed solution from a theoretical point of view and discover interesting characteristics, such as the relationship between k-Pareto optimal elements and the arc of hyperbola, see Section 4.\n4. Finally, we demonstrate the applicability of our approach to real-world problems by considering genetic optimization, see Section 5.", "publication_ref": ["b1", "b39"], "figure_ref": [], "table_ref": []}, {"heading": "Sorting with Choice Maximization", "text": "To formally define the problem of maximization of choice, we introduce several definitions in Sections 2.1 and 2.2.

However, this generality allows discovering novel connections and applying the developed theory to numerous practical problems. We also illustrate the defined concepts with an example in Section 2.3.", "publication_ref": [], "figure_ref": [], "table_ref": []}, {"heading": "Definitions", "text": "We consider a set X with a binary relation R. Intuitively xRy means that x is preferable to y. The case xRy and not yRx means that x is strictly preferable to y. This situation is denoted by xR * y. We also consider a positive and \u03c3-finite measure \u00b5 [Halmos, 2013] defined on X. Thus, we have a measure space (X, \u03a3, \u00b5), where \u03a3 is a set of subsets of X, and \u00b5 intuitively indicates the size of these subsets. To ensure measurability, throughout this text the characteristic function 1 R of the relation R is assumed to be sufficiently regular 5 . The \u00b5 can be defined in different ways. Important examples are the counting measure and probability measures P . Depending on the definition of \u00b5, it can indicate the following characteristics of the elements in X: how many?, how likely?, how important?, or what volume?\nTo illustrate these definitions, we consider the following example. Let X be a set of possible habitations of which the user has to choose the best according to his preferences encoded by the relation R. In such a situation, the relation R can be multidimensional. Let us assume, for simplicity, that an optimal habitation for the user is close to a given location, for example, his workplace (relation R l ), is situated in a district with a smaller population size (relation R p ), and is close to a river (relation R r ). Thus, the user's preferences can be represented by the preorder relation R = R l &R p &R r . In our example, all available habitations from X can be mapped onto points in a 3dimensional space of Proximity to the location \u00d7 Population \u00d7 River. The fact that R is a preorder rela-5 1R is equal to 1 if xRy and is equal to 0 otherwise.\ntion means that some elements of X can be comparable, while others not. For example, the habitation x with coordinates (50, 100, T rue) is strictly preferable to y with coordinates (60, 100, T rue), that is xR * y.\nAt the same time, the habitation z with coordinates (40, 100, F alse) is incomparable with x. Indeed, z is better with respect to R l , it is situated closer to the required location, but x is better with respect to R r , as the latter is situated near a river.\nHaving the task to find a subset of X that is 'best' according to R, a rational solution can be formulated with the following recursive expression: if an element x is selected, then all elements that are strictly preferable to x should be also selected. In our example, this translates into the task of finding a subset of habitations S R that might be suitable for the user. Naturally, if y \u2208 S R , then x \u2208 S R as the latter corresponds better to the preferences of the user defined by the relation R. We formalize this rationality condition by defining selections as follows.\nDefinition 1. A selection S is a subset of X such that x \u2208 S and yR * x implies y \u2208 S. The set of all selections in \u03a3 is denoted by Sfoot_2 .", "publication_ref": [], "figure_ref": [], "table_ref": []}, {"heading": "The Maximum Choice Problem", "text": "As discussed in Section 1, in practical applications when selecting a subset of X one might want not only to respect the above rationality constraint, but also to maximize the number of incomparable pairs. The latter condition is equivalent to the maximization of the diversity of the selected subset, or the maximization of the provided choice. In our example with habitations, if both x and z are presented to the user, then he can choose an appropriate habitation by himselffoot_3 .\nIn terms of our notations, this will be translated into the condition of selecting as many pairs x, y such that neither x is strictly preferable to y (\u00acxR * y) nor y is strictly preferable to x (\u00acyR * x). This means that there is freedom of choice between x and y (xRy = yRx). This motivates the following quantitative definition of choice for measurable subsets of X.\nDefinition 2. Choice offered by a set A is the number\ncho(A) = (\u00b5 \u00d7 \u00b5)({(x, y) \u2208 A 2 |xRy = yRx}).\nThe choice offered by a measurable set A essentially measures how many pairs of items offering choice can be extracted from A. Additionally, if one wants to restrict the size of the selected subset, in our example, to present to the user a small set of suitable habitations with \u00b5(S R ) \u2264 m, then this leads us to the definition of the maximum choice problem: Maximum Choice Problem. For a given m find all selections T such that cho(T ) = max S\u2208S,\u00b5(S)\u2264m cho(S).\nAny such selection T will be said to offer maximum choice for m.\nIn practical applications, it might be more insightful to consider the concept of diversity that is functionally related to the concept of choice. Definition 3. For any measurable set A, the diversity of A is the ratio div(A) = cho(A)/\u00b5(A) 2 .\nThus div(A) is the likelihood that there is choice between the two randomly chosen elements. The main ingredient of our solution to the maximum choice problem is the following concept. Definition 4. The k-Pareto optimality of an element x \u2208 X is the measure of the subset of X containing all elements strictly preferable to x:\npo(x) = \u00b5({y|yR * x}).\nIf \u00b5 is the probability measure, the k-Pareto optimality of an element x, po(x), is the likelihood an element drawn at random from X is strictly preferable to x.\nFinally, we introduce the sets of at least k-Pareto optimal elements. Such sets consist of all elements in X with po \u2264 k. In Section 3 we show that this concept yields a solution for the maximum choice problem. Definition 5. The at least k-Pareto optimal elements T k form the measurable set defined as follows:\nT k = {x \u2208 X| po(x) \u2264 k} 8 .", "publication_ref": [], "figure_ref": [], "table_ref": []}, {"heading": "Example", "text": "In this subsection, we discuss an illustrative example to demonstrate the concepts defined in Sections 2.1 and 2.2. Let us consider a finite subset X of R 2 , counting measure \u00b5, and the relation R defined as follows:\n(x 1 , x 2 )R (y 1 , y 2 ) iff x 1 \u2264 y 1 and x 2 \u2264 y 2 , see Fig. 1.\nIn economics, x is Pareto optimal if there is no y in X such that xR * y. In our language, this means that po(x) = 0. Thus, k-Pareto optimality indicates how much an element is away from being Pareto optimal.\nLet X be comprised of six points presented in Fig. 2. As we are considering the counting measure, \u00b5(X) = 6.  Sorting the set X by k-Pareto optimality of its elements will produce the following result: ({A, B, C}, {E}, {D, F }). This sorting is different from sorting by Pareto fronts. The latter approach is widely used in practice and is the basis of all Pareto dominance-based genetic optimization algorithms [Li et al., 2015]. Sorting by Pareto fronts is done in the following way. First, the first Pareto front, which is the set of non-dominated points, is identified. Next, the points from this front are removed from the consideration and the process is repeated until all points are assigned to a front. Sorting the points from Fig. 2 \nk that \u00b5(T k ) = m.\nWe prove the above stated theorem in several steps. First, we show that for selections the computation of choice can be simplified. It only requires to compute a simple integral instead of a double integral.\nIntegral Formula. If S is a measurable selection and \u00b5(S) < +\u221e, then\ncho(S) = S (\u00b5(S) -2 po(x))d\u00b5(x).(1)\nProof. The fact that set S is a selection means that \u2200y \u2208 S : {x \u2208 S|xR * y} = {x \u2208 X|xR * y}. That is, any element x from X strictly preferable to any element y in S, also belong to S (x \u2208 S). Using the definition of choice from Def. 2 and \u00b5(S) < +\u221e we obtain\ncho(S) = \u00b5(S) 2 -2(\u00b5 \u00d7 \u00b5)({(x, y) \u2208 S 2 |xR * y}) = \u00b5(S) 2 -2(\u00b5 \u00d7 \u00b5)({(x, y) \u2208 S \u00d7 X|yR * x}).\nFubini's theorem [Halmos, 2013] indicates that\n(\u00b5\u00d7\u00b5)({(x, y) \u2208 S \u00d7 X|yR * x} = = S X 1 R * d(\u00b5(y)) d\u00b5(x) = S po(x)d\u00b5(x),\nwhere 1 R * is the characteristic function of R *foot_5 .\nFinally, the integral formula results from the fact that \u00b5(S) 2 -2 S po(x)d\u00b5(x) = S (\u00b5(S) -2 po(x))d\u00b5(x).\nLet's now consider the function c defined on \u03a3 for any A of finite measure by\nc(A) = A (\u00b5(A) -2 po(x))d\u00b5(x).\nThe integral formula defined in Eq. ( 1) means that for any selection S, we have c(S) = cho(S). The second step of our proof of Theorem 1 is to show that T k is the largest measurable set that maximizes c for its respective measure. More precisely, we will prove the following lemma. Lemma 1. For any k such as \u00b5(T k ) < +\u221e we have\nc(T k ) = max A\u2208\u03a3,\u00b5(A)\u2264\u00b5(T k ) c(A). Moreover, if \u00b5(A) \u2264 \u00b5(T k ) and c(A) = c(T k ), then A \u2286 T k almost-everywhere.\nThe context of this lemma is very similar to the knapsack problem [Martello, 1990]. In this problem, one needs to find a subset A of a finite set of items {x 1 , ..., x n } maximizing the total value \u03a3 xi\u2208A v(x i ) under the constraint that the total weight \u03a3 xi\u2208A w(x i ) of A does not exceed a predefined maximum weight w * .\nIn Lemma 1, the total value is c(A), the ratio of an element's value to its weight becomes \u00b5(A)-2 po(x), and the weight constraint is expressed as \u00b5(A) \u2264 \u00b5(T k ).\nThe solutions given by the lemma correspond to those yielded for the knapsack problem by George Dantzig's greedy approximation algorithm [Dantzig, 1957]. This algorithm consists of ordering elements by decreasing value-to-weight ratio and then taking the N first elements. N is chosen in such a way, that taking one more element would cause excessive weight. The process of proving Lemma 1 is similar to proving that George Dantzig's solutions are optimal for their respective weights.\nProof of Lemma 1. Let's consider T k such that \u00b5(T k ) < +\u221e. To prove c(T k ) is the maximum, we need to show for any\nA \u2208 \u03a3, that c(A) \u2264 c(T k ) if \u00b5(A) \u2264 \u00b5(T k ). As A = (A \u2229 T k ) \u222a (A \\ T k ) and T k = (A \u2229 T k ) \u222a (T k \\ A), requiring c(A) \u2264 c(T k ) is equivalent to requiring A\\T k (\u00b5(A)-2 po(x))d\u00b5(x) \u2264 T k \\A (\u00b5(T k )-2 po(x))d\u00b5(x).\n(2) By definition of T k , we have that po\n(x) > k for x \u2208 A \\ T k , while po(x) \u2264 k for x \u2208 T k \\ A. Therefore, A\\T k (\u00b5(A) -2 po(x))d\u00b5(x) \u2264 \u00b5(A \\ T k )(\u00b5(A) -2k),\n(3) and\nT k \\A (\u00b5(T k ) -2 po(x))d\u00b5(x) \u2265 \u00b5(T k \\ A)(\u00b5(T k ) -2k). (4) The constraint \u00b5(A) \u2264 \u00b5(T k ) means that \u00b5(A \\ T k ) \u2264 \u00b5(T k \\ A). Thus, we have \u00b5(A \\ T k )(\u00b5(A) -2k) \u2264 \u00b5(T k \\ A)(\u00b5(T k ) -2k). (5)\nFinally, combining Eq. ( 5) with Eq. (3) and Eq. ( 4) guarantees the inequality in Eq. ( 2) under the constraint \u00b5(A) \u2264 \u00b5(T k ).\nLet us now consider A \u2208 \u03a3 such that \u00b5(A) \u2264 \u00b5(T k ) and c(A) = c(T k ). We now proceed to show that A \u2286 T k almost everywhere. If c(A) = c(T k ), the inequality in Eq. ( 2) must be an equality. Under the assumption \u00b5(A) \u2264 \u00b5(T k ), we again have the inequalities in Eq. (3), Eq. ( 4) and Eq. ( 5), which must be equalities if Eq. ( 2) is an equality. However, because po(x) > k for x \u2208 A \\ T k , the inequality in Eq. ( 3) can only become an equality if \u00b5(A \\ T k ) = 0. Now everything is in place to prove the theorem.\nProof of Theorem 1. Let us first prove that the at least k-Pareto optimal elements T k offer maximum choice. Lemma 1 says that on \u03a3 the set T k maximises c for its respective measure. We assumed T k is a selection. At the same time, for any selection c = cho. It means that T k offers maximum choice for its respective measure. Moreover, from Lemma 1 and from S \u2286 \u03a3 directly results that if a selection A offers maximum choice for \u00b5(T k ), then A \u2286 T k almost everywhere.\nThe theorem does not guarantee uniqueness. For example, in the case of the relation \u2264 on R and the Lebesgue measure, selections are all left-unbounded intervals and the choice of any selection is 0. However, if for any selection\nA \u2282 T k & \u00b5(A) < \u00b5(T k ) =\u21d2 cho(A) < cho(T k ), (6)\nthen T k is a unique maximum. This is a direct consequence from the fact that T k contains any other selection offering maximum choice for \u00b5(T k ) < +\u221e. Also, the proof of the theorem indicates that transitivity is not necessary. The set T k is only required to be a selection. This is the case for Lebesgue area measure and the non-transitive relation R defined on the unit square by (\nx 1 , x 2 )R (y 1 , y 2 ) iff y1 2 \u2264 x 1 \u2264 y 1 and y2 2 \u2264 x 2 \u2264 y 2 . The sets T k fulfill the requirement of be- ing selections if R * satisfies the weakened transitivity condition xR * y =\u21d2 po(x) \u2264 po(y).\nIt is possible to prove that for the counting measure, finite sets, and partial order relations, all selections offering maximum choice can be obtained when sorting by k-Pareto optimality and taking the first l elements. However, for discrete measures with nonconstant weights the above construction might not yield all selections offering maximum choice. A relative example is given in Fig. 3. The partial order relation represented by its Hasse diagram. [Davey and Priestley, 2002]. The set S is not of the form with A \u2286 T k \\ T * k . Nevertheless, it offers maximum choice for m = 3.\nT * k \u222a A \u2022 (1, 1) \u2022 (1, 1) \u2022 (1, 0) \u2022 (4, 0) S", "publication_ref": ["b29", "b5"], "figure_ref": ["fig_1", "fig_1", "fig_2"], "table_ref": []}, {"heading": "Further Theoretical Explorations", "text": "", "publication_ref": [], "figure_ref": [], "table_ref": []}, {"heading": "Efficient Computation of Choice", "text": "Computation of choice may be simplified by performing the change of variable y = po(x) in the integral formula (1).\nProposition 1.

Marginas of X 1 and X 2 are fully described by the marginal cumulative probability distributions F 1 and F 2 , whereas the copula describes the dependence structure between X 1 and X 2 . The copula can be considered as a joint cumulative distribution function having two uniform marginal distributions on [0, 1].

For a continuous random vector (X 1 , X 2 ) and the relation R \u2126 , k-Pareto optimality, choice, diversity and selections offering maximum choice only depend on the copula C of X 1 , X 2 .\nProof. Let us consider the mapping\nG : \u2126 \u2192 [0, 1] 2 , \u03c9 x \u2192 (F 1 (x 1 ), F 2 (x 2 )).\nWe consider R \u2126 and P defined on \u2126.

The map G preserves probabilities in the sense that for any measurable A in \u2126 we have (G * P )(G(A)) = P (A). Moreover, G preserves the relations in the sense that xR \u2126 y iff G(x)R G(y). Selections are preserved in the sense that if S is a selection for R \u2126 , then G(S) is a selection for R . Ignoring negligible subsets, this mapping between selections is one-to-one. Therefore, G also preserves selections, k-Pareto optimality, choice, and diversity.\nThe proposition finally results from the fact that G * P only depends on the copula. This is a consequence of the fact that for any (a 1 , a 2 ) \u2208 [0, 1] 2 , we have\n(G * P )([0, a 1 ] \u00d7 [0, a 2 ]) = C(a 1 , a 2 ).\nThis equality is a result of the following statements: 1) continuity which guarantees that a 1 and a 2 can be written as F 1 (x 1 ) and F 2 (x 2 ) for some appropriate x 1 and x 2 ; 2) the definition of image measure; 3) the fact that G = (F 1 , F 2 ) \u2022 (X 1 , X 2 ); and 4) the equality\nF (x 1 , x 2 ) = C(F 1 (x 1 ), F 2 (x 2 )).\nProposition 3. If X 1 and X 2 are two continuous independent random variables, then for the relation\nR \u2126 P (T k ) = k -k ln(k), cho(T k ) = (k -k ln(k)) 2 -k 2 1 2 -ln k .\nProof. Let us again consider the map G. The image measure G * P induced by G on [0, 1] 2 is the Lesbegue area measure.

However, the total number of linear extensions exponentially increases with n, and the resulting algorithms are complex and slow [de Loof, 2010, p. 48]. For example, random sampling of linear extensions has an expected running time of O(n 3 log n) [Huber, 2006]. Below we show that sorting by k-Pareto optimality offers an efficient alternative.\nThe basic algorithm for the k-Pareto optimality based sorting is straightforward. In the case of an arbitrary relation R, po(x) is computed by summing up the measures of the items that are strictly preferable to x. This requires one pass through the whole set X for every element x \u2208 X with computation complexity O(n 2 ). The complexity of sorting X by increasing values of po is O(n log n). Therefore, the total computational complexity is O(n 2 ).\nThe case of composite relations defined on the probability space allows constructing even faster sorting procedures. We illustrate this idea for R = R l &R p &R r from our housings example. We define the component relations as follows: for i \u2208 {l, r, p}, aR i b iff X i (a) \u2264 X i (b), where the real valued random variable X l represents proximity to the location, X p represents population size, and X r (x) is 0 when x is close to a river and 1 otherwise.

The computation complexity of estimating Fi is O(n log n). This needs to be done for every component relation R i , resulting in the total complexity of O(n log n).", "publication_ref": [], "figure_ref": [], "table_ref": []}, {"heading": "Application to Genetic Optimization", "text": "In Section 1, we hypothesized that sorting with choice maximization can be beneficial for genetic optimization. Indeed, this strategy results in the maximization of the population diversity and allows exploring the search space more efficiently. Additionally, Pareto dominance-based many-objective 12 genetic optimiza-tion algorithms are known to suffer from the lack of selection pressure [Palakonda et al., 2018]. When the number of objectives increases, the number of incomparable solutions grows exponentially. However, as shown in Section 4.2, sorting random independent vectors by their Pareto optimality can be considered as a liner extension of the defined preference relation. The fact that P (po(x) = po(y)) = 0 means that such sorting rarely produces ties and for any two solutions either x is preferable to y or vice versa. In the rest of this subsection, we demonstrate that the proposed approach indeed improves the performance of genetic algorithms in the case of independent objectives.\nTo evaluate the proposed sorting procedure, we use it in NSGA-II instead of Pareto dominance-based sorting. We experiment with two measures \u00b5: counting and probability measures. This gives us two versions of genetic algorithms referred to as PO-count and PO-prob respectively. These algorithms are compared with implementations of the state-of-the-art algorithms NSGA-II and NSGA-III [Deb and Jain, 2013] from the deap python library 13 . For the experimental evaluation, we use the 0/1 knapsack problem with independent objectives as defined in [Zitzler and Thiele, 1999]. The number of knapsacks (objectives) is varied within the following set n k \u2208 {2 -8, 10, 15, 25} and the number of items is set to 250. We adopt random selection with replacement and uniform crossover with mutation probability 0.01. We set the population size to 250 and the number of generations to 500. All results are the average among 30 independent runs.\nBelow we analyze the performance of different algorithms in terms of the classical hypervolume metric [Shang et al., 2020] with the origin of coordinates as a reference point. In our setup, this metric is to be maximized. We choose NSGA-II as the baseline, and present the relative changes in the hypervolume indicator for the rest of the algorithms in Fig. 7 (increase: positive number, decrease: negative number). We notice that despite having been developed for the manyobjective optimization, NSGA-III almost always results in lower values of hypervolume, even for a large number of knapsacks. This confirms a similar observation from [Ishibuchi et al., 2016], and supports our choice of NSGA-II as a baseline for implementation and comparison instead of NSGA-III. Further, we see that the value of relative increase for PO-count is always very close to 0. It means that PO-count yields a population covering the same hypervolume as NSGA-II. Contrarily, PO-prob improves the hypervolume, as compared to NSGA-II. This difference is visible for small n k (+4% for n k = 2) and is especially prominent for large n k (+60% for n k = 25). For n k between 13 https://deap.readthedocs.io/en/master/ 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8  5 and 7, PO-prob results in lower values of hypervolume than NSGA-II. However, the relative decrease in thes cases does not exceed -1.63%. Also, within this range, PO-count performs slightly better than other algorithms. These results demonstrate that the proposed approach improves the performance of genetic algorithms, especially in the case of many-objective optimization.

Finally, we demonstrate a successful application of the developed theory. We show that sorting by k-Pareto optimality can drastically improve the performance of many-objective genetic optimization algorithms. In our experiments, the proposed solution based on the probability measure allows increasing the value of hypervolume by up to 60% for 25 objectives.

In this section, we further analyze the behavior of both the state-of-the-art and the proposed algorithms with respect to other metrics. In particular, we study the fraction of solutions dominated by the solution of alternative algorithms and analyze the time complexity of the sorting procedure.\nWe calculate the percentage of dominated solutions as follows. For a given pair of algorithms algorithm1 and algorithm2, we calculate how many solutions of algorithm2 (dominated algorithm) are dominated by solutions of algorithm1 (dominating algorithm). After that, we average the obtained results among all dominating algorithms to get an average fraction of dominated solutions, denoted by \u03b8. Naturally, lower values of \u03b8 indicate better performance. We present the corresponding results in Fig. 14. We notice the following tendencies. NSGA-II and PO-count behave very similarly. For n k = 2, the value of \u03b8 for these algorithms is around 20%. After that, it starts increasing and reaches its peak of approximately 45% for n k = 7. Finally, it gradually decreases to 24% for n k = 25. NSGA-III starts at a similar level and reaches its peak of approximately 30% for n k = 5. After that, it decreases below 10% for n k = 7 and stays relatively close to 0 for the larger numbers of knapsacks. These results demonstrate the superiority of NSGA-III over NSGA-II in the case of many-objective optimization. PO-prob starts at around 16%. However, for n k = 4 the value of \u03b8 it already almost 0 and does not go up for larger numbers of knapsacks. This shows that the solutions produced by this algorithm are rarely dominated. Thereby, PO-prob is an effective approach for many-objective optimization problems. In Fig. 15, we demonstrate the dependence of sorting time on the population size for values of pop size ranging from 50 to 500. The reported values are the averages over 100 independent executions of one iteration of the corresponding genetic algorithm. From the figure, we can see that PO-prob requires much less time than all other algorithm. The results for NSGA-II and PO-count tend to be very close, as in other experiments. This observation also has theoretical explanation. Indeed, choosing the next generation for NSGA-II and NSGA-III has time complexity of O(N 2 M ) and max{O(N 2 M ), O(N 2 log M -2 N )} respectively where M stands for number of objectives and N is the population size, see [Deb et al., 2002,Deb andJain, 2013]. At the same time, sorting in PO-prob comes down to independent sorting procedures with respect to every objective. The time complexity of this procedure is O(N M log(N )). These results are in line with the theoretical analysis presented in Section 5.1 and prove the computational efficiency of the approximate ranking calculation procedure used in PO-prob.\nThe maximum choice theorem (Theorem 1) has an intuitive interpretation in the context of genetic algorithms. Assume that the selection step is required to pick a selection of a given maximum size for breeding offspring, and both parents are chosen independently and at random form this selection. Then selections obtained via k-Pareto optimality-based sorting yield most offspring with parents offering choice.

Moreover, diversity only depends on the copula which encodes the dependency structure between X 1 and X 2 , see Section 4.2.2 and Appendix B.3. Therefore, a value of div(\u2126) close to zero indicates X 1 and X 2 are strongly correlated via an increasing function. It leads to the idea that Kendall's \u03c4 rank correlation coefficient [Kendall, 1948] and diversity are strongly related concepts.\nLet us consider a sample of n points X = {(x i1 , x i2 ) i\u2208{1,2,...,n} }. Duplicates almost never occur and the order in which points are drawn has no importance. Therefore, X should be treated like a set. We consider the counting measure # and the relation R define on X.

As duplicates are discarded and the pairs are not ordered, n 0 = n(n -1)/2.\nFrom the above remarks, we have cho # = 2# dis +n and # con +# dis = n 0 . Combining these equalities, we obtain the following relation\n\u03c4 = n 2 + n -2 cho # n 2 -n .\nDividing the numerator and the denominator by n 2 and then neglecting 1 n , we obtains that approximately\n\u03c4 \u2248 1 -2 div # .\nThis result means that the theory developed in this paper can be used for constructing non-parametric statistical tests generalizing Kendall's \u03c4 rank correlation coefficient and can be used for testing partial correlation. Below, we illustrate this property by building an indicator for distinguishing between wealthy and non-wealthy states.\nA group of states might be considered wealthy if the following two conditions hold.\n1. In the group there is no positive correlation between per capita income and the indicator representing education and health.\n2. If a state belongs to a group of wealthy states, then all states having higher per capita income and better value of education and health indicator, must also belong to that group. Now, we define the set of all wealthy states as the largest group of states that are wealthy. If Kendall's \u03c4 is used to compute correlation, and correlation is considered to be positive if div # < 1 2 , then the elements of the above set can be easily identified. Indeed, Corollary 1 says that the set of wealthy states must be a set of at-least k-Pareto optimal states for the relation higher income and better education and health indicator. For the year 2015foot_9 , we took Gross National Income (GNI) per capita at purchasing power parity (PPP) as the income indicator, and the square root of the education and life expectancy as the education and health indicatorfoot_10 .

There are many possible fuzzy relaxations and the problem is to find one that is suitable for a given application. The k-Pareto optimality is one of such fuzzy extensions of the query. It is 0 if all criteria are satisfied, and higher values of k-Pareto optimality indicate worse results. The maximum choice theorem applies here, and the user is offered the maximum choice. This is of particular interest for exploratory queries, such as job search, especially, if there are no items in the database that satisfy all the criteria. Direct brute-force search for selections offering maximum choice is unfeasible as there are too many selections to consider.\nMoreover, in the above formalism, one can treat classical optimization objectives in the same way. Maximizing an attribute x can be represented by the relation xRy iff x \u2265 y, and the minimization can be represented by the relation \u2264. In the above framework, negation can be represented via the relation R -1 defined by xR -1 y iff yRx.", "publication_ref": [], "figure_ref": [], "table_ref": []}, {"heading": "C.6 Scheduling Algorithms", "text": "In the case of scheduling algorithms, xRy can be given the meaning 'x depends on y'. Then, selections represent sets of tasks that remain to be processed. Having a large choice means having much freedom to parallelize tasks or having flexibility in case the rescheduling is required.", "publication_ref": [], "figure_ref": [], "table_ref": []}, {"heading": "Supplementary Materials A Further Examples for Simple Relations and Measures", "text": "In the first two supplementary examples, we consider a situation typical in economics or multi-objective optimization. Later, we show how the proposed concepts apply to arbitrary transitive relations.", "publication_ref": [], "figure_ref": [], "table_ref": []}, {"heading": "A.1 Continuous Measures", "text": "Let us again consider R as defined in Section 2.3. The relation R models preference for small values of x 1 and x 2 . However, instead of assuming X to be a finite subset of R 2 , we now study the unit square [0, 1] \u00d7 [0, 1] with three continuous measures: the Lebesgue area measure dx 1 dx 2 , as well as 2x 2 dx 1 dx 2 and 4x 1 x 2 dx 1 dx 2 . In each case, the total measure of the unit square equals to one. The Lebesgue area measure represents elements with two uniformly distributed characteristics x 1 and x 2 ; 2x 2 dx 1 dx 2 represents rarefaction of items having small values of x 2 , whereas 4x 1 x 2 dx 1 dx 2 represents rarefaction of items having small values of both x 1 and x 2 .\nFor each of the cases defined above, in Fig. 8a we show the set of at least k-Pareto optimal elements of measure 0.1, which corresponds to selecting the 10 best percent. All three sets demonstrate the qualitative behaviours expected from sets delimited by indifference curves when the corresponding rarefaction occurs. Indeed, the curve corresponding to the uniform distribution and the Lebesgue area measure dx 1 dx 2 is symmetric. Also, in this case, po(x 1 , x 1 ) = x 1 x 2 , and the sets of at least k-Pareto optimal elements are the sets situated below arcs of hyperbola defined by the equation x 1 x 2 = k, see Sections 4.2 and 4.2.1 for more details. Applying rarefaction with respect to x 2 prioritises smaller values of this characteristic. This is represented by shifting upwards the right part of the hyperbola arc, see the curve for 2x 2 dx 1 dx 2 . Indeed, in this case, the small values of x 2 are observed less often. This results in selecting additional elements with large values of x 1 but relatively small values of x 2 to compensate for this rarefaction. Finally, rarefaction with respect to both x 1 and x 2 results in the fact that the small values of both characteristics are observed less often. Thus, elements with larger values of x 1 and x 2 should be selected to generate a selection of the required measure. It results in the shift of the hyperbola upwards following the direction of the main diagonal, see the curve for 4x 1 x 2 dx 1 dx 2 .
