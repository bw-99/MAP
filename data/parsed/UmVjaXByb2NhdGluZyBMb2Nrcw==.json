  "Abstract": "We present Reciprocating Locks , a novel mutual exclusion locking algorithm, targeting cache-coherent shared memory (CC), that enjoys a number of desirable properties. The doorway arrival phase and the Release operation both run in constant-time. Waiting threads use local spinning and only a single waiting element is required per thread, regardless of the number of locks a thread might hold at a given time. While our lock does not provide strict FIFO admission, it bounds bypass and has strong anti-starvation properties. The lock is compact, space efficient, and has been intentionally designed to be readily usable in real-world general purpose computing environments such as pthreads, or C++. Weshowthe lock exhibits high throughput under contention and low latency in the uncontended case. Under sustained contention, Reciprocating Locks generate less coherence traffic than MCS and CLH. The performance of Reciprocating Locks is competitive with and often better than the best state-of-the-art scalable queue-based spin locks.

  "1 Introduction": "Locks often have a crucial impact on the performance of parallel software, hence they remain the focus of intensive research with a steady stream of algorithms proposed over the last several decades. Reciprocating Locks was motivated by the desire for a lock algorithm that scales well under contention, but also avoids the various entanglements of 'queue node' lifecycle concerns that manifest under current state-of-the-art locks such as CLH[16, 42] and MCS[46]. Such concerns can make those locks a challenge to integrate into real-world software. We also wanted constant-time arrival and release paths, but were willing to forego strict FIFO admission order. Finally, we were motivated to design an architecturally informed lock that works well with recent developments in modern NUMA cache-coherent communication fabrics. Common lock algorithms include Ticket Locks, MCS and CLH. Ticket Locks [31, 45, 50] are simple and compact, requiring just two words for each lock instance and no perthread data. They perform well in the absence of contention, alex.kogan@oracle.com Oracle Labs USA exhibiting low latency because of short code paths. Under contention, however, performance suffers [22] because all threads contending for a given lock will busy-wait on a central location, increasing coherence costs. For contended operation, so-called queue based locks, such as CLH[16, 42] and MCS[46] provide relief via local spinning [28]. For both CLH and MCS, arriving threads enqueue an element (sometimes called a 'node') onto the tail of a queue and then busy-wait on a flag in either their own element (MCS) or the predecessor's element (CLH). Critically, at most one thread busy-waits on a given location at any one time, increasing the rate at which ownership can be transferred from thread to thread relative to techniques that use global spinning, such as Ticket Locks.",
  "2 The Reciprocating Lock Algorithm": "Briefly, under contention, Reciprocating Locks 1 partitions the set of waiting threads into two disjoints lists, which we call the arrival and entry segments. Threads arriving to acquire the lock will push (prepend) themselves onto a stack, using an atomic exchange operation, forming the arrival segment . When the owner releases the lock, it first tries to pass ownership to any threads found in the entry segment . Otherwise, if the entry segment is found empty, the thread then uses an atomic exchange to detach the entire current arrival segment (setting it empty), which then becomes the next entry segment, and then passes ownership to the first element of the entry segment 2 . In Reciprocating Locks, a lock instance consists of an arrival word. We deem the lock held if the arrival word is non-zero. Specifically, a value of 0 ( nullptr ) encodes the unlocked state, 1 ( LOCKEDEMPTY ) encodes the state of simple locked - locked with an empty arrival segment - and other values encode being locked, where the remainder of the arrival word points to a stack of threads that have recently arrived at the lock and are waiting for admission, forming the arrival segment. Threads arriving to acquire the lock use an atomic swap (exchange) operator to install the address of a thread-private waiting element into the arrival word. If the return value from the atomic exchange was nullptr then the arriving thread managed to acquire the lock without contention and can immediately enter the critical section. Otherwise, our thread has encountered contention and must wait.

The nonnullptr value returned from the atomic exchange identifies the next thread in the stack. Similar to the HemLock[26] and CLH[16, 42] lock algorithms, a thread knows only the identity of its immediate neighbor in the arrival segment, and unlike MCS, no explicit linked list of waiting threads is formed or required 3 . That is, the arrival stack is implicit with no next pointer fields in the waiting elements. Our thread then proceeds to local spinning on a flag field within its waiting element. This flag will eventually be set during normal ownership succession by some thread running in the Release operation, passing ownership to our waiting thread. Our thread, still executing in Acquire and now the owner, arranges to convey the address of the next thread in the entry segment, which was obtained from the atomic exchange, to the subsequent corresponding Release operation. The thread identified by that address will subsequently serve as the successor to our current thread. Our thread finally enters the critical section. In the corresponding Release operator, if a successor was passed from the corresponding Acquire operator, we simply enable that thread to enter the critical section by setting the flag in its waiting element. Otherwise, we attempt to use an atomic compare_and_exchange (CAS) operation to swing the arrival word from simple locked state back to unlocked . If the CAS was successful then no waiting threads exist and the lock reverts to unlocked state. If the CAS failed, however, additional newly arrived threads must be present on the arrival segment. In that case we employ an atomic exchange to detach the entire arrival segment, leaving the arrival word in simple locked state, encoded as 1. We then pass lock ownership to the first thread in the detached segment by setting the flag in its waiting element. Crucially, under contention, threads arrive and join the arrival segment. While the entry segment remains populated, ownership is passed through the entry segment elements in turn. When the current entry segment becomes empty, the Release operator detaches the arrival segment, (via an atomic exchange) which then becomes the next entry segment. Threads migrate, in groups, from the arrival segment to the entry segment. The arrival segment consists of those newly arrived threads currently pushed onto the stack anchored at the arrival word while entry segment reflects a set of threads that have already been detached from the arrival stack. The Release operator consults the entry segment first via the successor reference passed from Acquire to Release - and passes ownership to the successor if possible. The sequence of successor references passed from Acquire to 3 Regarding terminology, say thread 𝐴 arrives and pushes itself onto the stack and then 𝐵 follows. In terms of arrival, 𝐴 is 𝐵 's predecessor . But in terms of subsequent admission order, in Reciprocating Locks, 𝐴 is 𝐵 's successor . There is no such situational distinction between arrival and admission for FIFO Release constitutes the entry segment. But if the entry segment is empty - the passed successor argument is nullptr -Release then attempts to replenish the entry segment by detaching the arrival segment, and transferring ownership to the first element. In the event the arrival segment is found empty, the lock reverts to unlocked state. The arrival segment is implemented by means of a concurrent pop-stack [9], where the key primitives are push and detach-all , which makes our technique immune to the A-B-A pathology [54]. By convention, in Reciprocating Locks, only the current lock holder detaches the arrival segment. The waiting element is similar to the CLH or MCS 'queue node'. In our implementation, we opt to place a thread's wait element in thread-local storage (TLS). As a thread can wait on at most one lock at any given time, such a singleton suffices, and tightly bounds memory usage. Given that we form a stack for arriving threads, admission order is LIFO within a segment, but remains FIFO between segments. As such, if thread 𝑇 1 pushes itself onto the arrival segment in Acquire , and then waits, and 𝑇 2 arrives and pushes itself after 𝑇 1, then a given thread 𝑇 2 can bypass or overtake 𝑇 1 at most once before 𝑇 1 is next granted ownership, providing thread-specific bounded bypass and thus avoiding indefinite starvation. Alternatively, we could say Reciprocating Locks provides classic 𝐾 -bounded bypass (worst case) where 𝐾 reflects the cardinality of the population of threads that might compete for the lock, yielding population bounded bypass .",
  "3 Implementation Details": "In Listing-1 we show an implementation of Reciprocating Locks in modern C++. For brevity, this version expresses the critical section as a C++ lambda expression and passes the variables succ and eos from the acquire phase to the corresponding release phase. If desired, it is possible to collapse those into just one variable by a change in encoding. Under a legacy locking interface, with distinct lock() and unlock() operators, context may be passed via extra fields in the lock body or conveyed via thread-local storage. Nonescaping lambdas are efficient and add no particular runtime overhead 4 . The assert statements in the listing express invariants and do not constitute checks against errant usage of the lock. We also assume the existence of a 'polite' Pause() operator for busy-waiting. For encoding the arrival word, we assume that low-order bit of wait element addresses are 0. We further assume the existence of a wait-free atomic exchange operator. To maintain progress properties, the implementation thereof should not be via loops that employ optimistic compare-and-swap or load-locked and store-conditional primitives. In particular we assume that C++ std::atomic 4 Example usage : ReciprocatingLock L {}; int v = 5; L + [&]{ v += 2;} ; Some Confusion and variations for definit on of 'bounde bypas '. * Wik pedia : Bounde means that he number of times a proces wait ng, or bounde bypas , is bypas ed by another proces after it has indicated its desire to enter the crit cal section is bounde by a function of the number of proces es in the sy tem. * Variations @ bypas - by proces es number of incidences of overtaking any any proces by any proces @bypas by any one specific - by a proces of incidences of overtaking by one proces * terminol gy : bounde fre dom * Keywords : bypas ; overtake; starvation; bounde finite wait ng; number bypas vs bounde wait ng * Raynal : starvation bypas ; livenes ; progres ; overtaking lockout-fre dom; 2025-06-12 · Copyright Oracle and or its affiliates Reciprocating Locks Listing 1.

  "4 Execution Scenarios": "To further explain the operation of Reciprocating Locks we next annotate key scenarios, showing Reciprocating Locks in action. ▶ Simple uncontended Acquire and Release : 1 Thread 𝑇 1 arrives at Line-14 to acquire lock 𝐿 . 𝐿 's arrival word is currently nullptr , indicating that 𝐿 is in unlocked state. 2 At Line-17, 𝑇 1 initializes its thread-specific waiting element, 𝐸 , in anticipation of potential contention. 3 𝑇 1 then swaps the address of 𝐸 into 𝐿 1's arrival word in Line-20. The atomic exchange returns nullptr , indicating uncontended acquisition, so control passes into the critical section at Line-47. When the critical section completes execution, control enters the release phase at Line-50. 4 As there are no successors, execution reaches the CAS operation at Line-66. As no additional threads have arrived, the CAS is successful and control returns from Line-66, completing the operation. The CAS reverts the arrival to unlocked state. ▶ Onset of contention In this scenario we show how to recover from a race in Acquire where a thread pushes its wait element onto the stack but, because of other arriving threads, is not able, in the Release operation, to CAS the arrival word back to 1, and its element becomes 'submerged' on the arrival stack. We tolerate this situation by conveying the address of that submerged element through the segment, during succession, allowing us to treat the buried element as the effective end-of-segment (equivalent to nullptr ) and otherwise ignore it. We convey that address through the wait element Gate field, when passing ownership. In this case we say we have a zombie terminal element. During succession a thread checks the address of its successor to determine if matches the submerged terminal element. 1 Lock 𝐿 is in unlocked state and thread 𝑇 1 arrives and acquires the lock. 𝑇 1 executes the atomic exchange at Line-20 to install the address of its wait element 𝐸 , which we will designate 𝐸 1, into 𝐿 's arrival word, the exchange returns 0 ( nullptr ), so 𝑇 1 now holds the lock. 𝑇 1 enters the critical section. 2 Thread 𝑇 2 now arrives to acquire 𝐿 and exchanges the address of its wait element, 𝐸 2 into the lock's arrival word. 𝑇 2's successor is 𝑇 1 and 𝑇 2 enters the waiting loop at Line-30. 3 Thread 𝑇 3 also arrives and pushes the address of its wait element, 𝐸 3, onto the arrival stack. 𝑇 3, whose successor is 𝑇 2, enters the waiting loop at Line-30. 4 𝑇 1 finishes execution of the critical section and then starts the Release operation. At Line-66, 𝑇 1 attempts uses a CAS to try to release 𝐿 replacing the address of its 𝐸 1 with nullptr encoding. The CAS fails, however, as other threads have Explicate, xplain, expound, il ustrate, demonstrate, show, il uminate Nar ative, an ota ed scenario, flow, example, depict Reciprocating Locks in action remedy, mit gate, recover, tolerate, logical, effective, tantamount 2025-06-12 · Copyright Oracle and or its affiliates Dice and Kogan arrived, and the arrival word now points to 𝐸 3 instead of 𝐸 1. At this point, 𝑇 1's wait element 𝐸 1 is 'buried' or 'submerged' in the arrival stack, residing at the distal end. 5 As the CAS failed, control reaches Line-73 where 𝑇 1 detaches the new arrivals. The atomic exchange replaces 𝐸 3 with a special LOCKEDEMPTY distinguished value, which indicates the lock is held but that the arrival list is empty and has been previously detached. 6 At Line-76, 𝑇 1 stores its eos (end-of-segment) address, which refers to 𝐸 1, into 𝐸 3's Gate field. This both enables 𝑇 3 and conveys the address of 𝐸 1 to 𝑇 3. 𝑇 1 has completed is locking episode. 7 𝑇 3, at Line-30, observes that its Gate field is now 𝐸 1. Its local eos variable now refers to 𝐸 1. 𝑇 3 now has ownership. The comparison at Line-37 does not match, so 𝑇 3 enters the critical section. 8 𝑇 3 executes the critcal section. Upon return from the critical section, 𝑇 3 at Line-53, recognizes that it has a successor, 𝑇 2 ( 𝐸 2), on the detached entry segment. At Line-58, 𝑇 3 stores its eos value, 𝐸 1, into 𝐸 2's Gate field. The store conveys both the identity of the end-of-segment and ownership. 𝑇 3 has finished its locking episode and returns at line-59. 9 𝑇 2 observes at Line-30 that is has received ownership, and its eos value is now 𝐸 1. 𝑇 2's indicated successor is 𝑇 1 ( 𝐸 1) and the comparsion at Line-37 matches, so we have reached the end of the detached entry segment. 𝑇 2 then clears its local succ successor pointer and sets its local eos value to LOCKEDEMPTY . 10 𝑇 2 enters and executes the critical section. 11 Control in 𝑇 2 reaches line-66, where the CAS succeeds and swings the arrival word from LOCKEDEMPTY to unlocked . We note that a contended Release operation might need to execute two atomic operations, the CAS at Line-66 and the exchange at Line-76, potentially increasing RMR complexity [4, 7]. In practice, given the narrow window, the underlying cache line tends remain to local modified state. If desired, to mitigate this concern, we could condition the CAS on an immediate prior load, reducing the number of futile CAS operations. We found this optimization provided no observable benefit, and did not use it. In the case where 𝐸 is submerged, we use 𝐸 's address for addressed-based comparisons (Line-37) as a distinguished marker or sentinel to indicate the logical end-of-segment. 𝐸 itself, however, will not be subsequently accessed by succession within the segment. Elements associated with a given thread can appear on at most one segment at any time, but, when an address is used as an end-of-segment marker, it is possible that it appears on both the arrival segment and entry segment. We observe that the eos value could also reside in a field the lock body, potentially sequestered and isolated on a dedicated cache line, instead of in the waiting elements. While viable, that approach increases the size of the lock body, and increases induced coherence traffic. Instead, we borrow a technique from Compact NUMA-Aware Locks (CNA) [21] and avoid such shared central fields by propagating information - in this case the address of the terminal element of the segment - through the chain of waiting elements. ▶ Sustained contention 1 Lock 𝐿 is initially in unlocked state. Thread 𝑇 1 arrives to acquire 𝐿 . 𝑇 1's exchange operation at Line-20 installs the address of 𝑇 1's wait element, 𝐸 1, into 𝐿 's arrival word. As the exchange returned nullptr , 𝑇 1 has acquired the lock. 2 𝑇 1 enters and executes the critical section. 3 While 𝑇 1 holds 𝐿 , thread 𝑇 2 arrives and 𝐸 2 pushes onto the arrival stack. The exchange operation at Line-20 returns 𝐸 1 into 𝑇 2's local tail variable. As tail is non-0, 𝑇 2 must wait at Line-29. 𝑇 2 local succ variable refers to 𝐸 1. 4 With 𝑇 1 still holding 𝐿 , 𝑇 3 also arrives and uses the atomic exchange to push its element 𝐸 3 onto the arrival stack. The exchange returns 𝐸 2 and 𝑇 3's succ variable points to 𝐸 2. The arrival stack consists of 𝐸 3 followed by 𝐸 2 followed by 𝐸 1, although 𝐸 1 is 'buried' and will be excised during subsequent succession. The entry segment is empty. 𝑇 3 waits on 𝐸 3 at Line-30 5 Similarly, 𝑇 4 arrives and pushes 𝐸 4 onto the arrival stack and then waits. 𝑇 4's successor variable points to 𝐸 3. 6 𝑇 1 eventually completes the critical section and then executes the Release phase at Line-50. As 𝑇 1's succ variable is nullptr , indicating an empty entry segment, 𝑇 1 then attempts the CAS, at Line-66 which fails. 𝑇 1 then executes exchange( LOCKEDEMPTY ) to detach the arrival segment at Line-73. The exchange operator returns 𝐸 4. The arrival segment is now empty and the entry segment consists of 𝐸 4 then 𝐸 3 then 𝐸 2 then 𝐸 1. 𝑇 1 passes ownership to 𝑇 4 at Line-76, passing the address of 𝐸 1 as the end-of-segment marker. 7 𝑇 4 is now the owner and departs its waiting phase at Line-31, having received 𝐸 1 as the end-of-segment address. The end-of-segment address check at Line-37 does not match, so 𝑇 4 enters the critical section. 8 while 𝑇 4 holds 𝐿 , 𝑇 5 and then 𝑇 6 arrive to acquire 𝐿 , pushing 𝐸 5 and then 𝐸 6, respectively, onto the arrival stack. The arrival segment consists of 𝐸 6 then 𝐸 5 and the detached entry segment is just 𝐸 3 and 𝐸 2 and 𝐸 1. When 𝑇 5 arrived, its exchange replaced LOCKEDEMPTY with 𝐸 5. Crucially, Line-25 converted LOCKEDEMPTY , which is encoded as 1, to a effective successor value of nullptr . 9 𝑇 4 releases the lock. As 𝐸 3 is 𝑇 4's the successor, we grant ownership to 𝑇 3 at Line-58, again passing 𝐸 1 as the end-of-segment address. 10 𝑇 3 departs its wait phase at Line-31 and enters and executes the critical section. 11 𝑇 3 releases the lock, observing 𝐸 2 as its successor and grants ownership to 𝑇 2 at Line-58, again, passing 𝐸 1 as the end-of-segment, 12 𝑇 2 departs its wait phase at line-31. In this particular step, the address check at Line-37 matches, and 𝑇 2 annuls its succ variable and sets its eos to LOCKEMPTY . We have reached the end of the entry segment, which is now exhausted. 𝑇 2 enters and executes the critical section. 13 𝑇 2 executes the release phase, and since succ is nullptr at Line-53, the current entry segment is empty. 𝑇 2 then attempts the CAS at line 66, Terminus, end-of-segment, eos, marker, sentinel, ghost, zombie, alternative end mark, tombstone, section mark; pilcrow, fleuron, hed ra, dinkus, -30- Eos; end-of-segment; erminus; Vesper; Astraeus; fini; Boustrophedonic UB; Nas l Demons; halt-and-catch-fire locks diverge from ac demic locks nd, Vesper, punctuation, virtual, phantom 2025-06-12 · Copyright Oracle and or its affiliates Reciprocating Locks practical; pragmatic; de facto; QoI = quality of implementa ion, desiderat multi udes; plural ocking which tries to replace LOCKEDEMPTY with unlocked .

𝑇 6's successor is 𝑇 5. 𝑇 6 enters the critical section. 15 𝑇 6 completes the critical section and executes the release phase.

  "5 Additional Requirements": "We target lock algorithms that are suitable for environments such as the Linux kernel, as a replacement for the user-level pthreads_mutex primitive, or for use in runtime environments such as the HotSpot Java Virtual Machine (JVM), which is written in C++. As such, we identify additional de-facto requirements for general purpose lock algorithms. Safe Against Prompt Lock Destruction Various lock algorithms perform stores in the Release operation that potentially release ownership, but then perform additional accesses to fields in the lock body to ensure succession and progress. This can result in a class of unsafe use-after-free memory reference errors [13, 47] if a lock is used to protect its own existence. A detailed description of such an error can be found in [26]. All algorithms for use in the linux kernel or in the pthreads environment are expected to be prompt lock destruction safe, constituting a de facto requirement. Support for Large Numbers of Extant Threads The algorithms must support the simultaneous participation of an arbitrary number of threads, where threads are created and destroyed dynamically, and the peak number of extant threads is not known in advance. Support for Large Numbers of Extant Locks Similarly, the algorithm needs to support large numbers of lock instances, which can be created and destroyed dynamically. Recent work [40] shows the Linux kernel has more than 6000 statically initialized lock instances. Again, the number of locks is not know in advance, as drivers load, and unload, for instance, or as data structures containing locks dynamically resize. Plural Locking A given thread is expected to be able to lock and hold a large number of locks simultaneously. In the Linux kernel, for instance, situations arise when 40 or more distinct locks are held by a single thread at a given time, as evidenced by the MAX_LOCK_DEPTH tunable, which is used by the kernel's 'lockdep' facility to track the set of locks held in an explicit per-thread list for the purposes of detecting potential deadlock. Furthermore, locks must be able to be released in non-LIFO imbalanced order as it is fairly common to acquire a lock in one routine, return, and then release the lock in the caller. Space Efficient We expect the lock algorithm to be frugal and parsimonious with regard to space usage. Critically, any algorithms that require per-lock and per-thread storage - with 𝑇ℎ𝑟𝑒𝑎𝑑𝑠 ∗ 𝐿𝑜𝑐𝑘𝑠 space consumption - such as Anderson's Array-Based Queue Lock [6], are not suitable. FIFO as a non-goal We also note that many real-world lock implementations, such as the current implementation of Java's 'synchronized' in the HotSpot Java Virtual Machine, the java.util.Concurrent.ReentrantLock , and the default pthread_mutex on Linux, are non-FIFO, and in fact permit unbounded bypass and indefinite starvation. Relatedly, Compact NUMA-Aware Locks (CNA) [21] intentionally imposes non-FIFO admission order to improve throughput on NUMA platforms, trading aggregate throughput against strict FIFO ordering. 5 . In fact, strict FIFO locking is an antipattern for common practical lock designs, as it suffers from reduced throughput compared to more relaxed admission schedules, and has shortcomings when used with waiting techniques that deschedule threads, or when involuntary preemption is in play [18, 20, 23, 24]. Forgoing strict FIFO admission schedules allows more opportunism that in some circumstances may translate into improved throughput. Work Conserving We desire that the lock is work conserving and avoids the use of backoff delays, which can otherwise constitute 'dead time'. Given these particular constraints, we exclude a number of algorithms from consideration. Dvir's algorithms [29], Rhee's algorithm [51], Lee's HL1 and HL2 [38, 39], and Jayanati's 'Ideal Queued Spinlock' [36] [37] algorithms, when simplified for use in cache-coherent (CC) environments, all have extremely simple and elegant paths and low RMR complexity, suggesting they would be competitive and good candidates, but they do not readily tolerate multiple locks being held simultaneously. The above tend to use so-called 'nodetoggling' and 'node-switching' techniques - also called 'two-face' by Lee - that, while they work well when a thread holds at most one lock, are awkward for general purpose use. Our specific concerns are space blow-up due to the need to maintain toggle element pairs and a 'face' index for pairs of locks and threads, in addition to the requirement that we re-associate that metadata with the lock instance at releasetime. Some of Dvir and Lee's algorithms are also not safe against prompt lock destruction. 5 Even if a lock has strict FIFO admission order, otherwise identical threads can still suffer from persistent long-term unfairness related to shared cache residency imbalance, reflecting the 'Matthew Effect'[25]. 2025-06-12 · Copyright Oracle and or its affiliates Dice and Kogan",

Simple test-and-set or polite test-and-test-and-set [52] locks are compact and exhibit excellent latency for uncontended operations, but fail to scale and may allow unfairness and even indefinite starvation. Ticket Locks are compact and FIFO, and also have excellent latency for uncontended operations, but they also fail to scale because of global spinning, although some variations attempt to overcome this obstacle, at the cost of increased space [22, 48]. For instance, Anderson's array-based queueing lock [5, 6] is based on Ticket Locks but provides local spinning. It employs a waiting array for each lock instance, sized to ensure there is at least one array element for each potentially waiting thread, yielding a potentially large footprint. The maximum number of participating threads must be known in advance when initializing the lock. TWA[22] is a variation on ticket locks that reduces the incidence of global spinning. Queue-based locks such as MCS or CLH are FIFO and provide local spinning and are thus more scalable. MCS is used in the linux kernel for the low-level 'qspinlock' construct [14, 15, 41]. Modern extensions of MCS edit the queue order to make the lock NUMA-Aware [21]. MCS readily allows editing and re-ordering of the queue of waiting threads, [19, 21, 43] whereas editing the chain is more difficult under CLH, HemLock and Reciprocating Locks, where there are no explicit linked lists. CLH is extremely simple, has excellent RMR complexity, and requires just an single atomic exchange operation in the Acquire operation and no atomic read-modify-write instructions in Release . Unfortunately the waiting elements migrate between threads, which may be inimical to performance in NUMA environments. CLH locks also require explicit constructors and destructors, which may be inconvenient 6 . Our specific implementation uses a variation on Scott's [52] Figure 4.14, which converts the CLH lock to be context-free [56], adhering to a simple programming interface that passes just the address of the lock, albeit at the cost of adding an extra field to the lock body to convey the address of the head waiting element to Release . The K42 [8, 52] variation of MCS can recover the queue element before returning from Acquire whereas classic MCS 6 Many lock implementations require just trivial constructors to set the lock fields to 0 or some constant, and trivial destructors, which do nothing. The Linux kernel spinlock_t / qspinlock_t interface provides a constructor, but does not even expose a destructor. Similarly, C++ std::mutex is allowed to be trivially destructible , meaning storage occupied by trivially destructible objects may be reused without calling the destructor. Under both GCC g++ version 13 and Clang++ Version 18, is_trivially_destructible reports True for std::mutex , and as such, destructors do not run. This situation could be rectified by recompiling, but we would also need to recompile all libraries transitively depended on by the application, including those deployed in shared libraries in binary-only form on the system. recovers the queue element in Release . That is, under K42, a queue element is needed only while waiting but not while the lock is held, and as such, queue elements can always be allocated on stack, if desired. While appealing, the paths are much more complex and touch more cache lines than the classic version, impacting performance. In addition, neither the doorway nor the Release path operate in constant time. HemLock combines aspects of both CLH and MCS to form a lock that has very simple waiting node lifecycle constraints, is context-free but still scales well in common usage scenarios. HemLock does not provide constant remote memory reference (RMR) complexity [29] in scenarios where a thread holds multiple contended locks. In this situation the single node suffers from multi-waiting [26]. Similar to MCS, HemLock lacks a constant-time unlock operation, whereas the unlock operator for CLH and Tickets is constant-time. Unlike MCS, HemLock requires active synchronous back-and-forth communication in the unlock path between the outgoing thread and its successor to protect the lifecycle of the waiting element. We note, however, that HemLock remains constanttime in the Release operator to the point where ownership is conveyed to the successor. HemLock uses address-based transfer of ownership, writing the address of the lock instead of a boolean, differentiating it from MCS and CLH. Reciprocating Locks, like HemLock, requires just a singleton per-thread waiting element allocated in thread-local storage. The closest related work to Reciprocating Locks that we know of is Chen's mutual exclusion algorithm[11, 12], where arriving threads use an atomic exchange on arrival to either acquire the lock or join a LIFO stack of recently arrived waiting threads. A new stack is detached (or closed in their terminology) when the current stack is exhausted. Their progress and bounded bypass properties are the same as found in Reciprocating Locks. Their approach uses global spinning, however, and requires at least 2 shared global variables - above and beyond context passed from Acquire to Release in the form of the immediate successor. In addition, each Release mutates at least one global shared variable, increasing coherence traffic. We opted to exclude NUMA-aware locks such as Cohort Locks [27, 28] and Compact NUMA-Aware Locks (CNA) [21] from consideration. We excluded Fissile Locks and GCR[20] as they have lax time-based anti-starvation mechanism. Fissile, specifically, depends on the owner of the inner lock to make progress to monitor for starvation. We also excluded MCSH[35] which is a recent variation of MCS that uses on-stack allocation of queue nodes and hence supports a standard locking interface. Like MCS, the lock is not innately context-free, and additional information needs to be passed from Acquire to Release via extra fields in the lock body. In our experiments, the performance of MCSH is typically on par with MCS proper.

Comparison of lock algorithm properties to a specific successor and do not admit barging or pouncing where the lock is released even though waiting threads exist, which allow newly arriving threads to sieze the lock. In Table-1 we compare the attributes of various local algorithms. Red -colored cells indicate potential undesirable properties. Note that all the locks provide a constant-time doorway phase. In the following we explain the meaning of each property. Spinning : reflects whether the lock utilizes local , global or semi-local [26] spinning. Constant-time Unlock : indicates if the lock Release operation is bounded. As noted above, HemLock is constant-time up to the point where the lock is either released or transferred to a successor, but the Release operator, for reasons of memory safety, then waits for the successor to acknowledge transfer of ownership before the memory underlying the queue element can be potentially reused. Specifically, in HemLock an uncontended Release operation is constant-time and a contended Release is constant-time up to and including the point where ownership is conveyed to the successor. FIFO : indicates the lock provides strict FIFO admission. Context-free : indicates additional information does not need to be transferred from the lock operator to the corresponding Release operation. Path Complexity Acquire and Path Complexity Release : we measured the size of the Acquire and Release methods in units of platform independent LLVM intermediate representation (IR) instructions, as emitted by clang++-18 , which serves as a simple measure for path complexity. We note that much of the complexity found in TWA manifests through the use of the hash function which maps lock address and ticket value pairs to slots in the waiting array. On-Stack : indicates the queue elements, if any, may be allocated on-stack. This also implies the nodes do not migrate and have a tenure constrained to the duration of the locking episode. Nodes Circulate : queue elements migrate between threads. This often implies the need for an explicit queue element lifecycle management system and precludes convenient on-stack allocation of queue elements. Migration may also be unfriendly to performance in NUMA environments. Explicit CTOR/DTOR Required : indicates the lock requires nontrivial constructors or destructors. CLH, for instance, requires destructors to run to release the wait elements referenced in the lock, to avoid memory leaks. Maximum Remote Misses per episode : is the worst-case maximum number of misses to remote memory incurred, under simple sustained contention, by a matching Acquire -Release pair. Misses to remote memory - memory homed on a different NUMA node - may be more expensive than local misses on various platforms, such as modern Intel systems that use the UPI coherence fabric [17], where miss requests are first adjudicated by the home node of the cache line. Algorithms where nodes circulate appear more vulnerable to accumulating such remote misses. For HemLock , we assume simple contention with no multi-waiting . We derived the 'Maximum Remote Misses per episode' value via static inspection of the code, and determining which of the accesses that might cause coherence misses might also be to locations homed on remote nodes. Invalidations per episode : is the number of coherence misses, under sustained contention, experienced by an Acquire -Release episode in a given thread. We empirically approximate that number as follows. Using an ARMv8 system (described below), we modifed the MutexBench microbenchmark to have a degenerate critical section that advanced only a local random number generator and to pass any context from Acquire to Release via thread-local storage, in order to reduce mutation of shared memory.

As such, any misses are coherence misses. This technique yields a useful empirical metric on howmuchcoherence traffic various lock algorithms generate. Weused the ARM l2d_cache_inval hardware performance counter, which tallies L2 cache invalidation events, as simple proxy for coherence traffic - both latency and bandwith. We report the number of l2d_cache_inval events per episode. As can be seen, Reciprocating Locks is parsimonious and incurs just 4 invalidations per episode, while CLH requires 5 7 . Ticket locks require 𝑇 (10 in our example) invalidations per episode, where 𝑇 is the number of participating threads, given the global spinning. The number of misses incurred by CLH, MCS, HemLock and Reciprocating Locks is constant and not a function of the number of threads. These empirically-derived results align closely with a static analysis of the code and the expected number of coherence misses in the Acquire and Release paths. Space Complexity : reflects the space complexity of the lock algorithm where 𝑇 is the number of active threads, 𝐿 is the number of extant locks, 𝐴 is the number of locks currently held plus the number of threads currently waiting on locks, 𝐸 is the size of the waiting element. 𝑆 is the size of a lock instance. When a lock algorithm requires context to be passed from Acquire to the corresponding Release , we set 𝑆 to 2 to indicate that our implementation allocated an extra word in the lock body to pass such information. Implementations that require context can avoid that space requirement in the lock body if they opt to pass context information by other means, such as via thread-local storage, in which case 𝑆 would be 1. HemLock is context-free, so the per-lock space usage is just 1, while Ticket Locks and TWA require 2 words per lock. TWA requires an additional 4096 words for the global waiting table that is shared over all thread and lock instances. For MCS and CLH we assume that the implementation stores the head of the chain - reflecting the current owner - in an additional field in the lock body, and thus the lock consists of head and tail fields, requiring 2 words in total.",
  "7 Empirical Performance Results": "Unless otherwise noted, all data was collected on an Oracle X5-2 system system having 2 sockets, each populated with an Intel Xeon E5-2699 v3 CPU running at 2.30GHz. Each socket has 18 cores, and each core is 2-way hyperthreaded, yielding 7 We observed similar ratios with performance counters that reported the number of 'snoop' messages, and on Intel by counting OFFCORE requests. We also observed in passing, while examining data from hardware performance counters, that CLH and MCS suffered from more stalls (both event counts and duration) from misses than did Reciprocating locks. CLH in particular executes a dependent load in the critical path in the arrival doorway on the address returned from the atomic exchange . The address to be loaded from is not known until after the exchange returns, denying the processor the ability to speculate or execute out-of-order. 72 logical CPUs in total. The system was running Ubuntu 20.04 with a stock Linux version 5.4 kernel, and all software was compiled using the provided GCC version 9.3 toolchain at optimization level '-O3'. 64-bit C or C++ code was used for all experiments. Factory-provided system defaults were used in all cases, and Turbo mode [55] was left enabled. In all cases default free-range unbound threads were used, with no pinning of threads to processors. At above 18 ready threads, the kernel starts to place additional threads onto the second socket, and NUMA effects come into play. Weimplementedall user-mode locks within LD_PRELOAD interposition libraries that expose the standard POSIX pthread_ mutex_t programming interface using the framework from [28]. This allows us to change lock implementations by varying the LD_PRELOAD environment variable and without modifying the application code that uses locks. The C++ std::mutex construct is implemented directly via pthread_ mutex primitives, so interposition works for both C and C++ code. All lock busy-wait loops on Intel used the PAUSE instruction and YIELD on ARMv8. To reduce false sharing, all waiting elements were aligned and sequestered at 128-byte boundaries, and, for the 'MutexBench' benchmarks, below, the lock instances where similarly sequestered.

CLH presents something of a challenge when used under the pthread_mutex interface. First, pthreads allows the programmer to use trivial initializers - setting the mutex body to all 0 - and avoid calling pthread_mutex_init . To compensate, we modified pthread_mutex_lock to populate such an uninitialized lock with the CLH 'dummy node' lazily, ondemand, on the first lock operation. In pthread_mutex_destroy we free the node, if populated, but many applications also do not call pthread_mutex_destroy , which constitutes a memory leak. As such, to allow CLH to be included, we avoided applications that create and then abandon large numbers of locks in a dynamic fashion. Ticket is a classic Ticket Lock; HemLock is the HemLock algorithm, with the CTR (coherence traffic reduction) optimization. As we are implementing a general purpose pthreads locking interface, a thread can hold multiple locks at one time. Using MCS as an example, lets say thread 𝑇 1 currently holds locks 𝐿 1, 𝐿 2, 𝐿 3 and 𝐿 4. We'll assume no contention. 𝑇 1 will have deposited MCS queue nodes into each of those locks. MCS nodes can not be reclaimed until the corresponding unlock operation. Our implementation could malloc and free nodes as necessary - allocating in the lock operator and freeing in unlock - but to avoid malloc and its locks, we instead use a thread-local stack of free queue nodes. In the lock operator, we first try to allocate from that free list, and then fall back to malloc only as necessary. In unlock, we return nodes to that free list. This approach reduces malloc-free traffic and the incumbent scalability concerns. We currently don't bother to trim the thread-local stack of free elements. So, if thread 𝑇 1 currently holds no locks, the free stack will contain 𝑁 elements where 𝑁 is the maximum number of locks concurrently held by 𝑇 1. We reclaim the elements from the stack when 𝑇 1 exits. A stack is convenient for locality. In Figure-1a we make the following observations regarding operation at maximal contention with an empty critical section: · At 1 thread the benchmark measures the latency of uncontended Acquire and Release operations.

TWA is the clear leader in the 'middle' area of the graph, between 4 and 16 threads. · Broadly, at higher thread counts, HemLock performs slightly better than or the same as CLH or MCS, while Reciprocating Locks provides the best throughput. We note in passing that care must be taken when negative or retrograde scaling occurs and aggregate performance degrades as we increase threads. As a thought experiment, if a hypothetical lock implementation were to introduce additional synthetic delays outside the critical path, aggregate performance might increase as the delay throttles the arrival rate and concurrency over the contended lock [33]. As such, evaluating just the maximal contention case in isolation is insufficient. In Figure-1b we pass arguments to MutexBench that configure it to implement a delay in the non-critical section. Each thread has a private std::mt19937 pseudo-random number generator. The non-critical section generates, using the private PRNG, a uniform random number in the range [ 0 -250 ) and then advances its private PRNG that many steps. (We take care to make sure this operation can not be optimized away by consuming the PRNG value at the end of the thread's run). As above, the critical section advances the shared PRNG one step. As can be seen, we enjoy positive scalability up to about 5 threads. At higher thread counts, Reciprocating Locks manages to exhibit the least reduction in scalability. In Figure-1c and Figure-1d, we show the results of MutexBench on an ARMv8 (aarch64) system, showing that the relative performance of the various algorithms remains portable over disparate architectures.

  "7.2 std::atomic": "In Figure-2a, our C++ atomic exchange benchmark defines a simple structure type S that contains 5 32-bit integers. Each thread declares a local S instance, and we also declare a shared global std::atomic<S> A {} . The C++ compiler and runtime implement std::atomic for such objects by hashing the address of the instance into an array of mutexes, and acquiring those as needed to implement the desired atomic action. Each thread loops for 10 seconds, using std::atomic<S>::exchange to swap its local copy with the shared global, and we then report aggregate throughput rate, in terms of completed exchange operations, at the end of the measurement interval. The figure depicts the median score of 7 runs and the overall ranking of the locks is similar to that observed under MutexBench. Figure-2b is similar, but instead of std::atomic:exchange we use std::atomic:load to fetch the shared global, make a local copy, increment the 1st of the five constituent integer fields in that copy, and then call std::atomic:compare_ exchange_strong (CAS) in an inner loop to try replace the global copy with the updated local version. The load operator acquires and releases all necessary covering locks, as does the compare_exchange_strong operator. If the CAS fails, we update our fresh local copy (returned from CAS) and retry. At the end of the 10 second measurement interval we report total number of successful CAS operations. The graph reports the median score of 7 runs.

  "8 Discussion": "▶ Constant-time arrival doorway and Release paths, as a consequence of having desirable progress properties, may yield more predictable performance. Furthermore, such designs are more inherently amenable to 'polite' waiting, where a thread voluntarily deschedules itself and explicitly waits to be notified of transfer of ownership, by means of thread identity-based waiting primitives, such as park-unpark[18] or address-based waiting , such as the linux futex [32] primitive, which underlies the pthreads synchronization services. Use of such primitives allows the implementation to avoid toxic waiting policies, such as unbounded busy-waiting; periodic polling via timed sleep operations; or operating-system advisory yield calls. Specifically, having constant-time paths means contending threads wait on only one condition transfer of ownership - and have one waiting phase.

Such constructions are an example of the the Resource Acquisition is Initialization(RAII) [59] idiom. And in general, we observe that more flexible locking interfaces that allow context to be easily passed, outside of the lock body, will allow a broader range of lock algorithms to be deployed. Figure 3. LevelDB : readrandom contrast, locks such as MCS or HemLock may need to wait on additional conditions. ▶ Lifecycle management : In classic MCS the address of the owner's 'queue node' must be passed from an acquire operation to the corresponding release. Relatedly, that queue node must remain extant during the entire acquire-release period, and can not be use for other locking operations. In Reciprocating Locks, the element needs to remain extant only for the duration of the acquire operation, affording the implementer more latitude as to how and where the element is allocated. A singleton element allocated in thread- local storage suffices. ▶ Passing of context from acquire to release : Like MCS and CLH, Reciprocating Locks requires context to be passed from an acquire operation to the corresponding release. Broadly, any context is undesirable and to the extent possible, we might prefer context-free algorithms. In practice, it is common to keep required context in extra fields in the lock body (which can induce increased coherence traffic and increase the size of the lock) or in thread-local storage constructs that track which locks are held by a thread and can also be used to convey context. In managed runtime environments such as ▶ Handoff costs: Under sustained contention, CLH and MCS Release operators can perform handover without any need to access the central shared lock body, via direct threadto-thread communication that does not involve the lock. Reciprocating Locks, however, needs to occasionally consult the central lock arrivals pointer when the entry segment is found to be exhausted and must be reprovisioned. Compared to CLH and MCS, this can increase RMR complexity and generate additional coherence traffic. Interestingly, as we increase the number of contending threads, reciprocating locks will tend to enjoy longer segments and thus need to access the central arrival word less often. In addition, the conditional branch found in the release path of reciprocating locks - which tests whether the successor is nullptr - will tend to be less well-predicted when the segments are shorter. ▶ As to why Reciprocating Locks sometimes exceeds the performance of CLH, we make the following observations : (A) on NUMA systems, the waiting element in Reciprocating Locks is almost surely homed on same NUMA node as the associated thread, providing a performance benefit if home-based snooping is employed. Under CLH, the elements circulate. We note, however, that Reciprocating Locks still tends to outperform CLH on non-NUMA systems, although the difference is lessened.

Similarly, consider the step in CLH before the atomic exchange where a thread clears the flag in the element about to be installed via an atomic exchange. Assuming the implementation of CLH found in Figure 4.14 of [52], thread-local storage contains a pointer to the element, which in turn holds the flag. We find a load from thread-local storage to fetch the address of the element, followed by a dependent store into the element. Under Reciprocating Locks, threadlocal storage simply contains the flag proper, embedded in the WaitingElement , reducing indirection. We thus require just a store to prepare the element. Broadly, CLH requires more indirection because elements circulate. The address of the element to be installed via exchange, and the address of the element to be waited upon will, for a given thread, vary between iterations. In Reciprocating Locks, those addresses are fixed for the thread. (C) If we tally the minimum number of coherence misses in an idealized contended acquire-release episode, for CLH we have 5 : the store to prepare the element before the exchange; the exchange; the 1st load in the waiting phase after the exchange; the last load in the waiting phase when ownership is passed; and finally, the store in the release operation that conveys ownership. The store to prepare the element, prior to the exchange, causes a coherence miss as the last store to the body of that element was from a different thread, before the element migrated to the thread in question. (This miss occurs outside and before the critical section, but is still undesirable as it causes a stall and consumes interconnect bandwidth). For Reciprocating Locks, in Listing-1, we incur a simple shared → modified coherence upgrade at Line-17 (the line in already in shared state, because of the previous Acquire operation), a miss at Line-20 to exchange the address of the element, a miss at Line-30 when the busy-wait loop condition is ultimately satisfied and ownership is conveyed, and, in the Release operation, a miss at Line-58 when transferring ownership to the successor, for a total of 4 coherence misses. The misses at Line-17 and Line-30 are to memory expected to be homed on the same NUMA node as the thread.",

𝐴 completes the critical section and invokes Release , which, as the entry segment is empty, reverts to and detaches the arrival segment of 𝐵 + 𝐶 + 𝐷 + 𝐸 and moves those threads en-masse to entry segment, and then passes ownership to the head of the entry segment, 𝐵 .

  "9.2 Long-term Admission Unfairness": "While there is no long-term starvation, within the admission cycle 𝐴𝐵𝐶𝐷𝐸𝐷𝐶𝐵 we see that 𝐴 and 𝐸 are admitted just once while the others thread are admitted twice, which can manifest as long-term relative unfairness between the participating threads. While not a perfect palindrome, we say such a schedule is palindromic and note that the worst case admission unfairness that might manifest by virtue of the lock admission policy is 2 𝑋 - assuming constant offered load, the most favored thread can be admitted no more than twice as often as the most 'unlucky' thread. In general we find a bimodal distribution of progress over the participating threads.",
  "9.3 Cache residency": "In addition to simple admission, the palindromic schedule introduces an interesting secondary effect related to residual 2025-06-12 · Copyright Oracle and or its affiliates Reciprocating Locks cache residency. We assume a simple system model where all threads circulating over a lock access the same shared last-level cache (LLC). While threads are waiting, their residency in the LLC undergoes decay because of the actions of the other threads executing in the critical section or their respective non-critical sections. Arguably, a simple round-robin FIFO FCFS admission schedule results in the worst aggregate miss rate and thus the worst overall throughput. 11 . In contrast, the palindromic admission order can result in a better aggregate miss rate in the LLC. Yuan et al. [60] use the term 'sawtooth' for the pure palindrome schedule. In our case, the 'elements' are threads contending for a lock. Various threads, however, can experience persistent disparate LLC miss rates, yielding a different form of unfairness. Table 2. Example of a palindromic admission schedule",
  "9.4 Mitigation": "If desired, we can mitigate the unfairness from the effects above in a number of ways. A simple and expedient approach is to stochastically disrupt or perturb the repeating cycle, which reestablishes statistical long-term fairness. A viable technique is for incoming owners, having just acquired the lock, to run a thread-local Bernoulli trial, and based on the outcome, occasionally defer and immediately cede ownership to the next element in the entry segment, and propagate a reference to its wait element through the entry segment, where it will percolate to the tail, and eventually be re-granted ownership. This modification does not abrogate or otherwise violate our bypass guarantees or imperil anti-starvation as the reordering is strictly intra-segment. This particular approach, while expedient, surrenders the constant-time arrival property as a thread may need to wait in two phases during one acquisition episode, once to acquire ownership, and a 2nd time to be regranted ownership after it abdicated. More generally, if we simply pick random elements, without replacement, from the entry segment for succession, we 11 A simple analogy is sequential single-threaded code where an application needs to iterate over all elements of an array or linked list. A naive approach is to simply access the elements in ascending order until reaching the end, and then repeat, yielding a robin-robin order. Taking residual cache residency in account, however it is better to alternate ascending then descending orders - akin to a classic elevator seek or boustrophedonic order - which yields a palindrome access pattern. Such cache-friendly alternating direction optimizations are well known and appear in various sorting algorithms [57, 58] still retain the desirable population bounded anti-starvation property, statistically avoid long-term admission unfairness and cache residency fairness, and continue to enjoy aggregate miss rates (and throughput) that on average are the same or better than classic FIFO. Crucially, as all such reordering is intra-segment, we preserve our bounded bypass property.",
  "10 Conclusion": "Reciprocating Locks has a fully constant-time doorway phase and a constant-time Release , is practical and fulfills the criteria for general purpose locking. Reciprocating Locks is also architecturally informed as it works well with recent developments in modern NUMA cache-coherent communication fabrics. In the future, we plan on exploring the 'coherence traffic reduction' optimization (CTR), from HemLock, with Reciprocating Locks. Relatedly, using the Intel CLDEMOTE instruction or non-temporal stores to covey ownership may also act to reduce coherence traffic. Using modern architecturally enhanced waiting mechanisms such as MONITOR-MWAIT (Intel) or WFE (ARM) may also prove useful for situations where a thread waits for a local flag to toggle and then resets the flag, as we can instead wait for invalidation of a cache line and then use an atomic exchange to try to reset the flag, avoiding intermediate upgrades from MESI/MOESI shared to modified states. Finally, we are exploring techniques to impose long-term statistical admission fairness by means of randomizing or perturbing the order of the entry segment in order to break repeating palindromic admission schedules. Hemlock trades off improved space complexity against the cost of higher remote memory reference (RMR) complexity. Hemlock is exceptionally simple with short paths, and avoids the dependent loads and indirection required by CLH or MCS to locate queue nodes. The contended handover critical path is extremely short - the unlock operator conveys ownership to the successor in an expedited fashion. Despite being compact, it provides local spinning in common circumstances and scales better than Ticket Locks. Instead of traditional queue elements, as found in CLH and MCS, we use a per-thread shared singleton element. Finally, Hemlock is practical and readily usable in real-world lock implementations.",

  "A Naming": "The name Reciprocating Locks arises from the following analogy with a piston-based compressor or reciprocating pump. The pump's cylinder has distinct intake and exhaust ports and the piston is initially positioned at the bottom of the cylinder. Threads intending to acquire the lock - say, 𝐴 , 𝐵 and 𝐶 where 𝐴 was the first to arrive and 𝐶 last - arrive at the intake port and wait there. On the intake cycle, the piston pulls those threads from the intake port into the cylinder body. On the subsequent exhaust cycle, the piston expels the threads through the exhaust port. Passing through the exhaust port is analogous to passing through the lock's critical section. Like packets of air or gas, the threads are expelled from the cylinder through the exhaust port in an order reversed from that in which they originally arrived : 𝐶 then 𝐵 then 𝐴 . The entry segment corresponds to the current cylinder contents and the arrival segment reflects threads that reside in the intake manifold, before entering the cylinder. The non-critical section is where threads circulate back from the exhaust to the intake. The intake phase is analogous to detaching the current arrival segment and shifting those threads into the entry segment.",
  "B On-stack allocation of Wait Elements": "As described above, our implementation places wait elements in thread-local storage. This simplifies reasoning about memory correctness as the tenure and lifespan of thread-local storage is the same as that as the associated thread. We observe, however, that in many environments, wait elements can also be safely allocated on-stack, in the activation frame of Acquire . This approach reduces memory usage to 𝐾 ∗ 𝐸 + 𝐿 ∗ 𝐵 where 𝐾 is the number of waiting threads, 𝐸 is the size of the waiting element in the stack frame, 𝐿 is the number of currently extant locks, and 𝑆 is the size of the lock body. At a conceptual level, the element on which threads spin requires a short lifespan (tenure) and is only required to exist and remain in scope for the duration of the Acquire operation, and as such can be allocated in the Acquire function's frame. This is more convenient in terms of lifecycle than CLH or MCS. But, in some circumstances - zombies - we also use the address of an element as an end-of-segment marker. In this case the address escapes the frame as it passed through the Gate field. Specifically, the address of the wait element has a longer lifespan than the wait element itself, and the address persists even after the wait element has fallen out of scope. (Note that we use address-based comparisons to detect the end-of-segment, but never actually reference the defunct wait elements). An address escaping its frame or scope, and having a longer tenure or lifespan that its referent, is considered 'undefined behavior' in C++. In practice, though, we believe the technique is viable. If a given virtual address stack address remains associated with a given thread for the lifetime of the thread, as is the common case for pthreads environments, then the approach is safe. We note, however, that such onstack allocation might not be safe under exotic non-standard thread models where multiple lightweight threads can run or be 'mounted' on a given stack at different points in time, and stack addresses do not map to or otherwise convey thread identity in a stable fashion. If this particular aspect is a concern, the implementation could simply opt to adhere to our basic design and place the wait element into thread-local storage (TLS), which completely obviates the issue. Wealso note that modern compilers can detect such behavior, and generate warnings, and in some cases, to help protect against undefined behavior, will actively annul references that can be statically determined to fall out of scope. As a thread can wait on at most on lock at a time, and a wait element is only needed for the duration of an Acquire operation, using a singleton in thread-local storage is entirely sufficient. We are using 𝐸 's address for addressed-based comparisons as a distinguished marker to indicate the logical end-of-segment. 𝐸 itself will not be subsequently accessed.

  "C Potential Throughput Benefits from Palindromic Schedule Order": "We assume a simple system model where all threads circulating over a lock access the same shared last-level cache (LLC). While threads are waiting, their residency in the LLC undergoes decay - usually modelled as exponential - because of the actions of the other threads executing in the critical section or their respective non-critical sections. We consider a true repeating palindrome admission schedule, 𝐴𝐵𝐶𝐷𝐸 -𝐸𝐷𝐶𝐵𝐴 , as compared to the FIFO schedule of 𝐴𝐵𝐶𝐷𝐸 -𝐴𝐵𝐶𝐷𝐸 . Applying a simplistic decay model, when a thread ceases waiting and takes ownership of the lock, it incurs a 'cache reload transient'[53] where it suffers a burst of cache misses as it reprovisions the LLC with its own previously displaced private data. The residual residency fraction can be approximated as 𝑅𝑒𝑠𝑖𝑑𝑢𝑎𝑙 ( 𝑇 ) = 𝑒𝑥𝑝 (-𝑇 ∗ 𝜆 ) where 𝑇 is the sojourn or waiting time - the number of quanta since the thread last ran - and 𝜆 parameterizes the decay rate. 𝜆 is usually expressed as half-life . As 𝑅𝑒𝑠𝑖𝑑𝑢𝑎𝑙 is a convex function, we can employ Jensen's inequality [10] as follows. Taking thread 𝐵 as a specific example, its waiting times under the FIFO schedule is always 4 time units and under the palindrome schedule the waiting time alternate 2-6-2-6 etc. The average waiting time is the same under both schedules, but the average residual LLC residency when the thread resumes is the same or better under the palindrome schedule as 𝑅𝑒𝑠𝑖𝑑𝑢𝑎𝑙 ( 2 )+ 𝑅𝑒𝑠𝑖𝑑𝑢𝑎𝑙 ( 6 ) ≥ 𝑅𝑒𝑠𝑖𝑑𝑢𝑎𝑙 ( 4 )+ 𝑅𝑒𝑠𝑖𝑑𝑢𝑎𝑙 ( 4 ) . In fact, each and every thread will have the same or better residual fraction under the palindrome schedule than under FIFO although there will be disparity of benefits over the set of threads within the palindrome schedule. Intuitively, as the decay process is exponential in nature, the retained residency benefits accrued by the relatively short gap outweigh the decay penalty of the subsequent longer gap found in the palindrome schedule. The overall aggregate miss rate for the palindrome schedule, as computed over all the threads, will be less than that in the round-robin FIFO schedule, yielding better overall throughput. (Higher residency fractions implies reduced miss rates and better performance). Specifically, The palindrome schedule enjoys better overall aggregate LLC miss rates and throughput than a simple repeating round-robin FIFO schedule of 𝐴𝐵𝐶𝐷𝐸 -𝐴𝐵𝐶𝐷𝐸 . And in fact the FIFO schedule is pessimal for aggregate miss rate if we require equal fairness as measured over two back-to-back cycles. The same palindrome schedule effects on cache residency also apply by analogy to page working sets. Also by analogy, a simple uniprocessor scheduler would admit better cache residency using a palindrome schedule as compared to a classic FIFO round-robin schedule. Wecall out an analogy in simple sequential single-threaded code where an application needs to iterate over all elements of an array or linked list. A naive approach is to simply access the elements in ascending order until reaching the end, and then repeat, yielding a robin-robin order. Taking residual cache residency in account, however it is better to alternate ascending then descending orders - akin to a classic elevator seek or boustrophedonic order - which yields a palindrome access pattern. Such cache-friendly alternating direction optimizations are well known and appear in various sorting algorithms [57, 58]. Yuan et al. [60] use the term 'sawtooth' for the palindrome schedule. In our case, the 'elements' are threads contending for a lock. Considering a palindrome lock admission order of 𝐴𝐵𝐶𝐷𝐸 -𝐸𝐷𝐶𝐵𝐴 -𝐴𝐵𝐶𝐷𝐸... , for instance, we will have fair admission over the long term, but threads 𝐴 and 𝐸 will enjoy persistently lower shared cache miss rates than the other threads, imposing a different form of unfairness related to residual cache residency. Crucially, under the palidrome schedule, threads can incur disparate cache hits rates, reflecting a form of long-term cache-based unfairness, even if the the admission is long-term fair. The overall aggregate miss rate for the palindrome schedule, however, as computed over all the threads, will be less than that in the round-robin FIFO schedule. We note in passing that a random admission order is statistically long-term fair for both admission frequency and cache residency, and also will display a lower aggregate cache miss rate than FIFO. The same effects that apply to cache residency also have analogs in page working sets. As a coral ary to the above, if we as ume a set of threads equitably but otherwise distributed in a random fashion over a set of NUMA nodes, a palindrome admis ion order exhib ts, on average, fewer NUMA lock migrations than does a round-robin (FI O) order, making palindrome admis ion in ately NUMA-friendly without being specifical y NUMA-aware. ap ly by an logy to Palindrome-adjacent 2025-06-12 · Copyright Oracle and or its affiliates Dice and Kogan Les on, Informs, Instructs, Guides",
  "D Locking APIs": "Modern C++ locking constructs such as std::scoped_lock and std::lock_guard , by means of the Resource Acquisition is Initialization(RAII) [59] idiom, where the constructor acquires the lock and the destructor releases the lock, manage to avoid explicit lock and unlock calls in application code. This same design pattern readily supports underlying lock primitives that require context to be passed. Specifically, we can pass extra context through additional fields in the RAII wrapper classes. Likewise, locking interfaces that specify the critical section as a C++ lambda also allow such latitude. Interfaces that use scoped locking, such as Java's 'synchronized\" construct, permit the implementation to trivially pass information from the underlying lock cite to the corresponding unlock . If an implementation is forced to use a legay interface, such as that exposed via pthread_mutex_lock and pthread_mutex_ unlock , or C++ std::BasicLockable , but the lock algorithm is not context-free , then we can resort to passing context information through extra fields in the lock body, which are protected by the lock itself, and written and read only by the lock holder. This increases the size of the lock body and accesses to those fields can induce extra coherence traffic. Another approach is to keep track of held locks in thread-local storage (TLS) and convey the information in that fashion. Most locking algorithms that are not innately context-free can be transformed to become context-free through such techniques. We note that MCS and CLH also also must pass additional contextual information from Acquire to Release , so this concern is not specific to Reciprocating Locks. More modern interfaces,as noted above, may confer various advantages and obviate some of the concerns associated with passing context. We hope these observations serve to inform API designers, in that more flexible and liberal locking APIs may more easily accomodate a wider array of underlying lock algorithms, and afford more latitude to implementors.",
  "E Simplified Example": "In Listing-2 we show, for purposes of explication, a slightly simplified form of Reciprocating Locks, which is both easy to understand and implement. We recommend that implementors start with this version. This variant passes the identity of the successor ( succ ) as context. The identity of the terminus end-of-segment address is encoding via a global variable, eos , in the lock body. To reduce coherence traffic and false sharing between eos and Arrivals , we sequester and isolate eos as the sole occupant of its cache sector. Crucially, eos is not written during steady-state sustained contention, so does not tend to generate coherence misses in that circumstance.

  "F Variations": "All the implementations in this section employ a double swap arrival for uncontended operations. Arriving threads, as usual, use an atomic exchange (swap) to first install the address of their waiting element, 𝐸 . If the exchange returned nullptr , then the thread has gained ownership. In that case, to try to avoid 𝐸 becoming submerged, they immediately exchange LOCKEDEMPTY into the Arrival word. If that second exchanged returned 𝐸 , then the double swap was successful, and the thread can immediately enter the critical section. If other threads arrived between between two exchange operations, however, then 𝐸 become submerged and the second swap detached a new arrival segment, with 𝐸 residing at the 'far' end. Our thread needs to recover from that condition. In Listing-3, in the event of an arrival race, our thread, which is still currently the owner, simply cedes ownership to the most recently arrived thread on the newly detached segment, identified via 𝑅 (Line-56) and then proceeds to wait. This approach is extremely simple and avoids any need to use or convey end-of-segment information. The only context that needs to be passed to the Release phase is the address of the successor . This approach also preserves the desirable thread-specific bounded bypass property, but, arguably, it has poorer progress properties and is no longer constant-time as ownership needs to be relayed for the victim to 𝑅 . In practice we find the arrival race between the two swaps to be rare, likely as the window of vulnerability is short, and because it takes time for the coherent interconnect to re-arbitrate the cache line between processors. Also, the race can only occur at the onset of contention, when the first arriving thread found the lock not held and then other threads arrived in quick succession. As a trivial and racy counter-measure, to reduce the rate of double swap arrivals, in Acquire , we can first load the arrival word, and, if it is nullptr , conditionally attempt an atomic CAS to opportunistically try to swing the word to LOCKEDEMPTY . If the CAS is successful, the thread can return immediately, otherwise we let control fall through into the swap path. This may act to reduce the incidence of doubleswap operations for mostly uncontended locks. In theory the double swap serves to increase theoretical RMR complexity complexity [4, 7]. In practice, however, as the lock is uncontended, the underlying cache line tends to remain in local modified state in arriving thread's cache, so the second exchange incurs very little additional cost and no additional coherence misses. As noted above, the double swap is executed only absent contention, where the arriving thread found the lock in unlocked state. Under sustained contention, we avoid the double swap . In this particular variation we can safely allocate the waiting elements on stack, if desired, as the address of the element 𝐸 never escapes the Acquire phase, even if Acquire and Release are implemented as different functions. In Listing-4 we show another variation that uses only one atomic fetch-and-add(1) in the Release phase. This form significantly alters the encoding of the Arrival word, using the low-order two bits as a tag. This form avoids the need for an explicit LOCKEDEMPTY distinguished value, and also avoids the need to convey end-of-segment addresses through the chain. The only context that needs to be passed to the Release phase is the address of the successor on the detached entry segment. Listing-5 shows a variation where a thread retains ownership even if other threads arrived in the double swap or exchange -fetch-and-add window. In this case the second atomic in the putative uncontended arrival path - be it exchange or fetch-and-add - detached an arrival segment identified via 𝑅 (Line-40). The owner records 𝑅 as its successor, and also passes the address of 𝐸 through 𝑅 towards the tail of entry segment (Line-59). In this particular implementation, the end-of-segment eos field is used only at the onset of contention and only when the race occured in the arrival window, and eos is always otherwise nullptr . In addition, the use of eos is encapsulated and restricted to the Acquire phase, and eos does not need to communicated as context to the corresponding Release phase, resulting in a more simple and easy to understand algorithm. We note that approaches in Listing-3 and Listing-5 can easily be combined into a form that avoids the use of atomic fetch-and-add , yielding Listing-6. 2025-06-12 · Copyright Oracle and or its affiliates Reciprocating Locks 1 struct ReciprocatingLock { 2 struct WaitElement { 3 std::atomic< int > Gate alignas(128) {0} ; 4 } ; 5 6 Atomic <WaitElement *> Arrivals { nullptr } ; 7 static inline const auto LOCKEDEMPTY = 8 (WaitElement *) uintptr_t(1) ; 9 10 public : 11 inline auto operator+ (std::invocable auto && csfn) → void { 12 // Acquire Phase ... 13 // Can place E either on-stack or in TLS 14 // Consider alignas(128) 15 WaitElement E {} ; 16 auto succ = (WaitElement *) nullptr ; 17 auto tail = Arrivals.exchange (&E) ; 18 assert (tail ≠ &E) ; 19 // fast-path uncontended acquire 20 if (tail == nullptr ) { 21 auto R = Arrivals.exchange (LOCKEDEMPTY) ; 22 assert (R ≠ nullptr && R ≠ LOCKEDEMPTY) ; 23 if (R == &E) goto EnterCS ; 24 // Cede --Abdicate and fall thru into waiting phase ... 25 // Other threads arrived and pushed onto L → Arrivals in 26 // the Exchange-Exchange window, above 27 // Our &E is now burried in the arrival stack. 28 // We expect this scenario to be relatively rare. 29 // 30 // We recover and compensate by passing or diverting 31 // ownership directly to the thread associated with R. 32 // Our own element, E, which resides within the now-detached 33 // stack, will eventually gain ownership via natural 34 // succession. 35 // R is the most-recently-arrivated thread (at the time 36 // of the 2nd exchange, above) and is the head of that 37 // detached stack. 38 // 39 // This form arguably does _not provide a classic bounded 40 // wait-free transfer of ownership, as, in this path, 41 // ownership needs to pass transiently through this thread 42 // as an intermediary before reaching R. 43 // We relay ownership immediately to R. 44 // Succession and progress depend on this thread making 45 // progress to enable the actual successor, R. 46 // 47 // And in general, if a lock acquisition episode has 2 48 // distinct waiting phases or modes for a given thread, 49 // then we don't have have a constant-time doorway. 50 // 51 // And while simpler, this approach can generate 52 // more coherent communication traffic as ownership bounces 53 // from this thread and then immediately to the intended 54 // successor, R. 55 assert (R → Gate.load() == 0) ; 56 R → Gate.store (1, std::memory_order_release) ; 57 // fall through into normal waiting ... 58 } 59 60 // Coerce LOCKEDEMPTY to nullptr 61 // succ will be our successor when we subsequently release 62 succ = (WaitElement *) (uintptr_t(tail) & ~1) ; 63 assert (succ ≠ &E) ; 64 65 // slow path : contention --waiting phase 66 while (E.Gate.load(std::memory_order_acquire) == 0) { 67 Pause() ; 68 } 69 70 // Critical section expressed as lambda 71 // We pass \"succ\" as context from Acquire to corresponding Release 72 EnterCS: 73 assert (Arrivals.load() ≠ nullptr ) ; 74 csfn() ; 75 assert (Arrivals.load() ≠ nullptr ) ; 76 77 // Release Phase ... 78 // Case : entry list populated --appoint successor from entry list 79 // If successor exists on implicit Entrylist, 80 // just pass ownership to that waiting thread. 81 if (succ ≠ nullptr ) { 82 assert (succ → Gate.load() == 0) ; 83 succ → Gate.store (1, std::memory_order_release) ; 84 return ; 2025-06-12 · Copyright Oracle and or its affiliates Dice and Kogan Listing 3.

Regions colored blue represent ticket values already been granted ownership and no longer waiting, while those colored red are waiting for admission. Crucially, while the entry segment remains populated with waiting threads, the Release operator advances the grant field in a descending fashion, yielding a retrograde order. When grant reaches base , the entry segment is exhausted, and we reprovision the entry segment by setting base to top and top to ticket . That is, the arrival segment becomes the new entry segment. By convention, top and base are accessed only by the current lock holder and only within the Release operation. As we use magnitude-based comparisons, arithmetic rollover and aliasing of the ticket and grant becomes a concern. To address that issue we simply ensure that ticket -related fields are 64-bit integers. Assuming a processor could increment a value at most once per nanosecond, these fields would not overflow and wrap around in less than 200 years, so arithmetic overflow is not a practical concern. Assuming that std::atomic<int64_t>:fetch_add(1) is constant-time - which depends on both the library implementation of std::atomic and on the platform capabilities - our doorway phase is also also constant-time. Only one atomic readmodify-write fetch_add operation is required in Acquire and none in Release , and Release runs in constant-time. We are not constrained to simple retrograde admission order within the entry segment. Lets say our entry segment consists of threads 𝐴 -𝐵 -𝐶 -𝐷 which hold ticket values 1005 -1004 -1003 -1002, respectively. 𝐴 is the most recently arrived thread in the entry segment. Each thread waits for its corresponding ticket value to appear in the Grant field, which confers and conveys ownership. For retrograde admission, which mimics Reciprocating Locks, our admission order is 𝐴 then 𝐵 then 𝐶 then 𝐷 , using descending ticket values with the entry segment. A prograde admission order of 𝐷 then 𝐶 then 𝐵 then 𝐴 , with ascending ticket values, is tantamount to simple classic FIFO ticket locks. By using ticket values, we are able, in constant-time, to activate and enable a thread at any arbitrary position (offset) in the entry segment, unlike Reciprocating Locks where the order is dictated, as threads know only the identity of their immediate neighbor. Using ticket-based succession allows a wider variety of admission orders, compared to Reciprocating Locks, as ticket-base successor allows random access to the elements of the entry segment and thus more latitude for succession order. For example, a viable approach is the following. In the Release operator we run a biased Bernoulli trial, and, based on the outcome, select the successor from either the head of the remaining entry segment - the most-recently arrived thread - or the tail, which is the least recently arrived thread, but with the probability favoring the head. This yields a mostly LIFO admission order with the entry segment - mostly retrograde, but occasionally prograde. Crucially, we use the tunable Bernoulli probability to strike a balance between fairness over a period, and aggregate throughput. Such randomization is sufficient to break or perturb long-term unfairness arising from repeating palindromic admission cycles. As an optimization, to reduce the use of the random number generator, we can implement a per-lock CountDown variable. The Release operator always decrements the counter. If the value is found greater than zero, we extract a successor from the head of the entry segment. Otherwise, we extract a successor from the tail, compute a small uniform random integer in the range 1 ..𝑀 and then reset CountDown to that value. For our purposes, a simple low-latency low-quality pseudo-random generator number suffices, such as a singleword Marsaglia xor-shift variant[44]. A related technique is, in Release , when detaching a new arrival segment, to run a Bernoulli trial to pick a succession direction - prograde or retrograde but biased toward and favoring retrograde - and then use that direction for the entirety of the segment. These forms use randomization to provide long-term statistical avoidance of both unfair admission and unfair cache residency, but still provide better aggregate cache residency (and throughput) than simple FIFO while also retaining the desirable thread-specific bounded bypass property. For all the above, we can also borrow the waiting scheme from TWA and construct versions that avoid global spinning.
