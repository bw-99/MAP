Our empirical results indicate a preference among these models for hiring candidates with White female-sounding names over other demographic groups across 40 occupations.

Research spanning decades and continents has shown that discrimination based on race and gender are especially prevalent in employment practices (Darity Jr and Mason, 1998;Bielby, 2000), where Non-White minorities and women have consistently been subjected to hiring discrimination (Stewart and Perlow, 2001;Quillian and Midtb\u00f8en, 2021).\nBiased treatments are not limited to explicit characteristics-such as when a hiring official can directly observe the race or gender of a candidatebut are also be triggered by proxies, such as their names. Candidates with ethnically or racially distinct names have been subjected to employment discrimination: from getting lower callback rates to receiving less favorable reviews compared to their peers (Bursell, 2007;Stefanova et al., 2023).\nRecently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have become the leading architecture for many tasks in Natural Language Processing (NLP) (Kojima et al., 2022;Zhou et al., 2022;Chang et al., 2024). Despite their class-leading performance, LLMs have been shown to propagate and amplify different forms of bias in numerous domains (Wan et al., 2023;Gupta et al., 2023;Poulain et al., 2024;Salinas et al., 2023;Li et al., 2024b), similar to how more traditional predictive machine learningbased models replicate and exacerbate social biases (Mehrabi et al., 2021).\nIn this paper, we examine LLMs and their potential bias towards first names in making employment recommendations. More specifically, our experiments prompt LLMs to make hiring decisions and offer salary compensations for candidates with U.Sbased first names that signal their race and gender, sometimes in isolation, and sometimes with a biography that is otherwise scrubbed for demographic information. Our main findings are:\n\u22c4 Candidates with White-aligned names are preferred by GPT-3.5-Turbo and Llama 3 over other groups in 50% to 95% of 40 occupations, depending on the setting and model. \u22c4 Even when candidates possess identical qualifications as reflected in biographies, the average salary offered by these LLMs to candidates with female names may still differ up to 1.8% compared to their male counterpart's. This discrepancy reaches up to 5% when comparing candidates from intersectional groups. \u22c4 Biases exhibited by LLMs partially mirror real-world trends in the United States (U.S) labor force at coarse-grain levels. However, intersectional analysis reveals nuanced discrep-ancies that favor certain minority groups while punishing others, albeit inconsistently. Our work builds directly on that of Haim et al. (2024) and of An et al. (2024). Haim et al. (2024) prompted LLMs to provide assistance for 40 Black and White named individuals across topics related to sports, public office, purchasing etc., finding that Black female names received the worst outcomes. An et al. (2024) prompted LLMs to write emails to accept or reject job candidates with stereotypically White, Black or Hispanic names (across two genders), and investigated whether those emails chose to accept or reject the candidates. Their work found that acceptance rates for the latter 2 groups tend to be lower than the former, even when degrees of education and qualification level were consistently stated across candidates. Our work augments these findings by: 1) exploring alternative hiring-related tasks, including salary prediction with full, natural biographies-similar to \"r\u00e9sum\u00e9 studies\" in sociology-, and 2) by connecting LLM behaviors to real-world labor data to reveal intersectional bias with respect to a range of occupations.", "publication_ref": ["b42", "b41", "b16", "b5", "b8", "b1", "b31", "b25", "b3", "b30", "b15", "b45", "b4", "b39", "b13", "b24", "b28", "b21", "b14", "b0", "b14", "b0"], "figure_ref": [], "table_ref": []}, {"heading": "Hiring Recommendation", "text": "In this paper, we study two types of recommendations that LLMs could conceivably be applied.

We designate each occupation as male or female based on whether the percentage of names chosen by the LLM exceeds 50% for that gender. The Bureau's data is designated similarlyfoot_0 . Table 3 shows the contingency table between LLMs' hiring decisions and observed data. While the U.S labor evenly splits between male and female occupations, GPT-3.5 and Llama 3 prefer female names in 23 and 22 (out of 30) occupations respectively (\u2265 70%).\nRace-specific Analysis. Because the U.S survey designates Hispanic as an ethnicity that can be combined with any race, we compare the LLMs' distribution among the races White, Black, Asian only  (Bureau, 2023). By adjusting the percentages of the 3 races in the 2023 U.S labor force to include only non-Hispanic constituents, we calculate the Mean Absolute Errors (MAE) of the LLM-projected (%llm) distribution against recorded statistics (%us) per occupation to quantify the accuracy of the LLMs' demographic projections:\nMAE occupation = race |%us race -%llm race |3\nOverall, we find that GPT-3.5 follows U.S statistics more closely than Llama 3 in hiring distribution of for White, Black and Asian. GPT-3.5's average MAE across 30 occupations is 8.3 (\u03c3 = 5.2), lower than Llama 3's average MAE of 9.0 (\u03c3 = 7.8). For Hispanic group, we calculate Pearson correlation coefficient directly between LLM-projected percentage distribution and the U.S labor force's (Sedgwick, 2012). Llama 3's coefficient is 0.50, higher than GPT-3.5's 0.43 and congruent with the diversity observed in Table 1 andTable 2. Remarks. Our empirical results reveal that LLMs display a strong preference to hire White and female names when presented a diverse selection of candidates noted to possess similar qualifications.

We prompt the models 2 times for each candidate-occupation pair (over 320 names and 28 occupations) to account for potential variation, leading to a total of 17,920 prompts per model.\nRecommendation With Biographies. We edit biographies from the BiasinBios dataset to minimize potential confounding effects of gender-based expressions. For each of the 28 occupations, we randomly select 10 male and 10 female biographies and assign them a unique identifier (BioID).

We perform a t-test (\u03b1 = 0.05) to compare the salaries recommended to male vs female names per occupation with the null hypothesis H 0 : there exists no difference between the means of each group. For GPT-3.5, we reject H 0 and observe statistically significant differences (pvalue < \u03b1) between gender groups for only 4 out of 28 occupations. In contrast, Llama 3 show differences for 12 occupations.\nFigure 3 shows the percentages of difference between the mean salaries recommended to each gender group for the occupations with significant differences. GPT-3.5 offers female names more than their male counterparts for attorney, DJ, physician, and less for composer. Llama 3 offers female names less for 11 occupations, and more only for poet. Furthermore, Llama 3's average magnitude of gender-based discrepancy in salaries is 3.75%, significantly larger than GPT-3.5's 1.13%.\nWith Biographies For this setting, since the salaries for all individuals are nested at the biography level, we construct a Mixed-Effects Linear Model (MixedLM) with the Salary as the dependent variable, the names' Gender as the fixed independent variable, grouped by BioID to account for random variance within each biography. Male names serve as the reference group.\nFor each occupation, we calculate the percentage gap in salaries between genders using the formula:\nPercentage Gap = \u2206S f emale S ref \u00d7 100\nwhere S ref denotes the mean salary offered to the reference group (male in this case), \u2206S f emale denotes the average difference in salary offered to female names with respect to male names, as returned by the MixedLM model. Figure 4 illustrates only statistically significant gaps, where the MixedLM determines the associated p-values for both \u2206S f emale and S male to be less than \u03b1 = 0.05.\nAmong the 26 presented occupations, candidates with female names are consistently offered less than their male counterparts on average, with the reverse only true for DJ, model (Llama 3) and rapper (both LLMs).

We perform 1-way ANOVA tests to determine whether the mean salaries offered to the 8 intersectional groups differ meaningfully. Figure 5 illustrates the percentage gaps of the race-gender groups relative to the overall average salary for these occupations.\nOur first major observation is that White male names are offered more by both models. In all 9 occupations shown in Figure 5a, GPT-3.5 offers White male names salaries higher than average than all other groups. Similarly, Llama 3 favors this demographic in 9 out of 10 occupations to an even higher degree of discrepancy (Figure 5b). In contrast, Hispanic and Asian names, particularly female, tend to have offers lower than average at a higher magnitude across both models.\nSecond, GPT-3.5 shows smaller salary gaps compared to Llama 3. Pastor is the occupation with the largest gaps (from -3.31% for AM to 5.85% for WM), followed by physician and composer for GPT-3.5. For Llama 3, surgeon displays even larger discrepancy (-10.24% for BF to 13.29% for WM), with comedian, composer, physician and poet showing notable gaps. Llama 3 tend to give male names higher offers over female names of the same race. With Biographies. We construct another MixedLM analysis with similar setup as in previous section, but with race-gender as the independent variable and White male set as the reference group (\u03b1 = 0.05). The corresponding statistically significant differences in amounts offered to the other 7 race-gender groups (in percentage) are also displayed. Table 4 presents the aggregate number of occupations the LLMs offer these race-gender groups less (and more) than White male names. Figure 6 shows the corresponding scatter plots. Full numeric details are shown in Table 10 for all 28 occupations.\nCompared to their male counterparts, female names are offered lower salaries more frequently than White male names. In Table 4, White female names are almost always offered less than White male names by both GPT-3.5 and Llama 3. Black female names receive lower salary offers than White male names in 6 occupations by GPT-3.5 and 11 by Llama 3, while Black male names only do so in 1 and 2 occupations, respectively. Similar patterns are observed for Asian and Hispanic female vs. male names. Although their magnitudes vary, Llama 3 generally shows larger negative gaps for female names relative to White male names across occupations (Figure 6a).\nWe observe two major trends. First, compared to other non-White groups, Black names are offered more than White male names in significantly higher number of occupations. For the same gender and model, Black names outperform other non-White names in terms of the number of occupations where they are favored over White male names (No. Occ. More in Table 4). Second, overall, positive percentage gaps for names of all other race-gender groups relative to White male names cluster at approximately under 2%, though outliers exceeding 4% still exist (Figure 6b). Though not extremely large in magnitude, the very presence of these disparities in LLMs' behaviors is alarming as they can propagate inequality to stakeholders if deployed.

Black names get better offers than White male names more often than other non-White groups.

The latest published American Community Survey (ACS) in 2022 administered by the U.S Census Bureau reports the median earnings of various demographics across a range of occupations (U.S. Department of Labor, 2022). We collect and compare the available statistics for 18 out of 28 BiasinBios occupations with the median salaries recommended by the LLMs in the previous experiments (Table 9).\nOverall, we see that LLM-projected median salaries highly correlate with the U.S median earnings. While all Pearson correlation coefficients exceed 0.9 (Table 5), GPT-3.5-projected salaries' Mean Average Percentage Errors (MAPE) relative to their U.S reported counterparts are 13% to 30% less than Llama 3's, with also smaller standard deviation of errors, depending on whether candidates' biographies are presented. It is important to note that the increase in errors might be due to the high variance within our samples of biography.\nComparison of Gender Pay Gaps. As medians are robust against outliers, the LLM-recommended median salaries are almost identical across genders. Thus, we perform the following analysis using the LLM-projected mean salaries for 16 occupations against U.S reported statistics instead. 2We see that LLM-projected gender salary gaps are still significantly less than U.S data's on average. The 2022 ACS reports that females make more than males in only 3 of 16 occupations (dietitian, interior designer, paralegal), with the average absolute percentage gap between the median salaries of the 2 genders at 13.03% (Table 9). In contrast, the average gender gaps between LLMs' recommended mean salaries are all less than 1.01 \u00b1 0.82% (Table 6). The average MAEs with respect to U.S statistics remain consistent around 12 units for both LLMs with comparable variance.\nComparison of Intersectional Pay Gaps. We compare the overall median earnings of 8 intersectional groups as reported by the ACS 2022 in   els. In Figure 7, earnings (from U.S statistics) and salaries (from models) of all other groups are compared against White males' median earning. We observe that variance in LLM-projected salary differences is much narrower than corresponding U.S statistics. The range between the lowest median earning (Hispanic female) and the highest (Asian male) is 63%, while for all models, this figure does not exceed 5%. White male always receives the highest or second highest salary compared to other groups, regardless of setting. In contrast, Hispanic female is always the lowest or second lowest paid group. Despite being the highest earning group in the U.S, Asian male is never offered the highest salary by any LLM.\nAdditionally, Llama 3 recommends considerably higher salaries than GPT-3.5 and U.S statistics. While both models tend to offer each group higher salaries than the reported median earnings, Llama 3's mean offerings exceed the respective GPT-3.5's counterparts on average 9.5% without candidates' biography. This average jumps to 21.9 when biographies are presented ( Figure 7).\nRemarks. Discrepancies in recommended salaries further ascertain LLMs' implicit namebased bias. Observed gaps between offers made for candidates with identical biography are concerning, as they are evidence that names can solely be responsible for discrepant treatment. Though the gaps may be small compared to real-world data, they still pose a challenge towards ethical use of LLMs in practical scenarios.", "publication_ref": [], "figure_ref": ["fig_6", "fig_6"], "table_ref": ["tab_7", "tab_7"]}, {"heading": "Bias Mitigation Strategies", "text": "As our work reveals the potential LLM-propagated inequality in the allocation of employment due to first name preference, the discussion to reduce this bias becomes even more important.

These methods could be combined to target bias reduction at multiple checkpoints of deployment.\nPost-hoc Processing This approach relies on analysis done on the generated outputs of the models with respect to certain metrics (Cui et al., 2021). Post-hoc processing may involve humanin-the-loop as a checking-and-balance mechanism to regulate both human and machine factors (Gill et al., 2020).

In contrast, Black names are often overlooked in hiring, but are also offered salary higher than average. In comparison, White-aligned names are consistently preferred in both hiring and salary recommendation, with Hispanic names often on the opposite end. We surmise that this observation may be a potential byproduct of the alignment tuning process that many current LLMs undergo (Street, 2024;Ouyang et al., 2024). Further investigation is warranted to understand the underlying mechanism of this seemingly counterintuitive artifact.\nIntersectional bias needs to be closely examined. The gaps in salaries offered to male and female names by LLMs may not drastically differ at first glance. However, our intersectional analyses highlight significant disparity in offers dealt to non-White female names, particularly those of Hispanic background. Our findings further underscore the importance of intersectional analysis to uncover potentially unseen disparities.\nModel selection and calibration for use case is important to reduce bias. Our results showcase that prompting LLMs to choose one among several candidates arguably magnify the risk of preferential treatment, and thus should be avoided.
