Compared to the flat Euclidean space, the curved hyperbolic space provides a more amenable and embeddable room, especially for datasets exhibiting implicit tree-like architectures. However, the intricate nature of real-world tree-like data presents a considerable challenge, as it frequently displays a heterogeneous composition of tree-like, flat, and circular regions. The direct embedding of such heterogeneous structures into a homogeneous embedding space (i.e., hyperbolic space) inevitably leads to heavy distortions. To mitigate the aforementioned shortage, this study endeavors to explore the curvature between discrete structure and continuous learning space, aiming at encoding the message conveyed by the network topology in the learning process, thereby improving tree-likeness modeling. To the end, a curvature-aware hyperbolic graph convolutional neural network, \ud835\udf05HGCN, is proposed, which utilizes the curvature to guide message passing and improve long-range propagation.

They are widely observed in various real-world domains [1,3,44,53,64,101], such as recommendation systems, financial networks, and social networks.\nRecently, the utilization of hyperbolic space for modeling treelike structures has garnered substantial attention [11,24,45,56,57,61,65,90,96]. Compared with the zero curvature Euclidean space, one key property of negative curvature hyperbolic space is that it expand exponentially, making it can be considered as a continuous tree and vice versa (as shown in Figure 1). In other words, hyperbolic space allows for the efficient representation of a tree-like structure, as it enables nodes to be spread apart as they move away from the root, preventing crowding and overlapping of nodes as is commonly observed in Euclidean space. Additionally, hyperbolic space allows for exponential growth in the number of nodes in a given area, which is well-suited for modeling the exponential growth of trees.\nHowever, the real-world dataset often deviates from a pure tree configuration and manifests in a labyrinthine complexity, posing large challenges for tree-likeness modeling within hyperbolic space [82,103]. For instance, biological taxonomies, which depict the hierarchical relationships between different species from a for \ud835\udc47 2 . By incorporating curvature \ud835\udf05 into the neighboring aggregation, the detection of local structures is improved. This is achieved by assigning asymmetric weights (\ud835\udf05 1 \ud835\udc4e,\ud835\udc5c vs \ud835\udf05 1  \ud835\udc4e,\ud835\udc4f ) to nodes at different levels and results in larger values for nodes in a circular shape (\ud835\udf05 1  \ud835\udc4e,\ud835\udc5c vs \ud835\udf05 2 \ud835\udc4e,\ud835\udc5c and \ud835\udf05 1 \ud835\udc4e,\ud835\udc50 vs \ud835\udf05 2 \ud835\udc4e,\ud835\udc50 ).\nglobal view, often exhibit both extensive local flat regions where multiple species are closely related and local circular regions where species connections are less defined. The local structure of a treelike graph exhibits a heterogeneous blend of tree-like, flat, and circular patterns, resulting in difficulties in uniformly embedding the data into a homogeneous embedding space and thereby engendering structural biases and distortions.\nTo mitigate the limitations, this study seeks to examine the intersection between the discrete structure of the data and the continuous learning space. The aim is to encode the information inherent in the network topology in a manner that is both effective and imbued with structural inductive bias, thereby enhancing the performance of downstream tasks. From a geometric perspective, the quality of the embedding in geometric learning depends on the compatibility between the intrinsic graph structure and the embedding space [26]. In light of this principle, we employs the concept of curvature to guide tree-likeness modeling in hyperbolic space. As shown in Figure 2, the incorporation of curvature information offers a more comprehensive grasp of the local shape characteristics, facilitating the representation of the shape and contours of diverse regions within the learning space.\nIn Riemannian geometry, curvature measures the deviation of a geometric object from being flat, originally defined on continuous smooth manifolds [40]. Smooth manifolds with positive, zero, or negative curvature are spherical, Euclidean, and hyperbolic spaces, respectively. This concept has been extended to discrete objects such as graphs, where curvature describes the deviation of a local pair of neighborhoods from a \"flat\" case.\nGraph curvature, analogous to curvature in the realm of continuous geometry, consists of Gaussian curvature, Ricci curvature, and mean curvature. These components have unique roles: Gaussian curvature quantifies the local curvature at vertices, Ricci curvature allocates curvature to the edges, and mean curvature provides an overall metric for the entire graph. In this work, we focus on Ricci curvature for graph convolution and edge-based filtering. Several definitions have been proposed about Ricci curvature, including Ollivier Ricci curvature [58], Forman Ricci curvature [21], Balanced Forman curvature [74]. Ricci curvature controls the overlap between two distance balls by considering the radii of the balls and the distance between their centers [33]. Furthermore, the lower bound of Ricci curvature can reveal valuable global geometric and topological information [4]. It is also an effective indicator of treelike, flat, and cyclic areas, making it well-suited for integration into hyperbolic space to capture asymmetries, biases, and hierarchies.\nOverall, we put forward a novel framework: curvature-aware hyperbolic graph convolutional neural network (\ud835\udf05HGCN) for effectively modeling tree-like datasets with complex structures. Specifically, \ud835\udf05HGCN leverages the discrete Ricci curvature to guide message passing and dynamically adapts the global continuous hyperbolic curvature. Through empirical evaluations on diverse datasets and tasks, we confirm the superiority of the \ud835\udf05HGCN, as it consistently outperforms existing baselines by substantial margins.

The hyperbolic feature attention \ud835\udefc \ud835\udc56,\ud835\udc57 is defined as:\n\ud835\udefc \ud835\udc56,\ud835\udc57 = softmax \ud835\udc57 \u2208 N \ud835\udc56 MLP(log \ud835\udf05 o (h H \ud835\udc56 )\u2225 log \ud835\udf05 o (h H \ud835\udc57 )) .(9)\n4.1.3 Hyperbolic Non-linear Activation. After that, we apply a nonlinear activation:\nx \u2113,H \ud835\udc56 = \ud835\udf0e \ud835\udf05 \u2113 -1 ,\ud835\udf05 \u2113 ( h\u2113,H ) = exp \ud835\udf05 \u2113 o \ud835\udf0e (log \ud835\udf05 \u2113 -1 o ( h\u2113,H )) . (10\n)\nGeometric Intuition. The real-world tree-like graphs with heterogeneous local structures are inevitably distorted if we directly embed them into a homogeneous manifold. For instance, the embedding of quasi-cycle graphs such as \ud835\udc5b \u00d7 \ud835\udc5b square lattices (zero curvature) and \ud835\udc5b-node cycles (positive curvature) incur at least a multiplicative distortion of \ud835\udc42 (\ud835\udc5b/log \ud835\udc5b) in hyperbolic space [79]. Graph Ricci curvature is able to mitigate this distortion. The geometric intuition is that the more positive the curvature is, the more two distance balls centered at nearby points overlap, and therefore, the cheaper it is to transport the mass from one to the other. Theoretical results show that with the increasing number of triangles involved in the linked pair (\ud835\udc56, \ud835\udc57), the lower bound of curvature will be increased [33], as stated in Theorem 4.1. It is easy to understand because when the two vertices share many triangles, then the transportation distance should be smaller, and the curvature, therefore, is correspondingly larger. Theorem 4.1 (Lower bound of ORC [33]). On a locally finite graph, for any pair of neighboring vertices i, j, let #(\ud835\udc56, \ud835\udc57) := number of triangles which include \ud835\udc56, \ud835\udc57 as vertices for \ud835\udc56 \u223c \ud835\udc57. Then, we have the inequality, saying that\n\ud835\udf05 \ud835\udc56,\ud835\udc57 \u2265 -1 - 1 \ud835\udc51 \ud835\udc56 - 1 \ud835\udc51 \ud835\udc57 - #(\ud835\udc56, \ud835\udc57) \ud835\udc51 \ud835\udc56 \u2227 \ud835\udc51 \ud835\udc57 + -1 - 1 \ud835\udc51 \ud835\udc56 - 1 \ud835\udc51 \ud835\udc57 - #(\ud835\udc56, \ud835\udc57) \ud835\udc51 \ud835\udc56 \u2228 \ud835\udc51 \ud835\udc57 + + #(\ud835\udc56, \ud835\udc57) \ud835\udc51 \ud835\udc56 \u2228 \ud835\udc51 \ud835\udc57 , (11\n)\nwhere \ud835\udc60 + := max(\ud835\udc60, 0), \ud835\udc60 \u2228 \ud835\udc61 := max(\ud835\udc60, \ud835\udc61), \ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc51 \ud835\udc60 \u2227 \ud835\udc61 := min(\ud835\udc60, \ud835\udc61).\nIn this study, we make a theoretical analysis in Theorem 4.2, which further demonstrates the relations of ORC and embedding distance, i.e., when a large curvature is involved within the linked node, the closer of their embedding distance, which thus mitigates the distortion. Theorem 4.2 (Embedding Distance w.r.t ORC). Let (\ud835\udc56, \ud835\udc57) \u2208 \ud835\udc38 be the linked pair, h \ud835\udc56 , h \ud835\udc57 \u2208 R \ud835\udc51 be the node state in the tangent space, \ud835\udc51 \ud835\udc56 be the degree of node \ud835\udc56, and \ud835\udc37 be the distance of node \ud835\udc56 and node \ud835\udc57 in the tangent space, that is\n\ud835\udc37 = \u2225h \ud835\udc56 -h \ud835\udc57 \u2225,(12)\nwhere \u2225 \u2022 \u2225 is the Euclidean norm. Define a large ORC as \u03ba\ud835\udc56,\ud835\udc57 > max{1/\ud835\udc51 \ud835\udc56 , 1/\ud835\udc51 \ud835\udc57 } and a small ORC as \u03ba\ud835\udc56,\ud835\udc57 < min{1/\ud835\udc51 \ud835\udc56 , 1/\ud835\udc51 \ud835\udc57 }. Then, when the large ORC is involved, their embedding distance will get smaller if using \ud835\udf05HGCN. On the contrary, when the small ORC is involved, their embedding distance will get larger.\nProof. In the following, we use \ud835\udc37 \ud835\udc59 and \ud835\udc37 \ud835\udc60 to denote the distance when large and small curvature \u03ba are involved, respectively. The main idea is that when there is a large curvature involved, the node distance will be decreased compared with the original case (degreebased aggregation), that is \ud835\udc37 \ud835\udc59 < \ud835\udc37. At the same time, when there is a small curvature involved, the node distance will increase, that is \ud835\udc37 \ud835\udc60 > \ud835\udc37.\n(1) When a large curvature (i.e., \ud835\udf05 \ud835\udc56,\ud835\udc57 > max(1/\ud835\udc51 \ud835\udc56 , 1/\ud835\udc51 \ud835\udc57 )) is involved, more messages will be transferred, and we decompose the embedding, taking h \ud835\udc56 as an example, into two components: one is from original h \ud835\udc56 and another is the incremental parts from h \ud835\udc57 , then\n\ud835\udc37 \ud835\udc59 = \u2225(h \ud835\udc56 + \ud835\udefc \ud835\udc56 h \ud835\udc57 ) -(h \ud835\udc57 + \ud835\udefc \ud835\udc57 h \ud835\udc56 )\u2225 = \u2225(h \ud835\udc56 -\ud835\udefc \ud835\udc57 h \ud835\udc56 ) -(h \ud835\udc57 -\ud835\udefc \ud835\udc56 h \ud835\udc57 )\u2225,(13)\nwhere \ud835\udefc \ud835\udc56 (\ud835\udefc \ud835\udc57 ) is the difference between \u03ba\ud835\udc56,\ud835\udc57 and 1/\ud835\udc51 \ud835\udc56 ( 1/\ud835\udc51 \ud835\udc57 ), i.e., \ud835\udefc \ud835\udc56 = \u03ba\ud835\udc56,\ud835\udc57 -1/\ud835\udc51 \ud835\udc56 , \ud835\udefc \ud835\udc57 = \u03ba\ud835\udc56,\ud835\udc57 -1/\ud835\udc51 \ud835\udc57 . Since \u03ba\ud835\udc56,\ud835\udc57 > max(1/\ud835\udc51 \ud835\udc56 , 1/\ud835\udc51 \ud835\udc57 ), \ud835\udefc \ud835\udc56 and \ud835\udefc \ud835\udc57 are both positive. Let \ud835\udefc \ud835\udc56 \ud835\udc57 = \ud835\udefc \ud835\udc56 \u2248 \ud835\udefc \ud835\udc57 , then\n\ud835\udc37 \ud835\udc59 \u2248 \u2225(h \ud835\udc56 -\ud835\udefc \ud835\udc56 \ud835\udc57 h \ud835\udc56 ) -(h \ud835\udc57 -\ud835\udefc \ud835\udc56 \ud835\udc57 h \ud835\udc57 )\u2225 = (1 -\ud835\udefc \ud835\udc56 \ud835\udc57 )\u2225h \ud835\udc56 -h \ud835\udc57 \u2225 < \ud835\udc37.(14)\nThen, we easily know that when large curvature is involved, the distance will be reduced and two nodes will be closer to each other. What's more, the larger the curvature, the closer the nodes are.\n(2) Similarly, when a small curvature (\ud835\udf05 \ud835\udc56,\ud835\udc57 < min(1/\ud835\udc51 \ud835\udc56 , 1/\ud835\udc51 \ud835\udc57 )) is involved, fewer messages will be transferred, and we decompose the embedding, taking h \ud835\udc56 as an example, into two components: one is from original h \ud835\udc56 and another is the reduction parts of h \ud835\udc57 , that is\n\ud835\udc37 \ud835\udc60 = \u2225(h \ud835\udc56 -\ud835\udefd \ud835\udc56 h \ud835\udc57 ) -(h \ud835\udc57 -\ud835\udefd \ud835\udc57 h \ud835\udc56 )\u2225 \u2248 (1 + \ud835\udefd \ud835\udc56 \ud835\udc57 )\u2225h \ud835\udc56 -h \ud835\udc57 \u2225 > \ud835\udc37,(15)\nwhere \ud835\udefd \ud835\udc56 is the difference between 1/\ud835\udc51 \ud835\udc56 and \u03ba\ud835\udc56,\ud835\udc57 , i.e., \ud835\udefd \ud835\udc56 = 1/\ud835\udc51 \ud835\udc56 -\u03ba\ud835\udc56,\ud835\udc57 , \ud835\udefd \ud835\udc57 = 1/\ud835\udc51 \ud835\udc57 -\u03ba\ud835\udc56,\ud835\udc57 . Both \ud835\udefd \ud835\udc56 and \ud835\udefd \ud835\udc57 are positive in that \ud835\udf05 \ud835\udc56,\ud835\udc57 < min(1/\ud835\udc51 \ud835\udc56 , 1/\ud835\udc51 \ud835\udc57 ). Let \ud835\udefd \ud835\udc56 \ud835\udc57 = \ud835\udefd \ud835\udc56 \u2248 \ud835\udefd \ud835\udc57 , then, we easily know that when small curvature is involved, the node pair will become more distant in the embedding space. What's more, the smaller the curvature, the more distant the nodes are. \u25a1", "publication_ref": ["b93", "b78", "b32", "b32"], "figure_ref": [], "table_ref": []}, {"heading": "Curvature-based Homophily Constraint", "text": "In the degree-based learning paradigm, like GCN [35], the influence of a node on another node decays exponentially as their graph distance increases as shown by [31].

The hyperbolic message passing learning paradigm of \ud835\udf05HGCN also shows a similar phenomenon, which causes too much influence loss in long-term propagation. Especially, if the paths consist of numerous connections to other nodes, the node influence is minimal. For clarity, we term the hyperbolic message passing learning paradigm in \ud835\udf05HGCN or original HGNNs [11,45,96] as HMP.

Recall the aggregation rule in Equations ( 6) and ( 7) (similar to that in origin HGNNs), we focus on the aggregation in the tangent space and ignore the previous logarithmic map and the later exponential map since they are applied before and after the whole aggregation process, respectively.

We evaluate \ud835\udf05HGCN on both node classification and link prediction tasks. The data split is the same with the previous works [11].

For node classification, we split nodes into 70%, 15%, 15% for Airport, 30%, 10%, 60% for Disease, and we use 20 labeled train examples per class for Cora, and PubMed. Implementation details. We closely follow the parameter settings as HGCN [11], fix the number of embedding dimensions to 16 and then perform hyper-parameter search on a validation set over learning rate, weight decay, dropout, and the number of layers. We also adopt the early stopping strategies based on the validation set as [11].

The experimental results of node classification are summarized in TABLE 3, where a lower hyperbolicity value corresponds to a more tree-like structure. The key findings are: (1) Overall, the proposed model performs impressively, surpassing previous models on four out of five datasets. Specifically, hyperbolic models (e.g., HGCN, LGCN) perform substantially better on the more hyperbolic dataset (e.g., Disease) than on the less hyperbolic dataset; Euclidean models (e.g., GCN, GAT) find more success on the less hyperbolic datasets (e.g., Cora) than on the more hyperbolic dataset; whereas our model performs better on both datasets, which is consistent with our motivation, namely, that the graph can be better learned under the guidance of curvature. In addition, from the improvements of \u0394 \ud835\udf05 , we discovered that CurvGN with discrete curvature and \ud835\udf05GCN with continuous curvature both perform worse than our method which validates the power of hyperbolic geometry and the curvature-aware learning. (3) When it comes to Cora, both hyperbolic models and the proposed \ud835\udf05HGCN fail to outperform Euclidean GAT [78], indicating Euclidean geometry is more suitable for modeling data with scarcely hierarchical structures. Nevertheless, it is noted that \ud835\udf05HGCN still outperforms well-known Euclidean GCN models, e.g., GCN [35], SGC [83], SAGE [28]. It is observed that the proposed method \ud835\udf05HGCN also helps to narrow down the gap between hyperbolic models and Euclidean GAT.\nLink Prediction. The experimental results of link prediction tasks are summarized in TABLE 4. In the link prediction task, we further have the following observations: (1) Compared with Euclidean 4 The results on Lorentz model are similar. counterparts, Our proposed \ud835\udf05HGCN, and other hyperbolic models have achieved better performance. It is because hyperbolic space owns a larger embedding space, where the structural dependencies could be well preserved by the link prediction loss, providing more space or boundary for nodes to be well arranged; (2) In comparison with the advanced hyperbolic models, our model also obtains remarkable gains and refresh the records. According to the above extensive experiments, we are safe to conclude that equipping ORC with hyperbolic geometry further improves its generalization ability, obtaining high-quality representations for both tree-like and non-tree-like structured data. This confirms our primary motivation that the curvature carries rich information which is beneficial for graph representation learning in the embedding manifold. Specifically, incorporating the structure information featured by ORC helps the models developed in a continuous manifold with negative curvature to perceive the role of each node, accelerating the learning procedure, and reducing the distortion for graph embedding of less hierarchical networks.", "publication_ref": ["b0", "b77", "b34", "b82", "b27", "b1"], "figure_ref": [], "table_ref": ["tab_3", "tab_4", "tab_3"]}, {"heading": "Effectiveness of Aggregations", "text": "In Section 4.1, we introduce two tangential aggregation strategies: the curvature-based approach (denoted as Curv) and the featureaugmented method (denoted as CurvAtt).

This phenomenon can be understood as follows. Adding \ud835\udf05HC as in node classification will force linked nodes to obtain more similar representations. For the pure tree-like dataset, i.e., DISEASE (without any triangle and circle), these node pairs belong to different levels, and adding \ud835\udf05HC impairs the learning of asymmetric dependencies, which further affects the establishment of hierarchical awareness.

We can take the derivative of \ud835\udc50 with respect to the loss, i.e., \ud835\udf15\ud835\udc3f (y,\u0233) \ud835\udf15\ud835\udc50 = \ud835\udf15 (y,\ud835\udf05HGCN(x,\ud835\udf05,\ud835\udf03,\ud835\udc50 ) ) \ud835\udf15\ud835\udc50\n. It is easy to see that the update of \ud835\udc50 is constrained by \ud835\udf05. In other words, we learn a good embedding space equipped with curvature \ud835\udc50 that matches the graph structure through discrete Ricci curvature \ud835\udf05.", "publication_ref": [], "figure_ref": [], "table_ref": []}], "references": [{"ref_id": "b0", "title": "Metric tree-like structures in realworld networks: an empirical study", "journal": "Networks", "year": "2016", "authors": "Muad Abu;
