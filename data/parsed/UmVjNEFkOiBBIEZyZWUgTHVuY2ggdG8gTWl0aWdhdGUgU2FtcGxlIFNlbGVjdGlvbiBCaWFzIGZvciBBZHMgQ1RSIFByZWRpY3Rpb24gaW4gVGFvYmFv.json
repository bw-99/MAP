  "ABSTRACT": "to rank them based on expected Cost Per Mille (eCPM) [31]: Click-Through Rate (CTR) prediction serves as a fundamental component in online advertising. A common practice is to train a CTR model on advertisement (ad) impressions with user feedback. Since ad impressions are purposely selected by the model itself, their distribution differs from the inference distribution and thus exhibits sample selection bias (SSB) that affects model performance. Existing studies on SSB mainly employ sample re-weighting techniques which suffer from high variance and poor model calibration. Another line of work relies on costly uniform data that is inadequate to train industrial models. Thus mitigating SSB in industrial models with a uniform-data-free framework is worth exploring. Fortunately, many platforms display mixed results of organic items (i.e., recommendations) and sponsored items (i.e., ads) to users, where impressions of ads and recommendations are selected by different systems but share the same user decision rationales. Based on the above characteristics, we propose to leverage recommendations samples as a free lunch to mitigate SSB for ads CTR model (Rec4Ad). After elaborating data augmentation, Rec4Ad learns disentangled representations with alignment and decorrelation modules for enhancement. When deployed in Taobao display advertising system, Rec4Ad achieves substantial gains in key business metrics, with a lift of up to +6.6% CTR and +2.9% RPM.",

Hence, CTR prediction serves as a fundamental component for online advertising systems. Figure 1: An illustration of the serving and updating process for CTR model in a typical online advertising system. CTR Model Candidate Select Display Feedback Update inference space training space User 1 2 3 4 5 As shown in Fig. 1, a production CTR model scores all candidates and selects the top few based on Eq. (1) for display. The displayed ads as well as user feedback (i.e., click/non-click) are then recorded, with which we continuously train new models. Due to its simplicity and robustness, such a training paradigm is widely adopted by many industrial systems [1, 19, 21]. However, since the displayed ads are not uniformly sampled from all candidates but purposely selected by the model itself, the training data distribution could be skewed from the inference distribution. This is widely known as the sample selection bias (SSB) problem [13, 32]. It violates the classical assumption of training-inference consistency and may potentially affect the model performance. Recent efforts [20, 22, 24, 28, 31] have been devoted to alleviating SSB in ranking systems. Methods based on Inverse Propensity Scoring [22, 24, 28] recover the underlying distribution by re-weighting the training samples. Despite theoretical soundness, they require a propensity model that accurately estimates sample occurrence probability, which is difficult to learn in dynamic and complicated environments. Moreover, sample re-weighting may yield un-calibrated predictions that are problematic for ads CTR models [30]. Another line of work collects uniform data via random policy, which helps train an unbiased imputation model for non-displayed items [31] or guide the CTR model training via knowledge distillation [20]. However, even small production traffic (e.g., 1%) of the uniform policy will severely cause degraded user experience and revenue loss, and the obtained uniform data of this magnitude is insufficient for training industrial models with billions of parameters.

Under this framework, recommendation samples are retrieved and mixed with ad samples for training. With raw feature embeddings, we elaborately design the representation disentanglement mechanism to dissect system-specific confounders and system-invariant user-item interest across two systems. Specifically, this mechanism consists of an alignment module and a decorrelation module with various regularizations. Finally we make prediction with disentangled and enhanced representation.

Fea#1 Fea#N Pre-Batching Inspired by causal learning [2, 29], CTR prediction can be framed as the problem of treatment effect estimation. As in Fig. 2(B), sample features compose unit X , whether to display it acts as a binary treatment T and click is the outcome Y to estimate. The root cause of SSB is attributed to existence of confounders ∆ (e.g., item popularity) in X that affect both T and Y . Recent studies [9, 14] show that confounders mislead models to capture spurious correlations between the unit features and the outcome, which are non-causal and hurt generalization over the inference distribution. Hence, it is promising to mitigate SSB by disentangling confounders ∆ from real user-item interest Γ in sample features, which is non-trivial in absence of randomized controlled trials (i.e., uniform data) [23]. ...

For clarity, we refer to sponsored items as ads . We refer to organic items as recommendations . This scenario has two characteristics: · Shared decision rationales. With a unified interface design, users are unaware of whether items are sponsored or organic, making their click decision determined by real user-item interest Γ rather than sources of displayed items. · Different selection mechanisms. Advertising and recommendation systems serve different business targets (e.g., revenue/clicks/dwell time) [10] and have different selection mechanisms as verified in Sec. 2.2. Thus their SSB-related confounders are rarely overlapped, making system-specific confounders ∆ad / ∆rec capture a substantial portion of ∆ . The above characteristics make it possible to disentangle ∆ad / ∆rec and Γ by jointly considering samples from two sources. Compared with the uniform data, recommendation samples are of a comparable or even larger magnitude than ads samples and persist without revenue loss, making it a free lunch worthy of exploitation.

Besides item-level features like category and brand, 𝑎 also has campaign-level features including ID and historical statistics, denoted by { 𝑎 1 , ..., 𝑎 𝑛 } . · Each impression in 𝐷 𝑎𝑑 is a tuple ( 𝑢, 𝑎, 𝑐, 𝑦 ) describing when the advertising system displayed 𝑎 to 𝑢 under context 𝑐 = { 𝑐 1 , .., 𝑐 𝑘 } such as time and device, user clicked it ( 𝑦 = 1) or not ( 𝑦 = 0). As for 𝐷 𝑟𝑒𝑐 , the tuple changes to ( 𝑢, 𝑖, 𝑐, 𝑦 ) logged by the recommendation engine.

  "2.2 Analysis of Sample Selection Bias": "2.2.1 SSB in Ads Impressions. SSB happens when each candidate does not share equal opportunities for impression. To examine its existence, we define the metric of impression ratio (IR) to measure the opportunity of each ad in our system:  where a session refers to a user request.

As defined before, each ad in A corresponds to an organic item in I . Thus we investigate how impressions in 𝐷 𝑟𝑒𝑐 are distributed among organic items with ad counterparts. From Fig. 5 (Left), we find that though some groups of ads have few impressions in 𝐷 𝑎𝑑 , their corresponding items contribute an important portion of impressions in 𝐷 𝑟𝑒𝑐 . It is attributed to different selection mechanism behind 𝐷 𝑎𝑑 and 𝐷 𝑟𝑒𝑐 . We conduct a simulated study on 𝐷 𝑎𝑑 for verification, which changes the ranking function from 𝑝𝑐𝑡𝑟 ∗ 𝑏𝑖𝑑 to 𝑝𝑐𝑡𝑟 (commonly adopted in recommendation systems) and redisplays top-10 ads. Fig. 5 (Right) illustrates IR of each original rank under two mechanisms. It is clear that impression distribution is changed, where ads with low rank in original list have opportunities to be displayed under another mechanism .

Since base CTR model is trained on 𝐷 𝑎𝑑 , we analyze its ranking and calibration performance under the imbalanced ad impressions.

  "3 METHODOLOGY": "User Behavior Sequence User Profile Target Ad Sample Indicator Retrieval Mapping Ad Data Augmentation Fig. 3 shows two stages of Rec4Ad in deployment: data augmentation and disentangled representation learning , which constructs and leverages recommendation (rec) samples, respectively.",
  "3.1 Data Augmentation": "3.1.1 Retrieving Recommendation Samples. To ensure user experience, the percentage of ad impressions in all impressions is usually limited to a low threshold. Typically, we have | 𝐷 𝑎𝑑 | ≪ | 𝐷 𝑟𝑒𝑐 | , making it intractable to consume entire 𝐷 𝑟𝑒𝑐 owing to multiplied training resources. Moreover, not all rec samples are useful for enhancing ads model due to difference between A and I . Thus we retrieve rec samples that are closely related to advertising system. Let 𝐼 ( 𝑎 ) ∈ I denote the item that 𝑎 ∈ A is advertised for. We define an item set I 𝑎𝑑 containing all items with related ads:  that model tends to perform worse on ads with lower IR than on those with higher IR . It is consistent with our assumption that model does not generalize well on ads with few impressions and validates the necessity to handle SSB for improvement. Conference acronym 'XX, June 03-05, 2023, Woodstock, NY Gao, et al. We discard rec samples whose items fail to occur in I 𝑎𝑑 , since they fail to provide complementary impressions that relate to any ad of interest. In this way, we retrieve a subset of rec samples:  3.1.2 Pseudo Sample Mapping. The reasons to map retrieved rec samples to pseudo ad samples are two-fold. First, it allows rec samples and ad samples to have uniform input format, which facilitates efficient feature joining and batch processing. Second, pseudo samples scattering in the U × A space help learn a CTR prediction model for ads, compared with the U×I space. In Fig. 3, we maintain an item-ads index where key is item 𝑖 and values are their related ads 𝐴 ( 𝑖 ) = { 𝑎 ∈ A| 𝐼 ( 𝑎 ) = 𝑖 } . To select an ad from 𝐴 ( 𝑖 ) , we do not take their impressions into consideration, which avoids introducing selection bias in the advertising system. Instead, we adopt a recent𝐾 -random strategy. We randomly select an ad 𝑎 ′ from most recent 𝐾 ads related to 𝑖 , where 𝐾 is a fixed hyperparameter. After mapping, we obtain the set of pseudo samples:",
  "3.2 Disentangled Representation Learning": "3.2.1 Original Representation. we embed raw features of sample ( 𝑢, 𝑎, 𝑐, 𝑦 ) into low-dimensional vectors [ 𝑒 ( 𝑢 ) , 𝑒 ( 𝑎 ) , 𝑒 ( 𝑐 )] . Operations like attention mechanism [34] are further employed to aggregate embeddings of user behavior sequences. We concatenate these results together to obtain intermediate representation e . Batch Normalization (BN) [15] is commonly used in training of industrial CTR models [25] to stabilize convergence. It calculate statistics over training data for normalization during serving. However, when incorporating 𝐷 ˜ 𝑟𝑒𝑐 into training, BN statistics are calculated based on ad and rec samples but only used to normalize ad samples during online serving. The distribution discrepancy between two kinds of samples weakens the effectiveness of BN. To deal with this problem, we design source-aware BN (SABN), which adaptively normalize samples according to their sources. Let 𝑠 indicate which kind the sample is, SABN works as follows:  where 𝛾 𝑠 , 𝛽 𝑠 , 𝜇 𝑠 , 𝜎 2 𝑠 are source-specific parameters for normalization. Then we feed the normalized representation e ′ into MLP (Multi-Layer Perception) layers for a compact representation x that captures feature interactions among user, ad, and context. We add superscripts on representations (e.g., x 𝑎𝑑 / x 𝑟𝑒𝑐 ) to denote its source. 3.2.2 Alignment. Since users are usually unaware of the difference between ad and rec impressions, their click decisions can be assumed independent of underlying systems, which are commonly determined by their interest. To identify user-item interest Γ behind click decision, we propose to extract invariant representations shared between 𝐷 𝑎𝑑 and 𝐷 ˜ 𝑟𝑒𝑐 . In other words, samples in 𝐷 𝑎𝑑 and 𝐷 ˜ 𝑟𝑒𝑐 should be indistinguishably distributed in the invariant representation space. To achieve this goal, we first apply projection layers over original representations of ad and rec samples:  A direct method to align { x 𝑎𝑑 𝑖𝑛𝑣 } and { x 𝑟𝑒𝑐 𝑖𝑛𝑣 } is minimizing their Wasserstein or MMD distribution distance [7, 11]. However, these metrics are computationally inefficient and hard to estimate accurately over mini-batches. Instead, we train a sample discriminator 𝐻 to implicitly align them in an adversary way. Particularly, 𝐻 is a binary classifier that predicts whether the sample is from 𝐷 𝑎𝑑 or 𝐷 ˜ 𝑟𝑒𝑐 based on x 𝑖𝑛𝑣 . Optimized with cross entropy loss, 𝐻 aims to distinguish two kinds of samples as accurate as possible:  While 𝐻 tries to minimize 𝐿 𝐴 during training, neural layers generating invariant representations aim to make { x 𝑎𝑑 𝑖𝑛𝑣 } and { x 𝑟𝑒𝑐 𝑖𝑛𝑣 } indistinguishable as much as possible, i.e., maximize 𝐿 𝐴 . To train these two parts simultaneously, we insert a gradient reverse layer (GRL) [8] between x 𝑖𝑛𝑣 and the discriminator. In forward propagation, GRL acts as an identity transformation. In backward propagation, it reverses gradients from subsequent layers: Forward : 𝐺𝑅𝐿 ( x 𝑖𝑛𝑣 ) = x 𝑖𝑛𝑣 ,  where 𝛼 controls the scale of reversion. In this way, we tightly align { x 𝑎𝑑 𝑖𝑛𝑣 } and { x 𝑟𝑒𝑐 𝑖𝑛𝑣 } in the invariant representation space. 3.2.3 Decorrelation. To separate system-specific confounders from original representation, we apply another set of projection layers:  If without explicit constraints, x 𝑐𝑜𝑛 could still contain information shared across systems and prevent us from handling confounders specific to the ad system. To this end, we propose to add regularizations to further disentangle x 𝑐𝑜𝑛 and x 𝑖𝑛𝑣 . Borrowing the idea that disentangled representations avoid encoding variations of each other [5, 6], we penalize the cross-correlation between two sets of representations. Specifically, let p 𝑖 denote the in-batch vector of 𝑖 -th dimension of x 𝑖𝑛𝑣 and q 𝑗 denote that of 𝑗 -th dimension of x 𝑐𝑜𝑛 , their Pearson correlation can be calculated as: 𝐶𝑜𝑣 ( p 𝑖 , q 𝑗 )) = [ p 𝑖 - ¯ pi ] ⊤ [ q 𝑗 - ¯ qj ] ,  where ¯ pi and ¯ qj denote in-batch mean of each dimension. Thus the objective of the decorrelation module are based on correlations of every pair of dimension cross x 𝑖𝑛𝑣 and x 𝑐𝑜𝑛 :  By optimizing 𝐿 𝐷 , x 𝑐𝑜𝑛 are encouraged to capture residual information independent from x 𝑖𝑛𝑣 , i.e., system-specific confounders ∆ad / ∆rec that are discarded by the alignment module.",

For simplicity, we use the concatenation operator:  With x 𝑠 𝑛𝑒𝑤 , we make predictions for ad samples and pseudo samples with source-aware layers, where cross entropy loss 𝐿 𝐶 is optimized:  Thus the objective function of Rec4Ad consists of the CTR prediction loss, the alignment loss and the decorrelation loss:",
  "4 EXPERIMENTS": "",
  "4.1 Experimental Setup": "Taobao Production Dataset. We construct the dataset based on impression logs in two weeks of 2022/06 from Taobao advertising system and recommendation system. We use data of the first week for training, which contains ad and rec impressions collected under regular policy. The data of the next week are ad impressions collected under random policy of a small traffic following [20, 31], which is used to evaluate model performance against SSB. The training dataset contains 1.9 billion ad samples and 0.6 billion rec samples after retrieval, covering 0.2 billion users. The test dataset contains 18.9 million ad samples and 10.3 million users. Baselines. Rec4Ad is compared with following baselines. · Base . We adopt DIN [34] as the vanilla model which does not account for SSB. · DAG . The Data-Augmentation (DAG) method directly merges rec samples and ad samples to train the base model. · IPS [16, 24]. It eliminates SSB by re-weighting samples with inverse propensity of ad impression. · IPS-C [3] It adds max-capping to IPS weight so that its variance can be reduced. · IV [26]. It employs user behaviors outside current system as instrumental variables for model debiasing. Metrics. For ranking ability, we use the standard AUC (Area Under the ROC Curve) metric for evaluation [12, 18]. A higher AUC indicates better ranking performance. In practice, absolute improvement of AUC by 0.001 on the production dataset is considered significant, which empirically leads to an online lift of 1% CTR . For calibration, we evaluate models with the ECE [30] metric. We first equally partition the 𝑝𝑐𝑡𝑟 range [0,1] into 𝐾 buckets 𝐵 1 , ..., 𝐵 𝐾 . ECE can be calculated as follows:  where 𝟙 ( ˆ 𝑦 𝑖 ∈ 𝐵 𝑘 ) equals 1 only if ˆ 𝑦 𝑖 ∈ 𝐵 𝑘 else 0. 𝐾 is set to 100. A lower ECE here indicates better calibration performance. Implementation The feature embedding size is 16. We use Adam optimizer [17] with initial learning rate 0 . 001. The batch size is fixed to 6000. In data augmentation, we consider the most recent 3 ads for pseudo sample mapping. The dimensions 𝑑 of x 𝑖𝑛𝑣 and x 𝑐𝑜𝑛 is 128. The ratio 𝛼 of gradient reverse layer in Eq. (9) is 0.1. 𝜆 1 and 𝜆 2 for the alignment and the decorrelation loss in Eq. (15) is 0.005 and 0.5. For tests of significance, each experiment is repeated 5 times by random initialization and we report the average as results.",
  "4.2 Experimental Results": "Table 1: Performance Comparison of Rec4Ad and baselines. The symbol * indicates the improvements over baselines are significant with p-value < 0.01 by t-test. We omit standard deviations since they are all no more than 2 × 10 -4 . 4.2.1 Overall Performance. From Table 1, we find that Rec4Ad significantly performs better than all baselines. Specifically, it outperforms Base in terms of AUC by 0.0027 and outperforms the state-of-the-art IV by 0.0015. This demonstrates the effectiveness of our proposed framework in handling SSB. By dissecting confounders and user-item interest for enhanced representations, it works well over the inference space. Moreover, Rec4Ad successfully maintains even slightly better model calibration than Base, which also verifies its suitability for ads CTR prediction. We also observe that DAG performs worse than baseline both in AUC and ECE. The reason is ad samples and rec samples present different feature distributions and label distributions. Naive data augmentation actually amplifies the distribution discrepancy between training and inference. The original IPS yields worst AUC, while IPS-C with max-capping achieves higher AUC than Base. We attribute this phenomenon to high variance in estimation of propensity score. We also notice that ECE of IPS and IPS-C are all larger than 10 -3 , which verifies that sample re-weighting could change label distribution and result in calibration issues of ads CTR prediction. Table 2: Comparison among Rec4Ad and three competitive baselines on ad groups with different impression ratios. 4.2.2 Performance on Different Ad Groups. In Section 2.2.2, we show that SSB leads model to perform badly on ads with low impression ratios. To validate whether Rec4Ad mitigates such influence, we compare Rec4Ad and three competitive baselines on specific ad Conference acronym 'XX, June 03-05, 2023, Woodstock, NY Gao, et al. groups. We sort ads in descending IR as defined in Eq. (2), where the top 25% are selected as 𝐺 𝑡𝑜𝑝 representing ads with enough impressions and the bottom 25% are selected as 𝐺 𝑏𝑜𝑡𝑡𝑜𝑚 containing ads that are less represented in the training data. Table 2 shows that Rec4Ad achieves best ranking and calibration performance on both 𝐺 𝑡𝑜𝑝 and 𝐺 𝑏𝑜𝑡𝑡𝑜𝑚 . The improvements over Base are greater on 𝐺 𝑏𝑜𝑡𝑡𝑜𝑚 with AUC increased by nearly 0.003 and ECE reduced by 0.001. Thus we conclude that Rec4Ad succeeds in mitigating SSB and boosts model performance on those long-tail ads. We also observe an interesting seesaw phenomenon about IPS-C, which also greatly improves metrics on 𝐺 𝑏𝑜𝑡𝑡𝑜𝑚 but yields worse performance on 𝐺 𝑡𝑜𝑝 compared with Base. It is because IPSC explicitly imposes higher weights for samples with low-IR ads and lower weights for those with high-IR ads. By contrast, Rec4Ad exhibits its superiority that improvements on 𝐺 𝑏𝑜𝑡𝑡𝑜𝑚 are achieved without the cost of degraded performance on 𝐺 𝑡𝑜𝑝 . Figure 6: Comparison among Rec4Ad and its variants. Rec4Ad Rec4Ad w/o SABN wlo SABN wlo Decorrelation wlo Decorrelation 0.681 w/o Alignment : 0.679 Variants Variants 4.2.3 Ablation Study. We analyze the effect of key components in Rec4Ad by comparing it with variants which remove SABN, the alignment module, and the decorrelation module, respectively. Fig. 6 shows that after removing SABN, model calibration experiences an obvious degeneration. The reason is that representations of Rec and Ad samples are with different distributions, making it difficult to normalize them with shared BN parameters and leading to mis-scaled network activations as well as badly-calibrated predictions. Furthermore, we find that AUC even drops under 0 . 679 after removing the alignment module, validating that the alignment regularization is critical for co-training with ad and rec samples. It allows Rec4Ad to extract shared user-item interest behind user clicks and eliminate system-specific confounders from this part. The decorrelation module is also shown effective since the variant without this component performs worse than the default version. It is because splitting non-causal correlations alone in enhanced representations also potentially contributes to accurate predictions [26, 33]. 4.2.4 Study on Disentangled Representations. As x 𝑖𝑛𝑣 and x 𝑐𝑜𝑛 are expected to capture system-invariant and system-specific factors respectively, we aim to investigate their distributions over ad and rec samples. We randomly sample a hybrid batch and visualize learned representations using t-SNE [27]. As shown in Fig. 7, there is no significant difference between x 𝑖𝑛𝑣 for ad and rec samples, suggesting the captured invariance. When it comes to x 𝑐𝑜𝑛 , we observe that ad samples and rec samples are mostly separated in Figure 7: T-SNE visualization of x 𝑖𝑛𝑣 (Left) and x 𝑐𝑜𝑛 (Right) for ad samples (red) and rec samples (blue). 60 40 20 0 20 40 60 60 40 20 0 20 40 60 60 40 20 0 20 40 60 40 20 0 20 40 60 Figure 8: Training AUC of the adversary sample classifier 𝐻 . 0 2500 5000 7500 10000 12500 15000 17500 Training Steps 0.500 0.525 0.550 0.575 0.600 0.625 0.650 Adversary AUC different areas, indicating that this representation extracts systemspecific factors from the training data, which we believe stems from the difference in their selection mechanisms. In the alignment module, we employs an adversary sample discriminator 𝐻 to distinguish x 𝑎𝑑 𝑖𝑛𝑣 and x 𝑟𝑒𝑐 𝑖𝑛𝑣 . Thus the classification performance can be used as an effective proxy to quantitatively evaluate the goodness of x 𝑖𝑛𝑣 . Fig. 8 illustrates the adversary AUC during training. We observe that it increases at the early stage due to optimization of 𝐻 . Then AUC gradually decreases as the training goes on, indicating Rec4Ad tries to generate representations that confuse 𝐻 . Near the end of training, AUC converges to 0.5, which means ad and rec samples are indistinguishable on x 𝑖𝑛𝑣 .",

  "5 CONCLUSION": "In this paper, we propose a novel framework which leverages Rec ommendation samples to help mitigate sample selection bias F or Ad s CTR prediction ( Rec4Ad ). Recommendation samples are first retrieved and mapped to pseudo samples. Ad samples and pseudo samples are jointly considered in learning disentangled representations that dissect system-specific confounders brought by selection mechanisms and system-invariant user-item interest. Alignment and decorrelation modules are included in above architecture. When deployed in Taobao display advertising system, Rec4Ad achieves substantial gains in key business metrics, with a lift of up to +6.6% CTR and +2.9% RPM.",
