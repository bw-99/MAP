One such relation, between the atomic hydrogen (Hi) mass of central galaxies (\ud835\udc40 HI,c ) and the total mass of their host halos (\ud835\udc40 halo ), has attracted significant interest in the last few years. In this work, we use the extended GALEX Arecibo SDSS Survey to examine the scatter of the Hi-halo mass relation for a representative sample of central galaxies. Our findings reveal a flat median relation at log 10 (\ud835\udc40 HI,c /M \u2299 ) \u2248 9.40, across 11.1 < log 10 (\ud835\udc40 halo /M \u2299 ) < 14.1. This flat relation stems from the statistical dominance of star-forming, disc galaxies at low \ud835\udc40 halo in combination with the increasing prevalence of passive, high stellar-concentration systems at higher \ud835\udc40 halo . The scatter of this relation and the stellar specific angular momentum of centrals have a strong link (Spearman's rank correlation coefficient \u2265 0.5). Comparisons with simulations suggest that the kinematic state of host halos may be primarily driving this scatter. Our findings highlight that the Hi-halo mass parameter space is too complex to be completely represented by simple median or average relations and we show that tensions with previous works are most likely due to selection biases. We recommend that future observational studies, and their comparisons with theoretical models, bin central galaxies also by their secondary properties to enable a statistically robust understanding of the processes regulating the cold gas content within central galaxies of dark-matter halos.", "sections": [{"heading": "INTRODUCTION", "text": "Studies that link the baryonic content of galaxies to the gravitational field in and around them, are important to further the understanding of the nature of dark matter and the processes that govern galaxy formation and evolution. Cold gas plays a critical role in the process of star formation and, thus, is a probe for processes regulating galaxy evolution. However, the relationship between cold gas and the gravitational potential of its host halo has not been completely understood. In the last few years, the atomic hydrogen (Hi) to halo mass relation has received increasing attention, in particular from the theoretical community, as it can help constrain simulations of galaxy formation (e.g. Kim et al. 2017;Padmanabhan & Kulkarni 2017;Villaescusa-Navarro et al. 2018;Baugh et al. 2019;Spinelli et al. 2020;Chauhan et al. 2020). Currently, different simulations predict different values of Hi mass (\ud835\udc40 HI ) for a given host halo mass (\ud835\udc40 halo ), particularly in the 11.5 < log 10 (\ud835\udc40 halo /M \u2299 ) < 13.5 range. These disagreements arise due to different input physical models such as that of gas dynamics, stellar feedback, ram-pressure effects, photo-ionisation and interstellar medium properties.\n\u2605 E-mail: manasvee.saraf@icrar.org Simulations also predict a large scatter of the Hi-halo mass relation (Villaescusa-Navarro et al. 2018;Baugh et al. 2019;Spinelli et al. 2020;Chauhan et al. 2020). These simulation-based studies have tested several physical drivers of this scatter such as that related to halo assembly history (e.g. spin, substructure, concentration, formation age) and the efficiency of suppressing gas cooling and enhancing gas outflow by the active galactic nucleus (AGN; e.g. black hole-tostellar mass ratio of the central galaxy). However, like the shape of this relation, the scatter too is found to be model dependent. Testing these predictions with observations is challenging due to limitations of current observational data. It is still very difficult to detect cold gas in galaxies below the star-forming main-sequence (SFMS), given the current sensitivity of radio telescopes (Saintonge & Catinella 2022). To combat this bias and enhance the number statistics, several observational studies improve the signal-to-noise of the Hi 21 cm profile by co-adding spectra of optically selected galaxies or groups (e.g. Guo et al. 2020;Rhee et al. 2023;Dev et al. 2023). These 'spectral stacking' techniques provide direct measurements, extracted from fixed spatial apertures and line widths, of the average Hi content in galaxies or groups within selected \ud835\udc40 halo bins. However, while insightful in studying the underlying average trend between \ud835\udc40 HI and \ud835\udc40 halo , these techniques do not provide any information regarding the scatter.\nIn simulation-based studies, the scatter of the Hi-halo mass relation is especially large when considering only the Hi mass within centrals (\ud835\udc40 HI,c ) as opposed to that within the entire halo (for example, see Fig. 7 and 10 of Chauhan et al. 2020). Characterising this large scatter of centrals with observations could provide important constraints for the physical models input into various galaxy formation simulations. In the past year, a few studies (Dutta et al. 2022;Korsaga et al. 2023;Hutchens et al. 2023) have surfaced that show the observed \ud835\udc40 HI -\ud835\udc40 halo relation to have a very small scatter, at odds with what is found using simulations. This disagreement brings into question whether observation-based results are still biased due to selection effects, or simulation-based studies are using physical models that do not encapsulate the full complexity of baryon physics. To answer these questions, we investigate the scatter of the Hi-halo mass relation of centrals from the extended GALEX Arecibo SDSS survey (xGASS, Catinella et al. 2018). For the first time, we extend previous works into the gas-poor regime, using a sample that provides a fair representation of the range of \ud835\udc40 HI,c that is observed in local central galaxies residing in halos of a wide mass range, 11.1 < log 10 (\ud835\udc40 halo /M \u2299 ) < 14.1.\nThis paper is structured as follows. Section 2 describes the xGASS \ud835\udc40 HI catalogue, two group catalogues using different \ud835\udc40 halo estimation techniques and the studies measuring secondary galaxy properties. The analysis on the shape and scatter of the Hi-halo mass relation of xGASS centrals is presented in section 3, where we also investigate the physical drivers of a central's position in this parameter space. In section 4, we compare our results to those found using previous observation-and simulation-based studies before summarising our study and its key outcomes in section 5. Throughout this study, we assume a \u039b cold dark matter cosmology with \u03a9 M = 0.3, \u03a9 \u039b = 0.7 and the dimensionless Hubble parameter, \u210e = 0.7 related to the Hubble constant, \ud835\udc3b 0 = 70 km s -1 Mpc -1 .", "publication_ref": ["b33", "b53", "b70", "b1", "b63", "b6", "b70", "b1", "b63", "b6", "b56", "b18", "b55", "b11", "b6", "b14", "b36", "b24"], "figure_ref": [], "table_ref": []}, {"heading": "DATA AND METHODOLOGY", "text": "", "publication_ref": [], "figure_ref": [], "table_ref": []}, {"heading": "xGASS", "text": "In this work, we use \ud835\udc40 HI measurements, either detections or upper limits, from xGASS. This survey of 1179 galaxies is selected from the overlap between the Sloan Digital Sky Survey Data Release 7 (SDSS DR7, Abazajian et al. 2009) spectroscopic catalogue and the GALaxy Evolution eXplorer (GALEX, Martin et al. 2005) sky footprint. The selection of these xGASS galaxies is only based on stellar mass, 9 < log 10 (\ud835\udc40 * /M \u2299 ) < 11.5, and redshift, 0.01 < \ud835\udc67 < 0.05. Moreover, the stellar mass (\ud835\udc40 * ) distribution of the observed galaxies is intentionally flat to improve statistics at the high \ud835\udc40 * end (see Fig. 3 of Catinella et al. 2018). The galaxies were observed with Arecibo, a 305m single-dish radio telescope, until Hi was detected or an Hi gasfraction limit of \u223c 2% for galaxies with log 10 (\ud835\udc40 * /M \u2299 ) > 9.7 or a limit of log 10 (\ud835\udc40 HI /M \u2299 ) = 8 for galaxies with log 10 (\ud835\udc40 * /M \u2299 ) \u2264 9.7 was achieved. Thus, xGASS is largely gas-fraction limited and representative of not only Hi-rich but also Hi-poor galaxies. We use this survey as it is the most sensitive and representative Hi survey of the local Universe and, therefore, is ideal to study the positions of individual galaxies on the Hi-halo mass parameter space. The HIsrc flag in the xGASS catalogue is used to distinguish whether a galaxy has an \ud835\udc40 HI detection or an upper limit. For Hi-undetected galaxies, the \ud835\udc40 HI upper limits are estimated by assuming a flat flux of 5 times the spectral noise across a velocity width of 200 km s -1 or 300 km s -1 depending on \ud835\udc40 * (for details see Catinella et al. 2018).", "publication_ref": ["b0", "b44", "b4", "b4"], "figure_ref": ["fig_3"], "table_ref": []}, {"heading": "Group catalogues", "text": "For 1155 of the catalogued galaxies, the xGASS team provides environment metrics from the Yang et al. (2007, hereafter Y07) group 'B' catalogue (for details see Janowiecki et al. 2017). Y07 produced the group catalogue using a halo-based group finder on spectroscopic redshifts, mainly acquired from SDSS DR7. From this Y07 group catalogue, Janowiecki et al. (2017) removed smaller counterparts of a shredded galaxy on the basis of the galaxies' separation from each other. After matching to this shredding-corrected group catalogue, an environment code (env_code_B), the total number of galaxy members in the host group (\ud835\udc41 gal ) and, where available, \ud835\udc40 halo values are provided for each xGASS galaxy. 24 xGASS galaxies do not have matches with the Y07 group catalogue due to their close proximity to either bright stars or survey edges. In Y07, \ud835\udc40 halo values are derived using an abundance-matching technique based on \ud835\udc40 * and only provided for massive halos with log 10 (\ud835\udc40 halo /M \u2299 ) \u2265 11.5. For 343 xGASS centrals in less massive halos, we estimate \ud835\udc40 halo by using a conditional stellar mass function (CSMF; see model 6 in the Table 3 of Yang et al. 2012), which gives the stellar mass of a central (\ud835\udc40 * ,c ) as a function of its host's \ud835\udc40 halo . We correct this CSMF to the Hubble parameter used by xGASS, \u210e = 0.7, and translate it to fit the 197 group centrals with catalogued \ud835\udc40 * and abundance-matching \ud835\udc40 halo values. We run this CSMF, given by equation 1, as an estimator to find the value of \ud835\udc40 halo that returns the \ud835\udc40 * ,c of a given central. \nThere are various uncertainties involved in the estimation of \ud835\udc40 halo based on the method used by Y07. Thus, to confirm the results of our study we also use dynamical \ud835\udc40 halo estimates from the Saulder et al. (2016, hereafter S16) SDSS Data Release 12 (DR12) group catalogue. S16 produced the group catalogue using a friends-of-friends based group finder that is optimised to account for observational biases in SDSS using mock catalogues from the Millennium simulation (Springel et al. 2005). The dynamical \ud835\udc40 halo is derived for each group depending on \ud835\udc41 gal . For galaxies in groups with \ud835\udc41 gal \u2265 5, \ud835\udc40 halo is derived from a function of the group's total luminosity (\ud835\udc3f tot ), luminosity distance (\ud835\udc37 L ), velocity dispersion (\ud835\udf0e group ), radius (\ud835\udc45 group ) and member galaxies detected in SDSS DR12 (\ud835\udc41 fof ). For smaller groups with 2 \u2264 \ud835\udc41 gal \u2264 4, \ud835\udc40 halo is derived from a function of \ud835\udc3f tot , \ud835\udc37 L , \ud835\udf0e group and \ud835\udc45 group . For isolated galaxies, \ud835\udc40 halo is derived from a function of \ud835\udc3f tot and \ud835\udc37 L alone (see section 3.4.7 of S16, for detailed equations and descriptions). We assign an environment code (rank_Mstar) to all galaxies in the S16 group catalogue by ranking those with the same group ID according to their \ud835\udc40 * value. We define a central as the galaxy with the highest \ud835\udc40 * within a group. Next, we perform a positional cross-match between the xGASS catalogue and the galaxy list of the group catalogue (Table A.7. of S16). Since both xGASS and the S16 group catalogue use right ascension and declination values from SDSS, we set a small 3 arcsec match radius. We acquire 1160 matched galaxies and find that the 19 unmatched galaxies are in close proximity to bright stars or survey edges. To recover the \ud835\udc40 halo and \ud835\udc41 gal group properties, we match the group IDs between the group list and the galaxy list of the group catalogue (Table A.2. and A.7. of S16,respectively).

SFR is calculated by combining near-ultraviolet (NUV) magnitudes from GALEX and 22 \ud835\udf07m and/or 12 \ud835\udf07m mid-infrared (MIR) magnitudes measured from the Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE, Wright et al. 2010) images. Where NUV or MIR fluxes are not available, SFR is estimated using spectral energy distribution fits from Wang et al. (2011) (for details see Janowiecki et al. 2017). We calculate \u0394MS (deviations from the SFMS) to acquire a quantification of the star-formation activity that is independent of \ud835\udc40 * . For the subset of xGASS galaxies with catalogued SFR values, \u0394MS is estimated by calculating specific SFR and using the xGASS SFMS fit (equation 2 of Catinella et al. 2018).

It is clear that our sample is dominated by Hi-detected, isolated galaxies where log 10 (\ud835\udc40 halo /M \u2299 ) < 12.5(12.3) and Hi-undetected, group centrals where log 10 (\ud835\udc40 halo /M \u2299 ) \u2265 12.7(12.9) in Fig. 1a (Fig. 1b). We note that the sample in Fig. 1a, as opposed to that in Fig. 1b, has a higher fraction of isolated galaxies, i.e. 70% and 56% respectively.\nTo estimate the median Hi-halo mass relation and quantify the variance of its scatter, we bin our sample of centrals by the \ud835\udc40 halo values of their host halos, and calculate the median \ud835\udc40 HI,c for each bin. Throughout this paper, we use fixed bin widths of 0.2 dex. However, if the counts are < 10, we set a wider bin width to ensure good statistics. For each \ud835\udc40 halo bin, Table 2 lists the \ud835\udc40 halo limits, galaxy counts (\ud835\udc41) and the median \ud835\udc40 HI,c value. We prefer to use medians (rather than averages) because these are not affected by the nondetections, as long as the median value itself is a detection. Table 2 also provides the scatter, quantified as the 16th-84th percentile of the \ud835\udc40 HI,c distribution in that bin. The uncertainties of the median \ud835\udc40 HI,c values are determined via bootstrapping, generating 100,000 random samples for each bin of halo mass. Note, that if the median \ud835\udc40 HI,c value is consistent Hi-undetected centrals, we show it as an upper limit. Similarly, to highlight the parameter space that is unconstrained by our data, the percentile values are only shown if the percentile is consistent with Hi-detected centrals. Median Hi-halo mass relations are modelled by fitting a third order polynomial to the mid \ud835\udc40 halo and median \ud835\udc40 HI,c values of each bin.

The first row of Fig. 2 shows that, at a fixed \ud835\udc40 halo , higher \ud835\udc40 HI,c corresponds to higher \u0394MS and vice versa. This means that, not surprisingly, the scatter of the Hi-halo mass relation varies with \u0394MS. This is quantitatively shown in the right panel, where a \ud835\udf0c S = 0.53 indicates a significant correlation between \u0394\ud835\udc40 HI and \u0394MS.\nInterestingly, in Fig. 2b, we see a secondary dependence of the scatter on \ud835\udc40 halo , where \u0394\ud835\udc40 HI values are higher for centrals in host halos of higher \ud835\udc40 halo and vice versa. This is because starforming centrals have a significant positive Hi-halo mass correlation (\ud835\udf0c S = 0.54) and, while they dominate at the low \ud835\udc40 halo end (log 10 (\ud835\udc40 halo /M \u2299 ) < 12.7), their importance in driving the median trend decreases with increasing \ud835\udc40 halo . In other words, star-forming centrals move away from the flat median Hi-halo mass relation as \ud835\udc40 halo increases. Conversely, the passive centrals represent the typical galaxy (\u0394\ud835\udc40 HI = 0) at the higher \ud835\udc40 halo end, but lie significantly below the median at lower \ud835\udc40 halo values. This suggests that different populations drive the Hi-halo mass relation at different \ud835\udc40 halo , indi-cating that just computing medians might be reductive and not very informative, as in the case of the SFR-\ud835\udc40 * relation. We expand on this point in section 4.\nWhile a high correlation between \u0394MS and \u0394\ud835\udc40 HI is found, this cannot be interpreted as SFR driving the Hi mass in centrals.

In this subsection, we look at one such proxy of structure: light-concentration in the \ud835\udc5f band.\nThe second row of Fig. 2 shows that the scatter follows similar trends with \ud835\udc36 \ud835\udc56 as it does with \u0394MS, but with a weaker correlation, \ud835\udf0c S = -0.32. At a fixed \ud835\udc40 halo , the disc-dominated centrals tend to be more Hi-rich than the high stellar-concentration centrals. The secondary dependence on \ud835\udc40 halo is also seen here, with high stellar-concentration centrals lying below the relation at low \ud835\udc40 halo values, but on the relation in the highest \ud835\udc40 halo bin. If we focus only on the disc-dominated centrals, \ud835\udc40 HI,c and \ud835\udc40 halo show a moderate correlation (\ud835\udf0c S = 0.46).\nWe repeat this analysis with the bulge-to-total ratios (\ud835\udc35/\ud835\udc47) presented in Cook et al. (2019) for xGASS galaxies. However, we find that the majority of Hi-detected centrals are pure discs and assigned \ud835\udc35/\ud835\udc47 = 0 and those centrals with \ud835\udc35/\ud835\udc47 > 0 are dominated by \ud835\udc40 HI,c upper limits. This low dynamic range of \ud835\udc35/\ud835\udc47 for pure-discs in combination with observational limitations towards bulge-dominated systems makes it difficult to study the scatter's dependence on \ud835\udc35/\ud835\udc47. In comparison, \ud835\udc36 \ud835\udc56 has a higher dynamic range for pure-discs, depending on the compactness of their stellar component, being an estimate of the steepness of their light profiles. However, \ud835\udc36 \ud835\udc56 is not robust against all biases (e.g. edge-on spirals can be mistaken for early-type systems, see Strateva et al. 2001;Masters et al. 2010) and only has a weak correlation with \u0394\ud835\udc40 HI .", "publication_ref": ["b32", "b34", "b8", "b66", "b45"], "figure_ref": ["fig_2"], "table_ref": []}, {"heading": "Stellar specific angular momentum", "text": "In this subsection, we explore the kinematic state of the subset of 427 xGASS centrals with values of \ud835\udc57 * available. Overall, the trends are the same as those found with \u0394MS and \ud835\udc36 \ud835\udc56 , but the correlations appear somewhat stronger, as shown in the bottom row of Fig. 2. \ud835\udc57 * and \u0394\ud835\udc40 HI have a high correlation coefficient, \ud835\udf0c S = 0.55, and the secondary dependence on \ud835\udc40 halo appears more clearly defined: i.e. \ud835\udc40 HI,c of the \ud835\udc57 * sub-sample increases with \ud835\udc40 halo , gradually deviating further from the flat median Hi-halo mass relation.\nIt is important to note that we focus on \ud835\udc57 * in this study, even though \u0394\ud835\udc40 HI shows a significantly higher correlation with baryonic specific angular momentum ( \ud835\udc57 b ; provided by Hardwick et al. 2022b). The way Hardwick et al. (2022b) estimated \ud835\udc57 b , makes it strongly correlated with \ud835\udc40 HI (\ud835\udf0c S = 0.89) by construction, so any correlation may just be indicative of the bias in its estimation method. Conversely, \ud835\udc57 * has no built-in correlation with \ud835\udc40 HI . Thus, \ud835\udc57 * is a more reliable avenue to investigate the role of specific angular momentum in driving the scatter of the Hi-halo mass relation. Lastly, before concluding that specific angular momentum may be the primary driver of the scatter of the Hi-halo mass relation, we note that the analysis based on \ud835\udc57 * only uses a sub-sample of the all the xGASS centrals, limited to Hi-detected galaxies of \ud835\udc56 > 30 \u2022 . Therefore, we must re-check the correlation of the scatter with the three galaxy properties tested in this section, using the same subsample of centrals (i.e. those catalogued with both \u0394MS and \ud835\udc57 * values). Doing so, we find the correlation of \u0394\ud835\udc40 HI is \ud835\udf0c S = 0.55(0.50) with \ud835\udc57 * , \ud835\udf0c S = 0.25(0.21) with \u0394MS and insignificant (\ud835\udf0c S = -0.12) with \ud835\udc36 \ud835\udc56 , for the selected sub-sample of centrals matched to the Y07 (S16) group catalogue. Thus, we conclude that the scatter of the Hi-halo mass relation shows the strongest correlation with specific angular momentum.", "publication_ref": [], "figure_ref": ["fig_2"], "table_ref": []}, {"heading": "DISCUSSION", "text": "", "publication_ref": [], "figure_ref": [], "table_ref": []}, {"heading": "The median Hi-halo mass relation", "text": "The median Hi-halo mass relation of xGASS centrals is flat at log 10 (\ud835\udc40 HI,c /M \u2299 ) \u2248 9.40. For log 10 (\ud835\udc40 halo /M \u2299 ) < 12.7, the median is a rotation-supported, star-forming and disc-dominated central, which tends to be Hi-detected and isolated. At higher \ud835\udc40 halo values, the median is a low angular momentum, passive and high stellarconcentration central, which tends to be Hi-undetected and lies in groups (\ud835\udc41 gal > 1). Therefore, at the low \ud835\udc40 halo end, the Hi-rich centrals are dominant and drive the medians up whereas, at the high \ud835\udc40 halo end, the Hi-poor centrals are dominant and drive the medians down (to the detection limit). This switch in dominance of centrals of different properties leads to the flat median Hi-halo mass relation when median \ud835\udc40 HI,c values are calculated across the entire sample of xGASS centrals, without binning by their secondary properties (see Fig. 3 for visual aid). This dependence of a scaling relation's slope on the underlying galaxy bi-modality is also seen in the Hi gas fraction-\ud835\udc40 * relation, where the slope arises because two different galaxy populations dominate at the two \ud835\udc40 * ends (Brown et al. 2015).\nA flat median relation is an incomplete representation of the distribution of centrals in the Hi-halo mass parameter space. The starforming xGASS centrals, which tend to be rotation-supported, discdominated and isolated, showcase a high and positive correlation (\ud835\udf0c S > 0.5) between \ud835\udc40 HI,c and \ud835\udc40 halo , indicative of an increasing Hi-halo mass relation (shown in Fig. 4). These centrals also showcase a positive trend between \u0394\ud835\udc40 HI and \ud835\udc40 halo , i.e. as their host halo mass increases they move further away from the flat median relation. This is reminiscent of the distribution of galaxies on the SFR-\ud835\udc40 * parameter space (e.g. Brinchmann et al. 2004;Elbaz et al. 2007;Noeske et al. 2007;Salim et al. 2007;Peng et al. 2010), where there are multiple galaxy populations and, if we fit a median trend across all galaxies, we would not be able to isolate the SFMS from the passive population (e.g. Saintonge et al. 2017;Catinella et al. 2018;Janowiecki et al. 2020).\nIn a recent study, Korsaga et al. (2023) looked at the Hi masses of 150 isolated galaxies with extended discs and \ud835\udc56 > 30 \u2022 from the Spitzer Photometry and Accurate Rotation Curves (SPARC; Lelli et al. 2016) survey and Local Irregulars That Trace Luminosity Extremes, The Hi Nearby Galaxy Survey (LITTLE THiNGS; Hunter et al. 2012) and measured their host halo masses between 9.4 < log 10 (\ud835\udc40 halo /M \u2299 ) < 12.5 from rotation curves. For galaxies spanning 4 orders of magnitude in \ud835\udc40 * , they found an increasing Hihalo mass relation and a universal Hi-halo mass ratio, indicative of possible mass-independent self-regulation mechanisms. In another recent study, Dutta et al. (2022) studied Hi-detected galaxies from the SPARC sample and 40% of the Arecibo Legacy Fast Arecibo L-band Feed Array (ALFALFA; Haynes et al. 2011) survey area. Dutta et al. (2022) treated all galaxies as isolated and estimated their host halo masses, between 9.4 < log 10 (\ud835\udc40 halo /M \u2299 ) < 12.9, by abundance-matching the Hi mass function with an Hi-selected halo mass function. Doing so, they too recovered an increasing Hi-halo mass scaling relation with the functional form of a double power-law.\nIn Fig. 4 (Fig. A2), we compare the median Hi-halo mass relation of xGASS centrals matched to the Y07 (S16) group catalogue with the scaling relations presented in Dutta et al. (2022) and Korsaga et al. (2023). In comparison to the xGASS medians, both scaling relations have on average 0.6-0.7 dex higher \ud835\udc40 HI,c values. If we restrict the xGASS sample to star-forming galaxies, we recover a similar positive slope but with a negative offset of 0.3-0.5 dex from these published scaling relations. This is not surprising given that both Dutta et al. (2022) and Korsaga et al. (2023) used samples that are more biased towards Hi-rich galaxies than xGASS. Thus, our results, while confirming that \ud835\udc40 HI,c monotonically increases with \ud835\udc40 halo for star-forming centrals, highlight that it is challenging to accurately quantify the shape of the Hi-halo mass relation using only Hi-selected samples.

(2020) and Rhee et al. (2023). Guo et al. (2020) used the Lim et al. (2017) group catalogue to stack ALFALFA centrals, and measured the average \ud835\udc40 HI,c values within a fixed aperture of diameter 200 kpc and velocity width 600 km s -1 centred on the central. Rhee et al. (2023) used the Galaxy And Mass Assembly (GAMA) group catalogue (Driver et al. 2022) to stack centrals in the Deep Investigation of Neutral Gas Origins (DINGO, Meyer 2009) survey, and measured the average \ud835\udc40 HI,c values within a 49 kpc square aperture and 300 km s -1 velocity width centred on the central.\nHere, we work with linear averages instead of medians to make fair comparisons between the xGASS data and the stacked relations. Given that averages are more affected by non-detections than medians, we present two extremes for our average relation, estimated by setting non-detections to either 0 or their upper limit. We shade between these lowest and highest averages and define this shaded area as the average Hi-halo mass relation of xGASS centrals. As is evident, the Hi-undetected centrals have a limited impact on our average relation.\nThe Hi-halo mass relation of centrals from Guo et al. ( 2020) agrees reasonably well with the xGASS averages, with an offset within 0.3 dex towards systematically lower \ud835\udc40 HI,c . The Hi-halo mass relation of centrals from Rhee et al. (2023) is significantly flatter than the xGASS averages. The averages of Rhee et al. (2023) have a positive offset for log 10 (\ud835\udc40 halo /M \u2299 ) < 12 because they only stack group centrals (\ud835\udc41 gal \u2265 2) that, in this \ud835\udc40 halo range, showcase flatter averages in both our sample and that of Guo et al. (2020). The averages of Rhee et al. (2023) have a negative offset for 12 < log 10 (\ud835\udc40 halo /M \u2299 ) < 13.5 because their sample does not include the Hi-rich isolated galaxies and, in this \ud835\udc40 halo range, is more greatly dominated by the Hi-poor red centrals in comparison to the xGASS sample. Curiously, the relation from Rhee et al. (2023) is in line with our median relation for log 10 (\ud835\udc40 halo /M \u2299 ) > 11.5, however, we consider this to be just a  coincidence given that it is meaningless to compare stacking results with median trends.

Of all these secondary properties, \u0394\ud835\udc40 HI most strongly correlates (\ud835\udf0c S \u2265 0.5) with specific angular momentum. This strong correlation is consistent with the dependence between \ud835\udc40 HI and specific angular momentum seen in baryonic Fall relations (e.g. Murugeshan et al. 2020;Mancera Pi\u00f1a et al. 2021a,b;Hardwick et al. 2022b) and suggests that, at fixed \ud835\udc40 halo , the kinematic state of a central may be key in driving the amount of atomic gas available for star formation. This is also confirmed by the positive correlation we recover between \ud835\udc40 HI,c and \ud835\udc40 halo of rotation-supported and/or star-forming centrals. Given the positive Hi-halo mass correlation of rotation-supported isolated galaxies and the potentially large scatter driven by passive group centrals, it is tempting to speculate that the scatter of the Hi-halo mass relation is driven by the host halo formation history. This would be in line with the results from previous works that use (semi-)analytical models (e.g. Guo et al. 2017;Chauhan et al. 2020). As such, it is interesting to see how our results compare with predictions from cosmological simulations. Baugh et al. (2019), Spinelli et al. (2020) and Chauhan et al. ( 2020) modelled the median Hi-halo mass relation of centrals using different semi-analytical models (SAMs) of galaxy formation: GALFORM (Lacey et al. 2016), GAlaxy Evolution and Assembly (GAEA, De Lucia et al. 2014;Hirschmann et al. 2016;Xie et al. 2017;Zoldan et al. 2017) and SHARK (Lagos et al. 2018) respectively. In Fig. 6 (Fig. A4), we compare the medians of xGASS centrals matched to the Y07 (S16) group catalogue with the median relations from the three different SAMs. Although the 16th-84th percentile scatter of GALFORM and SHARK centrals is not published, from comparing the medians it appears that GALFORM and SHARK predominantly produce centrals that are populated with less Hi than that observed with xGASS between 11.4 < log 10 (\ud835\udc40 halo /M \u2299 ) < 12.7 and 11.9 < log 10 (\ud835\udc40 halo /M \u2299 ) < 12.7 respectively. This is most likely due to a prescription of the AGN feedback that removes too much gas in large halos. On the other hand, GAEA is more in line with the xGASS results, with consistent scatter and a systematic offset of \u223c 0.4 dex towards higher median \ud835\udc40 HI,c (see Fig. B1 in Spinelli et al. 2020, for details of the 16th-84th percentile scatter of GAEA centrals). This demonstrates the potential of xGASS to provide tighter constraints to models, with particular emphasis on AGN feedback prescriptions.\nIt is important to acknowledge that some of the differences between xGASS and the predictions of theoretical models may also stem from the differences in the definition of central galaxies, combined with the challenge associated with accurately measuring halo masses from observations. Our use of two independent group catalogues offers some insights into these observational uncertainties (see Fig. 6 and Fig. A4). Moreover, Chauhan et al. (2021) show how the variations in the definition of centrals may impact the exact quantification of \ud835\udc40 HI,c at fixed \ud835\udc40 halo . However, it is extremely unlikely that the substantial differences between the results from xGASS and predictions from GALFORM/SHARK can be solely attributed to the disparity in the definition of centrals. Of course, the situation is different if a simulation estimates \ud835\udc40 HI,c by taking into account the Hi associated with the entire central sub-halo, as done for example in Villaescusa-Navarro et al. (2018) with IllustrisTNG, a cosmological magneto-hydro-dynamical simulation. In that case, a comparison with xGASS is completely meaningless and indeed the IllustrisTNG relation (not shown) is systematically offset towards higher Hi masses.\nBesides studying the shape of the Hi-halo mass relation of centrals, Chauhan et al. (2020) also investigated the physical properties driving its scatter. They find a significant scatter, which is linked to the halo spin parameter (\ud835\udf06) for log 10 (\ud835\udc40 halo /M \u2299 ) < 11.5. In their 'transition region', 11.5 < log 10 (\ud835\udc40 halo /M \u2299 ) < 12.5, the scatter depends on both \ud835\udf06 and the black hole-to-stellar mass ratio of the central galaxy (\ud835\udc40 BH,c /\ud835\udc40 * ,\ud835\udc50 ): i.e. centrals in host halos of high \ud835\udf06 and with low \ud835\udc40 BH,c /\ud835\udc40 * ,\ud835\udc50 are Hi-rich and centrals in host halos of low \ud835\udf06 and with high \ud835\udc40 BH,c /\ud835\udc40 * ,\ud835\udc50 are Hi-poor (for details see Fig. 10 and 11 of Chauhan et al. 2020). Finally, for log 10 (\ud835\udc40 halo /M \u2299 ) > 12.5, the high \ud835\udc40 BH,c /\ud835\udc40 * ,\ud835\udc50 washes out the effect of \ud835\udf06. Overall, they find that centrals in host halos of high \ud835\udf06 have an increasing Hi-halo mass relation where log 10 (\ud835\udc40 halo /M \u2299 ) < 12.5. While \ud835\udf06 and the specific angular momentum of a central can be very different in reality, SHARK assumes that the dark matter and gas follow the same specific angular momentum and that the central and halo have aligned specific angular momenta. Therefore, in low mass halos, where the main contribution of Hi is from the centrals, Chauhan et al. (2020) found the relation between \ud835\udc40 HI and \ud835\udf06 to be a reflection of that between \ud835\udc40 HI and the central's specific angular momentum. Despite the mismatch in median relations, these findings from Chauhan et al. ( 2020) are qualitatively consistent with our results that, for centrals, the scatter of the Hi-halo mass relation has a strong correlation with specific angular momentum and that, for rotation-supported centrals, the \ud835\udc40 HI,c increases with \ud835\udc40 halo . However, our study cannot test if the correlation with specific angular momentum washes out at high \ud835\udc40 halo due to high \ud835\udc40 BH,c /\ud835\udc40 * ,\ud835\udc50 , since we do not have measurements of \ud835\udc57 * for Hi-undetected centrals, which dominate at the high \ud835\udc40 halo end.", "publication_ref": ["b48", "b17", "b6", "b1", "b63", "b37", "b22", "b74", "b77", "b38", "b63", "b7", "b70", "b6", "b6", "b6"], "figure_ref": ["fig_6", "fig_10", "fig_1", "fig_6", "fig_10", "fig_1"], "table_ref": []}, {"heading": "CONCLUSIONS", "text": "We use the xGASS \ud835\udc40 HI catalogue and the Y07 group catalogue to study the scatter of the Hi-halo mass relation of 764 centrals.

We find that this flat Hi-halo mass relation arises from the combination of two different population of centrals dominating statistics at the opposite ends of the \ud835\udc40 halo distribution. Our medians are fully constrained by the data up to log 10 (\ud835\udc40 halo /M \u2299 ) < 12.7, after which \ud835\udc40 HI,c upper limits dominate the median relation. Our results do not change significantly when, instead of the abundancematching estimates from Y07, we use dynamical \ud835\udc40 halo estimates from S16 to conduct the same analysis. This confirms that our study is robust against disagreements between different \ud835\udc40 halo estimation methods.\nWe investigate the drivers of the scatter of the Hi-halo mass relation by studying secondary galaxy and halo properties. We find a correlation of the scatter with the \u0394MS, \ud835\udc36 \ud835\udc56 , \ud835\udc57 * properties of the centrals. The scatter most strongly correlates with \u0394MS and \ud835\udc57 * , with a high correlation coefficient, \ud835\udf0c S \u2265 0.5, between them and \u0394\ud835\udc40 HI . Altogether, the typical galaxy represented by our flat median Hi-halo mass relation becomes more passive, centrally concentrated in stellar structure and dispersion-supported as \ud835\udc40 halo increases. These flat medians fail to showcase that the star-forming, disc-dominated and rotation-supported isolated galaxies in host halos of high masses tend to be Hi-rich. This is reminiscent of the distribution of galaxies on the SFR-\ud835\udc40 * plane, suggesting that simple median or average relations may not be a complete representation of all centrals in the Hi-halo mass parameter space, especially at the high \ud835\udc40 halo end.\nWhen making comparisons with previous observation-based studies that use spectral stacking techniques, we find consistent results as the average Hi-halo mass relations found by Guo et al. (2020), but we see a small tension with the result of Rhee et al. (2023), who found a flatter average relation. To further understand the true scatter while taking advantage of the improved number statistics enabled by the spectral stacking studies, we advise that centrals are also binned by their secondary properties (related to their kinematic state) before their spectra are co-added.\nWhen comparing xGASS with cosmological simulations, we find that GALFORM and SHARK semi-analytical models predict extremely Hi-poor centrals in host halos above log 10 (\ud835\udc40 halo /M \u2299 ) \u223c 12.3. We speculate that this is primarily an issue with the AGN feedback prescription in these models. Conversely, among the models tested in this paper, GAEA shows the least tension with our results, with a relatively mild systematic offset towards higher \ud835\udc40 HI,c values (\u223c 0.4 dex) across the entire range of \ud835\udc40 halo values investigated here.\nWe note that our study is limited at the high \ud835\udc40 halo end, log 10 (\ud835\udc40 halo /M \u2299 ) \u2265 12.7, where Hi-undetected centrals start dominating. Our study can be improved with follow-up surveys or targeted searches, conducted with the new and state-of-the-art radio telescopes such as the Five hundred meter Aperture Spherical Telescope (Nan et al. 2011) and the Square Kilometre Array (Dewdney et al. 2009) and its precursors (Johnston et al. 2008;Jonas 2009;Koribalski et al. 2020;Rhee et al. 2023). Observations from such surveys would not only have better resolution, enabling studies that use rotation curves to empirically measure \ud835\udc40 halo (e.g. Korsaga et al. 2023) and galaxy kinematics (e.g. Fall & Romanowsky 2018;Mancera Pi\u00f1a et al. 2021a), but also better sensitivity, improving the number statistics. Targeted Hi searches may also be able to provide \ud835\udc40 HI,c detections or upper limits of centrals in very high mass halos, i.e. log 10 (\ud835\udc40 halo /M \u2299 ) > 13.5, where our study has only one wide \ud835\udc40 halo bin and beyond which only a handful of observations exist (e.g. Mc-Namara et al. 1990;Jaffe 1990;Taylor 1996;Taylor et al. 1999;V\u00e9ron-Cetty et al. 2000;Struve et al. 2010;Saraf et al. 2023).
