However, watch time is not only influenced by the matching of users' interests but also by other factors, such as duration bias and noisy watching . Duration bias refers to the tendency for users to spend more time on videos with longer durations, regardless of their actual interest level. Noisy watching, on the other hand, describes users taking time to determine whether they like a video or not, which can result in users spending time watching videos they do not like. Consequently, the existence of duration bias and noisy watching make watch time an inadequate label for indicating user interest. Furthermore, current methods primarily address duration bias and ignore the impact of noisy watching, which may limit their effectiveness in uncovering user interest from watch time. In this study, we first analyze the generation mechanism of users' watch time from a unified causal viewpoint. Specifically, we considered the watch time as a mixture of the user's actual interest level, the duration-biased watch time, and the noisy watch time. To mitigate both the duration bias and noisy watching, we propose D ebiased and D enoised watch time Co rrection (D 2 Co), which can be divided into two steps: First, we employ a duration-wise Gaussian Mixture Model plus frequencyweighted moving average for estimating the bias and noise terms; then we utilize a sensitivity-controlled correction function to separate the user interest from the watch time, which is robust to the estimation error of bias and noise terms. The experiments on two public video recommendation datasets and online A/B testing indicate the effectiveness of the proposed method. \u2217 Jun Xu is the corresponding author.

In order to better satisfy the information needs of users and improve their engagement, an accurate and personalized video recommendation plays a significant role. Unlike the traditional recommendation scenario, the video recommendation adopts a streaming play pattern [9, 11]. That is, a recommender system switches to the next video and plays it automatically when the user finishes playing the previous one. This feature makes the widely used implicit feedback (e.g., user click) no longer suitable as a label to measure user interest. Compared to clicks, users' watch time indicates how much attention the user is willing to spend on this video and has been considered a better indicator of user interest [7, 24, 32, 33]. However, the length of watch time is not only determined by user interest alone but also affected by other non-interest factors. On the one hand, users tend to spend more time watching engaging videos with longer durations, resulting in longer average watch time for long videos. This phenomenon is referred to as duration bias [35, 39]. As shown in Fig. 1(a), all three videos \ud835\udc63 1 , \ud835\udc63 2 , \ud835\udc63 3 are of interest to users but have different durations. It can be seen that users have a longer watch time for engaging videos with longer duration (e.g., \ud835\udc63 3 ). If we regard watch time as the indicator of user interest, the duration bias will mislead the recommendation models leans to recommend more long videos. On the other hand, users need time to perceive whether they like newly recommended videos. As a result, they may watch videos they are not interested in for a while, commonly RecSys '23, September 18-22, 2023, Singapore, Singapore Haiyuan Zhao et al.

We calculate the mean watch time for videos that are/aren't interesting to users in different duration. referred to as noisy watching [14]. Fundamentally, noisy watching results from the users' trust in the recommender system itself [1] or the clickbait content at the beginning of videos [26]. As shown in Fig. 1(b), users tend to believe that the newly recommended videos engage them when the video starts playing. Consequently, they may begin watching this video and take some time (e.g., 10s) to realize they are not interested in it. The presence of noisy watching results in users spending time watching videos they do not like, which can also mislead the recommendation models if we regard watch time as the indicator of user interest. To verify the existence of the aforementioned duration bias and noisy watching, we conducted a pilot study on the KuaiRand dataset [9], a large-scale public video recommendation dataset collected from Kuaishou. For detecting the duration bias, we first aim to find records in the dataset that are engaging to users. Although we do not know users' latent interest behind each record, there is still some behavior feedback [38] in the dataset. Specifically, we treat one record as of interest to the user if one of the positive behavior feedback in like , follow , forward , comment , profile enter is presented. Then, we calculate the mean watch time in different duration on this subset. As shown in Fig. 2(a), the mean watch time of engaging videos increases with the duration growth, which verified the existence of duration bias. Similarly, for detecting noisy watching, we first regard records with negative behavior feedback like hate as not engaging to the user. Then, we calculate the mean watch time on this subset. As shown in Fig. 2(b), the mean watch time of videos that users aren't interested in is not zero, verifying the existence of noisy watching. Meanwhile, we can find that the curve in Fig. 2(b) increases as the duration grows. This is because longer videos usually have richer video content or a more prolonged beginning, which makes users spend more time perceiving their level of interest. Despite the hazards, duration bias and noisy watching are much less explored as compared to many other biases in recommender system research. One heuristic way to address duration bias is to divide the watch time by the video duration, called Play Complete Rate (PCR). However, it is worth noting that the trend between watch time and duration is not a simple linear relationship according to Fig. 2. Therefore, simply dividing by duration cannot eliminate the duration bias. To better address duration bias, Zhan et al. [35] proposed to transform normal watch time prediction into duration-grouped watch time quantile to mitigate the negative effects of duration bias. Zheng et al. [39] proposed standardizing the watch time according to different video duration and leveraging the standardized score as the supervision signal to train and evaluate the video recommendation model. Although effective, there still has much space for improvement: (i) current studies only focus on addressing the duration bias while overlooking the noisy watching, which makes their predicted user interest signals still inaccurate; (ii) Existing approaches (e.g., [35] and [39]) rely on underlying assumptions (we will discuss this in section 3.3) about the distribution of user interests for correcting the duration bias. Once these assumptions are violated in practice, their performances cannot be guaranteed. To jointly model both duration bias and noisy watching, we first conduct a causal analysis of the generation mechanism of users' watch time. Unlike current methods, which only notice the duration bias in watch time, we considered the watch time as a mixture of the user's actual interest level, the duration-biased watch time, and the noisy watch time. Then we propose a model called D ebiased and D enoised watch time Co rrection (D 2 Co) to mitigate the duration bias and noisy watching. Specifically, we propose to regard the distribution of watch time in each duration length as a mixture of latent bias and noise distributions. A duration-wise Gaussian mixture model is employed to estimate the parameters of these latent distributions. Since the adjacent value of duration should have similar properties, a frequency-weighted moving average is used to smooth the estimated bias and noise parameters sequence. Then we utilized a sensitivity-controlled correction function to separate the user interest from the watch time, which is robust to the estimation error of bias and noise parameters. Compared to existing methods, D 2 Co enjoys the advantages of correcting the duration bias and noisy watching simultaneously in video recommendation and does not require critical assumptions on the distributions of the user interest. The major contributions of the paper include the following: (1) We analyze the existence of duration bias and noisy watching in the video recommendation and provide a unified causal view for modeling the bias and noise simultaneously.

D 2 Co can obtain user interest from watch time and does not rely on the critical assumption of user interest distribution. (3) We conducted offline experiments on two public video recommendation datasets and an online A/B test on the real video product. Experimental results verified the effectiveness of the proposed model and theoretical conclusions.", "2 RELATED WORKS": "Video Recommendation With the rapid growth of video content, personalized recommendation is widely used to provide videos of interest to users in video applications. The key challenge for video recommendation is to mine user interest from various signals [23]. In a classic recommendation scenario, Click-Through-Rate (CTR) is an effective metric for measuring user interest [6, 12, 19, 22]. However, since the video recommendation scenario adopts a streaming play pattern, clicks are no longer a reliable indicator of user interest. Instead, users' watch time is commonly used as a substitute indicator of user engagement [7, 24, 32, 33]. For instance, Covington et al. [7] treated the watch time as a weight of each impressed video and utilized a weighted logistic regression for predicting watch time. Wu et al. [32] investigated the bias of watch time as well as watch percentage from an aggregated level and defined relative engagement to measure the video quality. Moreover, other trials utilized multiple user behaviors to enhance video recommendation. For example, Zhao et al. [38] proposed a large-scale multi-objective ranking system for recommending what video to watch next on an industrial video-sharing platform. Li et al. [15] designed a graphbased sequential network to simultaneously model users' dynamic and diverse interests. Wei et al. [30] considered the interactions between users and items and the item contents from various modalities. Debiasing in Information Retrieval Alleviating the bias is of great importance in current information retrieval systems. Most efforts are devoted to address the position bias [2, 13, 34], popularity bias [29, 37, 40] and selection bias [20, 21, 27] in recent studies. Inspired by causal inference [31], a large number of debiasing methods are proposed for mitigating aforementioned biases, which includes propensity-based methods [13, 36], backdoor adjustment methods [29, 37] and causal embedding methods [4, 5, 40]. As we discussed before, the bias in video recommendation is mainly duration bias. However, only a few studies [35, 39] are focused on this bias in video recommendation. In contrast to our approach, existing methods for addressing duration bias rely on critical assumptions to achieve their unbiasedness. Denoising in Information Retrieval To denoise data for improving model performance has been an emerging research topic in recent years. In general, the noised data is defined as the falsepositive and false-negative samples among the dataset. The core idea of current studies is to mine noise data based on Memorization Effect [3]. That is, models can easily remember clean samples but have difficulty remembering noisy samples. For instance, Wang et al. [25] tried to mine noisy samples from the loss value and designed an adaptive threshold mechanism for truncating these samples of high loss values. Wang et al. [28] proposed to discover noisy samples from the disagreement of different models. Gao et al. [10] proposed a self-guided learning framework to collect memorized interactions at the early stage of the training. However, the above studies aim to develop a generic approach without specifically analyzing the noise in the video recommendation scenario.", "3 PROBLEM STATEMENTS": "", "3.1 Problem Formulization": "The problem of video recommendation can be described as follows. Given a user \ud835\udc62 and a recalled video \ud835\udc63 with duration \ud835\udc51 , each uservideo pair ( \ud835\udc62, \ud835\udc63 ) is described by an \ud835\udc5b -dimensional feature vector x = \ud835\udf19 ( \ud835\udc62, \ud835\udc63 ) \u2208 R \ud835\udc5b . The interest of \ud835\udc62 in \ud835\udc63 can be represented by an unobserved variable \ud835\udc45 . Without loss of generality, we assume that \ud835\udc45 \u2208 { 0 , 1 } is a binary variable, which is sampled from latent Bernoulli distribution Pr ( \ud835\udc45 = 1 | x ) . The users' watching behavior on videos can be recorded as the log data D = {( x \ud835\udc56 , \ud835\udc64 \ud835\udc56 , \ud835\udc51 \ud835\udc56 )} \ud835\udc41 \ud835\udc56 = 1 , where x \ud835\udc56 , \ud835\udc64 \ud835\udc56 , \ud835\udc51 \ud835\udc56 respectively denote the \ud835\udc56 -th user-video pair's feature vector, user's watch time on this video, and the duration of this video (e.g., in seconds) Ideally, a scoring function \ud835\udc53 ( x ) : R \ud835\udc5b \u2192 R could be learned by minimizing the following ideal point-wise loss:  where \ud835\udc5f is the unobserved user's true interest in a video, \ud835\udf0e is the sigmoid function. Equation (1) cannot be minimized because the interest indicator \ud835\udc5f is unobserved. An alternative way is naively fitting the prediction to the observed watch time \ud835\udc64 in D :  where \ud835\udc64 max is the maximum watch time in the whole D . Note that since the value of watch time \ud835\udc64 is not between 0 and 1, it is scaled into the interval [ 0 , 1 ] by simply dividing with \ud835\udc64 max . As has been discussed, there exists a gap between the optimal solution of L naive and that of L ideal because the watch time \ud835\udc64 suffers from both duration bias and noisy watching. The goal of this paper is to mitigate the bias and noise, i.e., uncovering the user interest from watch time for learning better scoring function \ud835\udc53 ( x ) .", "3.2 Causal Analysis of Watch Time": "Next, we analyze how the duration bias and noisy watching affect the watch time based on the causal graph [18] shown in Figure 3. Given a user-video pair ( \ud835\udc62, \ud835\udc63 ) , its feature vector x decides both duration \ud835\udc37 and user interest \ud835\udc45 . This is reasonable because the video duration is part of the endogenous features of this video, and the level of user interest in this video can be considered as the matching extent between the user feature and the video feature. Then duration \ud835\udc37 and user interest \ud835\udc45 decide the watch time \ud835\udc4a together, as we discussed before. Since the user interest \ud835\udc45 is an unobserved variable in the dataset, watch time \ud835\udc4a is leveraged as a surrogate label of \ud835\udc45 . Unfortunately, besides the relevance \ud835\udc45 , \ud835\udc4a is also affected by the video duration \ud835\udc37 , which leads to duration bias RecSys '23, September 18-22, 2023, Singapore, Singapore Haiyuan Zhao et al. Figure 3: Causal graph of users' watch time in video recommendation. The gray node denotes the unobserved variable R. The red arrow denotes the effect that the recommendation model needs to estimate. D X W R X - Feature of (u,v) D - Duration W - Watch time R - User interest and noisy watching. Therefore, directly fitting watch time \ud835\udc4a will result in an erroneous video recommendation model. According to this causal graph, we can formulate the expected watch time for a given user-video pair as follows:  The first equation is the definition of expectation; the second equation is the decomposition of Pr ( \ud835\udc4a = \ud835\udc64 | x ) based on the Figure 3; the third equation is based on the fact that one video only has a unique duration and the fourth equation is the multiplication switching law. Finally, we decomposed E ( \ud835\udc4a | x ) into the mixture of E ( \ud835\udc4a | \ud835\udc51, \ud835\udc45 = 1 ) and E ( \ud835\udc4a | \ud835\udc51, \ud835\udc45 = 0 ) , which is weighted by Pr ( \ud835\udc45 = 1 | x ) and Pr ( \ud835\udc45 = 0 | x ) , respectively. Specifically, the E ( \ud835\udc4a | \ud835\udc51, \ud835\udc45 = 1 ) represents the average time users will watch a video of duration \ud835\udc51 due to their interest, which indicates the length of duration-biased watch time. Meanwhile, the E ( \ud835\udc4a | \ud835\udc51, \ud835\udc45 = 0 ) represents the average time users will watch a video of duration \ud835\udc51 they are not interested in, which indicates the length of noisy watch time. Pr ( \ud835\udc45 = 1 | x ) indicates the user's interest level for a video. For the ease of notation, we denote E ( \ud835\udc4a | x ) as \ud835\udc64 , E ( \ud835\udc4a | \ud835\udc51, \ud835\udc45 = 1 ) as \ud835\udc64 + \ud835\udc51 , E ( \ud835\udc4a | \ud835\udc51, \ud835\udc45 = 0 ) as \ud835\udc64 -\ud835\udc51 and Pr ( \ud835\udc45 = 1 | x ) as \ud835\udc5d \ud835\udc5f x in future formulation. Then we have:  Eq. (4) provides a unified formulation of duration bias and noisy watching rather than treating them as two separate mechanisms, which is beneficial for developing a unified method for addressing them simultaneously. Based on decomposition on Eq. (4), we next give the error analysis of watch time as follows: Theorem 1 (Error of watch time). for a given ( \ud835\udc62, \ud835\udc63 ) , the error between scaled watch time \ud835\udc64 \ud835\udc64 max and its unobserved interest probability \ud835\udc5d \ud835\udc5f x is:  The proof of the Theorem is apparent based on Eq. (4). As illustrated in Theorem 1, the upper bound of watch time's error can be divided as the linear combination of the error caused by duration bias and the error caused by noisy watching. The total error of watch time can be further reduced when both two errors are reduced. This error analysis proved the need to develop an approach to address both duration bias and noisy watching.", "3.3 Analysis of Existing Methods": "Methods have been proposed to address the issue brought by the duration bias, including Play Complete Rate, Watch Time Gain [39] and Duration-Deconfounded Quantile-based Method [35]. However, the noisy watching is usually overlooked in these methods. Moreover, these methods uncover users' true interests with some critical assumptions on the user interest distribution, which are not always true in the real world, as shown in the following sections. 3.3.1 Play Complete Rate. In fact, the problem brought by duration bias is the different magnitude of different duration levels. In order to mitigate the effect of the magnitude, one direct idea is to scale each watch time \ud835\udc64 with its corresponding video duration \ud835\udc51 and employ this ratio as a surrogate label of user interest, which is called Play Complete Rate (PCR). For a given ( \ud835\udc62, \ud835\udc63 ) , its PCR is formulated as:  Compared with naively adopting watch time as the indicator of user interest, PCR takes a step towards scaling the magnitude according to each duration group and achieves better results. However, it can be shown that PCR can uncover user interest from watch time if and only if \ud835\udc64 + \ud835\udc51 = \ud835\udc36 1 \ud835\udc51 and \ud835\udc64 -\ud835\udc51 = \ud835\udc36 2 \ud835\udc51 , where \ud835\udc36 1 and \ud835\udc36 2 are two constants. The detailed analysis can be found in Appendix A.1 In practice, the underlying assumptions of PCR can hardly be satisfied. As shown in Fig 2, the curve of \ud835\udc64 + \ud835\udc51 and \ud835\udc64 -\ud835\udc51 with duration \ud835\udc51 is not a linear function. As a consequence, the performance of PCR cannot be guaranteed. 3.3.2 Watch Time Gain. Watch time gain (WTG) [39] is a newly proposed state-of-the-art method for eliminating the duration bias. The core idea of WTG is to conduct standardization after video duration grouping, thus scaling the magnitude of watch time in each duration into the same interval. For a given ( \ud835\udc62, \ud835\udc63 ) , its WTG is formulated as:  where \ud835\udf07 \ud835\udc64 ( \ud835\udc51 ) is the average watch time and \ud835\udf0e \ud835\udc64 ( \ud835\udc51 ) is the standard deviation of watch time for the videos with duration \ud835\udc51 . Different from PCR, which only considers the watch time magnitude of the Uncovering User Interest from Biased and Noised Watch Time in Video Recommendation RecSys '23, September 18-22, 2023, Singapore, Singapore current sample, WTG is a method that aims to get a relative score among each duration group, thus further reducing the influence of duration bias. However, it can be shown that WTG can uncover user interest from watch time if and only if the distribution of user interest at each duration has the same expectation and standard deviation. The detailed analysis can be found in Appendix A.2. In fact, it is unreasonable to assume that every duration group has a consistent user interest distribution. As illustrated in Fig 3, both user interest \ud835\udc45 and video duration \ud835\udc37 are determined by the feature of ( \ud835\udc62, \ud835\udc63 ) . Therefore, the distribution of \ud835\udc45 and the distribution of \ud835\udc37 are still correlated, which violates the assumption of WTG. 3.3.3 Duration-Deconfounded Quantile-based Method. DurationDeconfounded Quantile-based Method (D2Q) [35] is another stateof-the-art method for alleviating duration bias. Unlike WTG, D2Q transforms the original watch time into the quantile score in each equal-frequency duration bin. For a given ( \ud835\udc62, \ud835\udc63 ) , its D2Q label is formulated as:  where |D| is the total number of samples in the whole dataset, \ud835\udc40 is the number of equal-frequency duration bins, \ud835\udf0b \ud835\udc5a ( \ud835\udc64 ) : R \u2192 { 1 , 2 , \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , | D| \ud835\udc40 } is a descending ranking function of watch time for current bin \ud835\udc5a . Similar to WTG, D2Q is also a kind of method for obtaining relative scores among each bin group. However, it can be shown that D2Q can uncover user interest from watch time if and only if all bins have the same ranking function of user interest. See the analysis in Appendix A.3 for the details. In order to hold the condition, it is necessary to reduce the number of bins, which in turn reduces the performance of debiasing. Moreover, the assumption is difficult to be tested in most cases.", "4 OUR APPROACH: D 2 CO": "To jointly mitigate the duration bias and noisy watching and relax the above assumptions, we propose Debiased and Denoised watch time Correction (D 2 Co). Specifically, we first employ a durationwise Gaussian Mixture Model plus frequency-weighted moving average for estimating the bias and noise terms. Then, we utilize a sensitivity-controlled correction function to separate user interest from watch time, which can reduce the sensitivity to estimation error.", "4.1 Estimating the Bias and Noise Terms": "As illustrated in Eq. (4), the expected watch time \ud835\udc64 of a given ( \ud835\udc62, \ud835\udc63 ) can be decomposed as the mixture of duration-biased watch time \ud835\udc64 + \ud835\udc51 and noisy watch time \ud835\udc64 -\ud835\udc51 . From the perspective of probability, the distribution of watch time Pr ( \ud835\udc4a = \ud835\udc64 | x ) for a given ( \ud835\udc62, \ud835\udc63 ) can also be considered as the mixture of two latent distributions: Pr ( \ud835\udc4a = \ud835\udc64 | \ud835\udc51, \ud835\udc45 = 1 ) and Pr ( \ud835\udc4a = \ud835\udc64 | \ud835\udc51, \ud835\udc45 = 0 ) , which is formulated as follows:  where Pr ( \ud835\udc4a = \ud835\udc64 | \ud835\udc51, \ud835\udc45 = 1 ) is the distribution of the watch time due to the user's interest in videos with duration \ud835\udc51 , which suffers duration bias; Pr ( \ud835\udc4a = \ud835\udc64 | \ud835\udc51, \ud835\udc45 = 0 ) is the distribution of the watch time that user watches videos with duration \ud835\udc51 they are not interested in, which is controlled by noisy watching. The weight of each component is the user interest probability Pr ( \ud835\udc45 = 1 | x ) and Pr ( \ud835\udc45 = 0 | x ) . To uncover user interest from the watch time, we need to estimate the parameters of the latent distributions. Here, we assume that Pr ( \ud835\udc4a = \ud835\udc64 | \ud835\udc51, \ud835\udc45 = 1 ) and Pr ( \ud835\udc4a = \ud835\udc64 | \ud835\udc51, \ud835\udc45 = 0 ) are two latent Gaussian distributions, which is a wild assumption. Then the Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) can be utilized for estimating the parameters of latent mixture Gaussian distribution. However, Eq. (8) lies on the individual level, which means we don't have enough samples to estimate the parameters of GMM for each individual. To this end, we transform the individual-level GMM equivalently to the duration level:  Here, \u02dd x \u2208X \ud835\udc51 Pr ( x ) Pr ( \ud835\udc45 | x ) can be regarded as the average user interest in videos of duration \ud835\udc51 . We can find that the latent distributions Pr ( \ud835\udc4a = \ud835\udc64 | \ud835\udc51, \ud835\udc45 = 1 ) and Pr ( \ud835\udc4a = \ud835\udc64 | \ud835\udc51, \ud835\udc45 = 0 ) are still the same as Eq. (8). As a result, we can estimate GMM parameters at the duration-level. To verify the rationality of the adoption of durationlevel GMM, we show statistics on the distribution of watch time on the KuaiRand dataset. Fig. 4(a) shows the watch time distribution of different duration groups(e.g., \ud835\udc37\ud835\udc62\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc5b = 20 \ud835\udc60, 30 \ud835\udc60, 40 \ud835\udc60, 50 \ud835\udc60 ). A significant bimodal phenomenon appears on those hist diagrams. However, as shown in Fig. 4(b), this bimodal phenomenon disappears if we go to the watch time distribution of duration range (e.g., \ud835\udc37\ud835\udc62\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc5b < 50 \ud835\udc60 ). This supports the rationality of regarding the watch time distribution as a mixture distribution in the durationlevel. Furthermore, considering that adjacent duration should have similar duration-biased watch time and noisy watch time, we employ a bi-directional frequency-weighted moving average to smooth the estimated sequence of duration-biased watch time \u02c6 \ud835\udc64 + \ud835\udc51 and noisy watch time \u02c6 \ud835\udc64 -\ud835\udc51 . That is:  where \ud835\udc47 denotes the window size of moving average. The smoothed e \ud835\udc64 + \ud835\udc51 and e \ud835\udc64 -\ud835\udc51 are leveraged to separate user interest from watch time in the next section.", "4.2 Separating User Interest from Watch Time": "Based on Eq. (4), we can obtain the user interest with the bias term e \ud835\udc64 + \ud835\udc51 and noise term e \ud835\udc64 -\ud835\udc51 via affine correction, which named as RecSys '23, September 18-22, 2023, Singapore, Singapore Haiyuan Zhao et al.

Given ( \ud835\udc62, \ud835\udc63 ) , \ud835\udc5f D 2 Co ( A ) x is unbiased if the bias and noise terms are accurately estimated:  On the basis of Eq. (4), the proof of this theorem is apparent. However, we can hardly accurately estimate the bias and noise term in practice. Once the estimation error occurs, then the above theorem will not hold. To this end, we analyzed the parameter sensitivity of \ud835\udc5f D 2 Co ( A ) x towards e \ud835\udc64 + \ud835\udc51 and e \ud835\udc64 -\ud835\udc51 respectively, which is given by the following theorem: Theorem 3 (Parameter Sensitivity).

The proof of Theorem 3 is based on the definition of parameter sensitivity. This theorem indicates that the estimation error of bias and noise terms has different effects at different watch time. For S \ud835\udc64 + \ud835\udc51 , it has large value with the growth of \ud835\udc64 . In contrast, S \ud835\udc64 -\ud835\udc51 has lower value with the growth of \ud835\udc64 . From the perspective of the entire dataset, the dataset with the majority of short watch time is mainly affected by \ud835\udc64 -\ud835\udc51 . In contrast, the dataset with the majority of long watch time is mainly affected by \ud835\udc64 + \ud835\udc51 . To this end, we proposed a sensitivity-controlled correction function that adjusts sensitivity preferences according to the proportion of watch time in the dataset:  \ud835\udc47 , sensitivity control term  2 for \ud835\udc51 \u2208 { \ud835\udc51 min , \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , \ud835\udc51 max } do 3 D \u2032 = {( x \ud835\udc56 , \ud835\udc64 \ud835\udc56 , \ud835\udc51 \ud835\udc56 ) | ( x \ud835\udc56 , \ud835\udc64 \ud835\udc56 , \ud835\udc51 \ud835\udc56 ) \u2208 D \u2227 ( \ud835\udc51 \ud835\udc56 = \ud835\udc51 )} ; 4 W + [ \ud835\udc51 ] , W - [ \ud835\udc51 ]\u2190 GMM (D \u2032 , components = 2 ) ; 5 end 6 e W + \u2190 Moving_Average ( W + , \ud835\udc47 ) (Eq.(10)); 7 e W - \u2190 Moving_Average ( W -, \ud835\udc47 ) (Eq.(10)) ; 8 for ( x \ud835\udc56 , \ud835\udc64 \ud835\udc56 , \ud835\udc51 \ud835\udc56 ) \u2208 D do R[ D 2 Co S 9 \ud835\udc56 ]\u2190 ( 10 end 11 return R where \ud835\udefc is the sensitivity control term. We can prove that, \ud835\udc5f D 2 Co ( S ) x has a lower sensitivity to parameters \ud835\udc64 + \ud835\udc51 and \ud835\udc64 -\ud835\udc51 compared to \ud835\udc5f D 2 Co ( A ) x through the following proposition. Proposition 1 (D 2 Co(S) has lower sensitivity). For a given ( \ud835\udc62, \ud835\udc63 ) , denoting the sensitivity of D 2 Co(S) as S \u2032 \ud835\udc64 + \ud835\udc51 and S \u2032 \ud835\udc64 -\ud835\udc51 , we have:  Due to the limitation of the page, proof Proposition 1 can be found in supplementary material. In practice, we need to tune the value of \ud835\udefc for controlling the sensitivity of D 2 Co(S) towards \ud835\udc64 + \ud835\udc51 and \ud835\udc64 -\ud835\udc51 . The pipeline of our method is shown in Algorithm 1. In summary, we employ a duration-wise Gaussian Mixture Model and a frequency-weighted moving average to estimate the bias and noise terms. Then, we utilize a sensitivity-controlled correction function instead of a standard affine correction to better separate user interest from watch time. The separated user interest can be utilized as the supervision signal for learning a better recommendation model. \ud835\udc5f ( ) x \ud835\udc64 W + [ ] W - [ ] \ud835\udc56 , e \ud835\udc51 \ud835\udc56 , e \ud835\udc51 \ud835\udc56 , \ud835\udefc ) (Eq.

For evaluating the performance of proposed D 2 Co, we utilize two public real-world datasets: WeChat 1 and KuaiRand 2 . They are respectively collected from two large micro-video platforms, Wechat Channels and Kuaishou. We list their statistic information in Table 1. The details of these two datasets are as follows: WeChat . This dataset is released by WeChat Big Data Challenge 2021, containing the Wechat Channels logs within two weeks. Following the practice in [39], we split the data into the first 10 days, the middle 2 days, and the last 2 days as training, validation, and test set. The adopted input features include userid , feedid , device , authorid , bgm_song_id , bgm_singer_id , user_type , like , read_comment , forward . KuaiRand [9]. KuaiRand is a newly released sequential recommendation dataset collected from KuaiShou. As suggested in [9], we utilized one of the subsets KuaiRand-pure in this study. To mitigate the sparsity problem, we selected data from which the video duration is up to 4 minutes. We split the data into the first 14 days, the middle 7 days, and the last 10 days as training, validation, and test set. The adopted input features include user_id , video_id , author_id , music_id , video_type , upload_type , tab , is_like , is_follow , is_comment , is_forward , is_profile_enter , is_hate , most_popular_tag . 5.1.2 Evaluation. As we discussed before, the watch time is an unreliable label for measuring user interest. For evaluating the performance of mitigating the duration bias and noisy watching in watch time, we need to know the true user interest in the recommended video. Since the explicit feedbacks suffer the spareness problem, we cannot directly utilize them as ground truth labels in our experiments. To this end, we adopt the definition of long_view from the KuaiRand dataset [9] as the user interest indicator, which defines the user interest for a given ( \ud835\udc62, \ud835\udc63 ) as follows:  It is worth noting that this kind of definition is close to Valid Viewing (VV), which is one of the online metrics we leveraged in online A/B testing (section 5.6). Unlike the RMSE used in [35] and WTG used in [39], we are mainly concerned about whether the recommendation model can rank interesting videos in top-ranking positions, so the GAUC and nDCG@k are utilized as the evaluation metric of recommendation performance. 5.1.3 Baselines. As have been described in Section 4.2, D 2 Co has two versions D 2 Co(A) and D 2 Co(S) . In our experiments, we will compare our proposed method with these baselines: PCR , D2Q [35] and WTG [39]. To investigate the generalization of our method and baselines, we integrate them with different backbone models. 1 https://algo.weixin.qq.com/ 2 http://kuairand.com/ Specifically, we use the classical linear recommendation model FM [19], the classical deep recommendation model DeepFM [12] and the state-of-the-art recommendation model AutoInt [22] as our backbone recommendation model. Moreover, considering that the existing baselines overlook the noisy watching, we equip those baselines with denoise capability via data post-processing. Specifically, we treat all samples with less than 5 seconds of watch time as 0 values after calculating the value of baseline labels. This simple post-processing divides the noise samples by threshold so that the baselines have denoise capability, and they are denoted as PCR-denoise , D2Q-denoise , and WTG-denoise . 5.1.4 Implementation Details. We implement all the backbones with pytorch-fm 3 , an open-source library for factorization machine models. We employ Binary Cross Entropy Loss for all baselines and our methods for fair comparisons. In particular, we transform WTG into probability via the cumulative density function \u03a6 (\u00b7) of standard Gaussian distribution. For D 2 Co(A) and D 2 Co(S), we clip their value into the interval [ 0 , 1 ] . For D2Q, the group number is set to 60 in KuaiRand and 30 in WeChat. We utilize Adam as the optimizer and set the initial learning rate as 0.001. The batch size is set as 512. For all the backbone models, we set their latent embedding dimension to 10. For all methods with neural networks, the hidden units are set to 64 while the dropout ratio is set to 0.2. The value of moving average window size \ud835\udc47 is tuned in the interval [ 1 , 5 ] , and the value of sensitivity control term \ud835\udefc is tuned in the interval [ 1 \ud835\udc52 -2 , 5 \ud835\udc52 -2 ] in WeChat dataset and [-1 \ud835\udc52 -2 , -5 \ud835\udc52 -2 ] in KuaiRand dataset. We tune our hyper parameters on the validation set while evaluating the performance on the test set. The source code is available at https://github.com/hyz20/D2Co.git.", "5.2 Overall Performance": "Table 2 illustrates the recommendation performance of proposed D 2 Co and other baselines. According to the result in Table 2, our proposed D 2 Co(S) obtains the best performance on both KuaiRand and WeChat datasets and all backbones significantly. In addition, the recommendation models trained with debiased labels PCR, D2Q, and WTG outperform those trained by Watch Time by a large margin since they mitigate the duration bias. Then, Our proposed D 2 Co(A) and D 2 Co(S) further outperform these debias baselines since our proposed methods consider the noisy watching. Furthermore, our proposed D 2 Co(S) has better performance than D 2 Co(A) in both datasets. This shows the superiority of our sensitivity-controlled correction. In section 5.4, we will reveal the intrinsic reasons why D 2 Co(S) exceeds D 2 Co(A). It is worth noting that those baselines equipped with denoise post-processing (PCR-denoise, D2Q-denoise, WTG-denoise) have different degrees of improvement compared to their original methods. This phenomenon clearly confirms the existence of noisy watching. However, the denoise post-processing is just a heuristic truncation of the short watch time samples, which only removes part of the noise. Hence, there still exist performance gaps between D 2 Co(S) and most denoised baselines. Moreover, the gap between original baselines and Watch Time is larger than that between 3 https://github.com/rixwew/pytorch-fm RecSys '23, September 18-22, 2023, Singapore, Singapore Haiyuan Zhao et al.

D 2 Co(S) and original baselines in KuaiRand dataset. Therefore, we can conclude that duration bias is more harmful than noisy watching in the KuaiRand dataset. In contrast, the gap between original baselines and Watch Time is smaller than that between D 2 Co(S) and original baselines in WeChat dataset, which indicate that noisy watching is the main problem in this dataset. We will further discuss this conclusion in section 5.3. error caused by duration bias is a decreasing curve. This indicates that the duration bias dominates the overall error of watch time in short-duration intervals of WeChat. However, in long-duration intervals of WeChat, the noisy watching dominates the watch time's overall error.", "5.3 The Effectiveness of Mitigating Bias and Noise": "Although Tabel 2 shows a significant improvement of our D 2 Co compared to the baselines, it is still unclear how much of these improvements come from the denoise that we claim to have taken into account. In Theorem 1, we analyzed the error of watch time and divided the overall error into the duration bias-caused error and noisy watching-caused error. On this basis, we first present the curve of mean error with video duration in Fig. 5, with the estimated \ud835\udc64 + \ud835\udc51 and \ud835\udc64 -\ud835\udc51 . In Fig. 5(a), the error caused by duration bias is much larger than that of noisy watching, and the curve of noisy watching is close to zero. This indicates that duration bias dominates the error of watch time in KuiaRand. In Fig. 5(b), the error caused by noisy watching is an increasing curve, while the Then we split both KuaiRand and WeChat into three equal frequency duration ranges and evaluate the performance of each method in the corresponding subset. The results are shown in Table 3. To better reveal the performance difference, we defined the improve percentage \ud835\udc3c\ud835\udc5a\ud835\udc5d ( % ) \ud835\udc5a = \ud835\udc49 \ud835\udc5a -\ud835\udc49 \ud835\udc64\ud835\udc61 \ud835\udc49 \ud835\udc5c -\ud835\udc49 \ud835\udc64\ud835\udc61 in each subset, where \ud835\udc49 \ud835\udc5a is the value of current method's performance, \ud835\udc49 \ud835\udc64\ud835\udc61 is the value of Watch Time's performance and \ud835\udc49 \ud835\udc5c is the value of Oracle's performance. Actually, \ud835\udc3c\ud835\udc5a\ud835\udc5d ( % ) \ud835\udc5a indicates the relative effect of debias and denoise in the current subset. For KuaiRand, although it has only duration bias caused error, our method D 2 Co(A) and D 2 Co(S) still exceeds the baseline, which shows the superiority of our method not relying on the critical assumptions. On WeChat, baselines and D 2 Co(A) have similar performance in short duration while D 2 Co(A) outperform baselines significantly in long duration. Also note that for these debiased baselines, their performances in the long duration of WeChat (e.g., ( 42 , 60]) even showed declines relative to the Watch Time.

For KuaiRand, it has many records of the long watch time. These records make the sensitivity mainly dominated by \ud835\udc64 + \ud835\udc51 . For WeChat, it has many records of short watch time. These records make the sensitivity mainly dominated by \ud835\udc64 -\ud835\udc51 . Similarly, we divide the datasets into equal-frequency groups by duration range. The larger the duration, the longer the average watch time. Fig. 6 we present the GAUC of D 2 Co(A) and D 2 Co(S) in different duration ranges of two datasets. As we discussed, the bottleneck of KuaiRand is those long watch time records, so our proposed D 2 Co(S) mainly outperforms D 2 Co(A) in a large duration range (e.g., (94,240]). Meanwhile, the bottleneck of WeChat is those short watch time records, so our proposed D 2 Co(S) mainly outperforms D 2 Co(A) in a small duration range (e.g., (0,16]). In general, our proposed sensitivity-controlled correction is able to control the parameter sensitivity according to the bottleneck of different datasets, thus enhancing the original D 2 Co(A).", "5.5 The Effect of Hyper-Parameters": "There are two hyper-parameters of our proposed D 2 Co. One is the size of the windows \ud835\udc47 of frequency-weighted moving average in Eq. (10). The larger the \ud835\udc47 , the smoother the bias and noise terms at adjacent times and the less specific the bias and noise terms themselves. The other is the sensitivity control term \ud835\udefc of sensitivitycontrolled correction in Eq (12). The larger the absolute value of \ud835\udefc , the greater the decrease in sensitivity of the corresponding bias and noise parameter, but the smaller the unbiasedness of estimated user interest. In most cases, \ud835\udefc is set to a very small value. Both \ud835\udc47 and \ud835\udefc are essential for improving the performance of D 2 Co. Fig. 7 illustrate the performance change of FM, DeepFM and AutoInt with different values of \ud835\udc47 and \ud835\udefc . The figure indicates that different backbone recommendation models may have different reactions to the change of \ud835\udc47 and \ud835\udefc .

Due to the effect of video duration, the watch time suffers from duration bias and noisy watching simultaneously. Current methods can only address duration bias while overlooking the noisy watching. Moreover, they rely on some critical assumptions to uncover the user interest, which may not hold in practice. To this end, we propose D 2 Co to mitigate both duration bias and noisy watching. Specifically, we first employ a duration-wise Gaussian Mixture Model plus frequency-weighted moving average for estimating the bias and noise terms; then, we utilize a sensitivity-controlled correction function to separate the user interest from the watch time. The experiments on two public video recommendation datasets and online A/B testing indicate the effectiveness of the proposed D 2 Co.
