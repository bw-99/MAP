  "Keywords": "Recently, transformers have demonstrated great potential for modeling long-term dependencies from skeleton sequences and thereby gained ever-increasing attention in skeleton action recognition. However, the existing transformer-based approaches heavily rely on the naive attention mechanism for capturing the spatiotemporal features, which falls short in learning discriminative representations that exhibit similar motion patterns. To address this challenge, we introduce the Freq uency-aware Mix ed Trans former (FreqMixFormer), specifically designed for recognizing similar skeletal actions with subtle discriminative motions. First, we introduce a frequency-aware attention module to unweave skeleton frequency representations by embedding joint features into frequency attention maps, aiming to distinguish the discriminative movements based on their frequency coefficients. Subsequently, we develop a mixed transformer architecture to incorporate spatial features with frequency features to model the comprehensive frequency-spatial patterns. Additionally, a temporal transformer is proposed to extract the global correlations across frames. Extensive experiments show that FreqMiXFormer outperforms SOTA on 3 popular skeleton action recognition datasets, including NTU RGB+D, NTU RGB+D 120, and NW-UCLA datasets.

  "1 Introduction": "Reading Writing Time Frequency-aware Mixed Transformer Fuse High-Frequency Feature Low-Frequency Feature Spatial Feature Frequency-Spatial Feature General Transformer Spatial Feature Previous methods Our methods Drink water Figure 1: The overall design of our Frequency-aware Mixed Transformer. Our FreqMixFormer model overcomes the limitations of traditional transformer-based methods, which cannot effectively recognize confusing actions such as reading and writing due to the straightforward process of skeleton sequences. As highlighted with the colored boxes, the FreqMixFormer introduces the frequency domain and extracts high-frequency features, which often indicate subtle and dynamic movements (red), and low-frequency features, which are associated with slow and steady movements (blue). These features are then fused with spatial features. Our results demonstrate that the integrated frequency-spatial features significantly improve the model's capability to discern discriminative joint correlations. MM'24, October 28-November 1, 2024, Melbourne, VIC, Australia Wenhan Wu et al. Human action recognition, a vital research topic in computer vision, is widely applied in various applications, including visual surveillance [52, 53], human-computer interaction [19, 40], and autonomous driving systems [29, 33]. Particularly, skeleton sequences represent the motion trajectories of human body joints to characterize distinctive human movements with 3D structural pose information, which is robust to surface textures and backgrounds. Consequently, skeletal action recognition stands out as an effective approach for recognizing human actions compared to RGB-based [56, 70] or Depth-based [66, 82] methods. Early skeleton-based works typically represent the human skeleton as a sequence of 3D joint coordinates or a pseudo-image, then adapted Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) [15, 20, 21] or Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) [12, 22, 73] to model spatial features among joints. However, unlike static images, skeleton data embodies dynamic and complex spatiotemporal topological correlations that CNNs and RNNs fail to capture. Therefore, to effectively model the skeletal information encapsulated within the topological graph structure that reflects human anatomy, Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) [8-10, 23, 24, 26, 50, 68, 71] are utilized. Nevertheless, as graph information progresses through deeper layers, the model may lose vital joint correlations and direct propagation, diminishing its ability to capture long-range interactions between distant frames. Recently, Transformer [57] has acquired promising results in human action recognition in various data modalities such as RGB [30, 47], depth [61, 62], point cloud [36, 65], and skeleton [10, 60]. The Transformer's ability to model the intrinsic representation of human joints and sequential frame correlations makes it a suitable backbone for skeleton-based action recognition. Despite the notable achievements of several transformer-based studies [4, 14, 34, 44, 51, 67, 69, 75, 81], they have yet to surpass the accuracy benchmarks set by GCNs. We hypothesize that the primary issue contributing to this gap is - GCNs, through their localized graph convolutions, effectively capture the human spatial configuration essential for action recognition. In contrast, traditional transformers, utilizing global self-attention operations, lack the inductive bias to inherently grasp the skeleton's topology. Although these global operations model overall motion patterns within a skeleton sequence, the self-attention mechanism in transformers may dilute the subtle local interactions among joints. Additionally, as attention scores are normalized across the entire sequence, subtle yet crucial discrimination in action sequences might be ignored if they do not substantially impact the overall attention landscape. To bridge this gap, we focus on improving transformers' capability to learn discriminative representation of subtle motion patterns. In this work, we aim to aggregate the frequency-spatial features by introducing Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) [1] into a mixed attention transformer framework [11, 69] to encode joint correlations in the frequency domain to explore the frequency-based joint representations. The motivation behind the representations is straightforward and intuitive: the frequency components can represent the entire joint sequence [39] and are sensitive to subtle movements. As a result, we introduce a novel Frequency-aware Mixed Transformer (FreqMixFormer) for skeleton action recognition to capture the discriminative correlations among joints. The key steps of our approach are outlined as follows: Firstly , we formulate a Frequency-aware Attention module for transferring spatial joint information to the frequency domain, where the skeletal movement dependencies (similarity score between Queries 𝑄 and Keys 𝐾 ) are embedded in the spectrum domain with a distinct representation based on their energy. As illustrated in Fig.1, discriminative skeleton features with similar patterns (e.g., confusing actions like reading and writing) can be effectively learned by leveraging their physical correlations. In the context of these skeleton sequences, minor movements that contain subtle variations and exhibit rapid spatial changes are effectively compressed into high-frequency components with lower energy (highlighted with the red box). Conversely, actions that constitute a larger portion of the sequence and change slowly over time in the temporal domain are compressed into low-frequency components with higher energy (shown in the blue box). Subsequently, a frequency operator is applied to accentuate the high-frequency coefficients while diminishing the low-frequency coefficients, thereby enabling selective amplification and attenuation for fine-tuning within the frequency domain. Secondly , we propose a transformerbased model that utilizes mixed attention mechanism to extract spatial and frequency features separately with self-attention (SA) and cross-attention (CA) operations, where SA and CA extract joint dependencies and contextual joint correlations respectively. An integration module subsequently fuses the features from both the frequency and spatial domains, resulting in frequency-spatial features. These features are then fed into a temporal transformer, which globally learns the inter-frame joint correlations (e.g., from the first to the last frame), effectively capturing the discriminating frequency-spatial features temporally. Our contributions are summarized as follows: · We propose a Frequency-aware Attention Block (FAB) to investigate frequency features within skeletal sequences. A frequency operator is specifically designed to improve the learning of frequency coefficients, thereby enhancing the ability to capture discriminative correlations among joints. · Consequently, we introduce the Frequency-awareMixedTransformer (FreqMixFormer) to extract frequency-spatial joint correlations. The model incorporates a temporal transformer designed to enhance its ability to capture temporal features across frames. · Our proposed FreqMixFormer outperforms state-of-the-art performance on three benchmarks, including NTU RGB+D [48], NTU RGB+D 120 [35], and Northwestern-UCLA [58].",

  "FrequencyRepresentationLearningforSkeleton-based Tasks.": "Traditional pose-based methods aim to extract motion patterns directly from the poses for trajectory-prediction [28, 54], pose estimation [6, 79], action recognition [10, 71]. The representations derived from pose space naturally reflect physical characteristics (spatial dependency of structure information) and motion patterns (temporal dependency of motion information), making it challenging to encode poses in a spatiotemporal way. Motivated by a strong ability to encode temporal information in the frequency domain smoothly and compactly [3], several recent works [13, 27, 39, 59] utilize discrete cosine transform (DCT) to convert the temporal Frequency Guidance Matters: Skeletal Action Recognition by Frequency-Aware Mixed Transformer MM'24, October 28-November 1, 2024, Melbourne, VIC, Australia motion to frequency domain for frequency-specific representation learning. In skeleton action recognition, only a few works [5, 7, 16, 45] have considered frequency representations so far. [16] proposed a multi-feature branches framework to extract subtle frequency features with fast Fourier transform (FFT) and spatial-temporal joint dependencies, aiming to build a multi-task framework in skeleton action recognition. [7] adopts discrete wavelet transform with a GCN-based decoupling framework to decouple salient and subtle motion features, aiming for fine-grained skeleton action recognition. While our interest aligns with frequency-based modeling, we opt for a DCT-based approach since its frequency coefficients are welldistributed in the frequency domain, benefiting the discriminative motion representation learning. Transformer-based Skeleton Action Recognition. Many recent works adopt transformers for human pose estimation [76, 78] and skeleton action recognition [38, 46] to explore joint correlations via attention mechanism. ST-TR [44] is the first to introduce the transformer to process skeleton data with spatial transformer and temporal transformer, proving its effectiveness in action recognition. Many follow-up works [14, 38, 46, 69, 75] keep employing this spatial-temporal structure for skeleton recognition with different configurations. STTFormer [46] proposed a tuple self-attention mechanism for capturing the joint relationships among frames. FG-STFormer [14] was developed to understand the connections between local joints and contextual global information across spatial and temporal dimensions. SkeMixFormer [69] introduced mixed attention method [11] and channel grouping techniques into spatiotemporal structure, enabling the model to learn the dynamic multivariate topological relationships. Besides these methods that focus on model configurations, [41] designed a partitioning strategy with the self-attention mechanism to learn the semantic representations of the interactive body parts. [34] presented an efficient transformer with a temporal partitioning aggregation strategy and topology-aware spatial correlation modeling module. Most of the transformer-based methods mentioned above mainly focus on configuration improvement and spatiotemporal correlation learning without exploiting the skeletal motion patterns in the frequency domain. In this work, we propose a frequency-based transformer with a frequency-spatial mixed attention mechanism, leveraging joint representation learning.",

  "3.1 Preliminaries": "Transformer. Self-Attention is the core mechanism of the transformer [57]. Given the input 𝑋 ∈ R 𝐶 × 𝐷 , where 𝐶 is the number of patches and 𝐷 is the embedding dimension, 𝑋 is first mapped to three matrices: Query matrix 𝑄 , Key matrix 𝐾 and Value matrix 𝑉 by three linear transformation:  where 𝑊 𝑄 , 𝑊 𝐾 and 𝑊 𝑉 ∈ R 𝐷 × 𝐷 are the learnable weight matrices. The self-attention score can be described as the following mapping function:  where 𝑄𝐾 ⊤ is the similarity score, 1 √ 𝑑 is the scaling factor that prevents the softmax function from entering regions where gradients are too small. Next, the Multi-Head Self-Attention (MHSA) function is introduced to process information from different representation subspaces in different positions. The MHSA score is expressed as:  where 𝐻 𝑖 = 𝐴𝑡𝑡𝑒𝑛𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛 ( 𝑄 𝑖 , 𝐾 𝑖 , 𝑉 𝑖 ) , 𝑖 ∈ { 1 , 2 , . . . , ℎ } is the single attention head, 𝑊 𝑜𝑢𝑡 is a linear projection ∈ R 𝐷 × 𝐷 . Baseline. The existing transformer-based skeleton action recognition methods rely heavily on plain self-attention blocks mentioned above to capture spatiotemporal correlations, ignoring the contextual information among different blocks. Thus, we simply adopt off-the-shelf SkeMixformer [69] as our baseline for capturing spatial skeletal features, where the contextual information can be extracted based on a mixed way: 1) Cross-attention, an asymmetric attention scheme of mixing Query matrix 𝑄 and Key matrix 𝐾 , leveraging asymmetric information integration. 2) Channel grouping, a strategy that divides the input into unit groups to capture multivariate interaction characteristics, preserving the inherent features of the skeleton data by avoiding the full self-attention's dependency on global complete channels. However, SkeMixFormer falls short of modeling discriminative motion patterns, thereby not fully leveraging its representational potential. In light of the baseline's limitations, we introduce our proposed FreqMixFormer to verify the effectiveness of frequencyspatial features over purely spatial ones. The detailed components of our model are elaborated in the following sections.",
  "3.2 Overview of FreqMixFormer": "The overall architecture of FreqMixFormer is illustrated in Fig. 2. Given the input 𝑋 ∈ R 𝐽 × 𝐶 × 𝐹 is embedded by joint and positional embedding layers to represent a skeleton sequence with a consistent frame count of 𝐹 , where 𝐶 denotes the dimensionality of the joint, and 𝐽 represents the number of joints in each frame. Then a partition block is proposed for capturing multivariate interaction association characteristics, where 𝑋 is divided into 𝑛 unit groups ( 𝑛 = 3 in Fig. 2 for example) by channel splitting to facilitate interpretable learning of joint adjacency. The split unit is expressed as 𝑥 𝑖 ∈ R 𝐽 ×( 𝐶 / 𝑛 ) × 𝐹 and 𝑋 ← Concat [ 𝑥 1 , 𝑥 2 , . . . , 𝑥 𝑖 ] , where 𝑖 = 1 , 2 , . . . , 𝑛 . Next, we feed unit inputs 𝑥 𝑖 to the Frequency-aware Mixed Transformer based on self-attention and cross-attention mechanisms among Spatial Attention Blocks and Frequency-aware Attention Blocks. Afterward, frequency-spatial mixed features are processed with a Temporal Attention Block to learn inter-frame correlations. The final outputs are further reshaped and passed to an FC layer for classification. MM'24, October 28-November 1, 2024, Melbourne, VIC, Australia Wenhan Wu et al.

Then 𝑋 is divided into 𝑛 ( 𝑛 = 3 as an example in this figure) unit groups as the input 𝑥 𝑖 . The explanation of data partition is available in Section 3.2. Next, 𝑥 𝑖 passes through the Frequency-aware Mixed Transformer to extract the mixed frequency-spatial attention maps 𝑀𝐹𝑆 𝑖 (the definition is available in Section 3.4 ), which contain the joint fusion patterns from the frequency and spatial domains. These maps are subsequently concatenated into a feature 𝑀 along with the Value 𝑉 as the input of the temporal attention block, leading to an inter-frame joint correlation learning, and the corresponding output 𝑋 𝑜𝑢𝑡 is passed to an FC-layer for the classification.

  "3.3 Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) for Joint Sequence Encoding": "coefficients of the transformation, meaning it is well-distributed for amplifying subtle motion features. Let 𝑥 ∈ R 𝐽 × 𝐶 × 𝐹 denotes the input joint sequence, the trajectory of the 𝑗 -th joint across 𝐹 frames is denoted as 𝑋 𝑗 = ( 𝑥 𝑗, 0 , 𝑥 𝑗, 1 , ..., 𝑥 𝑗,𝐹 ) . While existing transformer-based skeleton action recognition methods only use this 𝑋 𝑗 as an input sequence for skeletal correlation representation learning in the spatial domain, we propose to adopt a frequency representation based on Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT). Different from the previous DCT-based trajectory representation learning methods [26, 39, 77], which discard some of the high-frequency coefficients for providing a more compact representation, we not only keep all the DCT coefficients but also enhance the high-frequency parts and reduce the low-frequency parts. The main motivations behind this are: (i) High-frequency DCT components are more sensitive to those subtle discrepancies that are difficult to discriminate in the spatial domain (e.g., the hand movements in reading and writing, which are illustrated in Fig. 1). (ii) Low-frequency DCT coefficients reflect the movements with steady or static motion patterns, which are not discriminative enough in recognition (e.g., the lower body movements in reading and writing, which are also illustrated in Fig. 1). (iii) The cosine transform exhibits excellent energy compaction properties to concentrate the majority of the energy (low-frequency coefficients) into the first few Thus, we apply DCT to each trajectory individually. For trajectory 𝑋 𝑗 , the 𝑖 -th DCT coefficient is calculated as:  where the Kronecker 𝛿 𝑖 𝑗 = 1 if 𝑖 = 𝑗 , otherwise 𝛿 𝑖 𝑗 = 0. In particular, 𝑖 ∈ { 1 , 2 , . . . , 𝐹 } , the larger 𝑖 , the higher frequency coefficient. These coefficients enable us to represent skeleton motion within the frequency domain effectively. Besides, the original input sequence in the time domain can be restored using Inverse Discrete Cosine Transform (IDCT), which is given by:  where 𝑗 ∈ { 1 , 2 , . . . , 𝐹 } . To use DCT coefficients in the transformer, we further introduce a Frequency-aware Mixed Transformer for extracting mixed frequency-spatial features in the next section.

  "3.4 Frequency-aware Mixed Transformer": "Mixed Spatial Attention. Given a split input 𝑥 𝑖 ∈ R 𝐽 ×( 𝐶 / 𝑛 ) × 𝐹 mentioned in Section 3.2, the basic Query matrix and Key matrix for each sequence are extracted along the spatial dimension:  where 𝑖 = 1 , 2 , . . . , 𝑛 . In Eq. 6, 𝐴𝑣𝑔𝑃𝑜𝑜𝑙 denotes adaptive average pooling for smoothing the joint weight and minimizing the impact of noisy or less relevant variations within the skeletal data, and an FC-layer with a ReLU activation operation is applied to ensure 𝑄 𝑖 and 𝐾 𝑖 are globally integrated. Then, the self-attention is expressed as:  In order to enable richer contextual integration across different unit groups, inspired by [11], a cross-attention strategy is proposed, where 𝐾 𝑖 is shared between adjacent attention blocks. The cross attention is expressed as:  Each mixed attention map is formulated as:  where the number of this association mixed-attention maps is based on the number of unit groups (e.g., 𝑛 = 3 in Fig. 2). These mixedattention maps are extracted by several SABs (Spatial Attention Blocks, illustrated in Fig. 3 (a)) for spatial representation learning. Mixed Frequency-Spatial Attention. We apply DCT to obtain the corresponding frequency coefficients from the split joint sequence 𝑥 𝑖 , and then the inputs to FABs (Frequency-aware Attention Blocks, see in Fig. 3) can be denoted as 𝐷𝐶𝑇 ( 𝑥 𝑖 ) , where 𝐷𝐶𝑇 (·) denotes the transform expressed in Eq. 4. Similar to the mixed spatial attention, we obtain the Query and Key values along the frequency domain:  Thecorresponding frequency-based self-attention and mixed-attention maps are:   Thus, the mixed frequency attention maps are expressed as:  Subsequently, a Frequency Operator (FO) 𝜓 (·) is adopted to mixed frequency attention maps: 𝜓 ( 𝑀𝐹 𝑖 ) . Given a frequency operator coefficient 𝜑 , where 𝜑 ∈ ( 0 , 1 ) , the high-frequency coefficients in 𝑀𝐹 𝑖 are enhanced by ( 1 + 𝜑 ) , making minimal and subtle actions more pronounced. On the other hand, the low-frequency coefficients are reduced by 𝜑 , appropriately diminishing the focus on salient actions while preserving the integrity of overall action representations. The search for the best 𝜑 is discussed in Section 4.5. Afterward, an IDCT module is employed to restore the transformed skeleton sequence: 𝑀𝐹 𝑖 = 𝐼 𝐷𝐶𝑇 ( 𝜓 ( 𝑀𝐹 𝑖 )) . All the 𝑀 𝑖 are extracted by Frequency-aware Attention Blocks (FABs), as depicted in Fig. 3 (b). Thus the output is: 𝑀𝐹𝑆 𝑖 = 𝑀𝐹 𝑖 + 𝑀𝑆 𝑖 , and the final output of the mixed frequency-spatial attention map can be expressed as:  Weobtain Value 𝑉 from the initial input 𝑋 with unified computation via adding one spatial 1 × 1 convolutional layer along the spatial dimension. Consequently, the input of the Temporal Attention Block is expressed as:  Temporal Attention Block. Given the temporal input 𝑥 𝑡 based on the mixed frequency-spatial attention method, some tricky strategies in [69] are adopted to transform the input channel and acquire more multivariate information alone the temporal dimension: 𝑋 𝑡 = 𝐶𝑇 ( 𝑥 𝑡 ) (the channel transformation 𝐶𝑇 (·) is detailed in the Appendix). Then the transformed input 𝑋 𝑡 is processed with a temporal attention block (Fig. 3 (c)) to obtain the corresponding Query and Key matrices:   And the Value in temporal attention block 𝑉 𝑡 is obtained from the temporal input after a 1 × 1 convolutional layer along the temporal dimension.

The data is classified into 60 classes with two benchmarks. 1) Cross-Subject (X-Sub): half of the subjects are set for training, and the rest are used for testing. 2) Cross-View (X-View): training and test sets are split based on different camera views (2, 3 views for training, 1 for testing).

  "4.5 Ablation Study": "In this section, we first evaluate the role of key modules in FreqMixFormer, including FAB, FO, and TAB, to analyze the effectiveness of each block. Then we propose to search for the best variants within the model, including the number of unit group 𝑛 for input partition and the best frequency operator coefficient 𝜑 . Additionally, we provide the visualization of the attention maps to show the effectiveness of the mixed frequency-spatial attention mechanism. The Design of Frequency-aware Mixed Transformer. As the results shown in Table 4, the baseline only contains the basic Spatial MixFormer module from [69], which only achieves 89.8% accurate. Then we propose 3 modules for analysis: 1) Frequency-aware Attention Block (FAB): the key part in our proposed method, extracting frequency-based attention maps from the joint sequence, leading to a 1.2% improvement in our baseline. 2) Frequency Operator (FO): an extra module within FABs enhances the high-frequency coefficients and reduces the low-frequency coefficients based on the DCT operator coefficient, resulting in a 1.4% improvement in the baseline. 3) Temporal Attention Block (TAB): a module utilized to learn joint correlations across frames, leading to a 0.9% over the baseline performance. As we can see, each of these modules can enhance the baseline's performance, where the main contribution comes from the utilization of Frequency-aware Attention Blocks with a proper frequency operator coefficient. The best result comes from the combination of all these modules with baseline, which achieves 91.5% accuracy in NTU-60 X-Sub with joint modality. It is speculated that the proposed frequency-aware attention mechanism (see in Section 3.4) plays a significant role in enhancing the action recognition performance.

However, further increments do not lead to better outcomes, only to a higher computational cost (the model parameters keep increasing from 1.26M to 2.83M).

As 𝜑 increases from 0.1 to 0.5, there is a general trend of improved performance, reaching a peak at 𝜑 = 0 . 5, which achieves the highest accuracy of 91.5% on NTU-60 X-Sub and 96.0% on X-View. However, further increasing 𝜑 from 0.6 to 0.9 does not lead to improvements in performance. In fact, the accuracy slightly declines. This suggests that enhancing high-frequency components too much or reducing low-frequency components too aggressively may lead to loss of motion patterns learning. Effectiveness of the Mixed Frequency-aware Attention. Fig. 4 presents the visualization of the attention matrices learned by FreqMixFormer. The skeleton configuration is generated from the NTU-60 dataset (Fig. 4 (a)). We take \"eat meal\" as an example (Fig. 4 (b)). In the correlation matrix, a more saturated yellow represents a large weight, indicating a stronger correlation among joints. And the numbers denote different joints. Note that the Mixed Spatial Attention Map (Fig. 4 (c), learned by SAB) represents the spatial relationships among joints. The Mixed Frequency Attention Map (Fig. 4 (d), learned by FAB) suggests the frequency aspects of motion. Based on these two attention maps, a mixed frequency-spatial attention map is proposed (Fig. 4 (e)) for capturing both spatial correlations and frequency dependencies, integrating the spatial and frequency skeleton features. MM'24, October 28-November 1, 2024, Melbourne, VIC, Australia Wenhan Wu et al. Table 5: Search for the best number of the unit 𝑛 . Table 6: Search for the best frequency operator coefficient 𝜑 . As we see in the figures, the model focuses on the correlations with the spine and right-hand tip in the spatial domain. As for the frequency domain, more correlation areas are concerned (joint connections with the spine, left arm, and the interactions between head and hands), which indicates the model is analyzing more discriminative movements overlooked in the spatial domain. Meanwhile, the mixed frequency-spatial attention map contains not only the strong attention areas learned from spatial space but also the concerned correlations in frequency space. This demonstrates that our FreqMixFormer model advances this by extracting minimal and subtle joint representations (highlighted with the red box in Fig. 4 (b)) from both spatial and frequency domains. The effectiveness of the mixed frequency attention is also verified in Table 4. Figure 4: The visualization of attention matrices. (a) is the joint index of the NTU RGB+D dataset.

  "4.6 Comparison Results on Confusing Actions": "To validate our model's capability in discerning discriminative actions, similar to [7, 80], we categorize certain actions from the NTU-60 dataset (only joint stream with X-Sub protocol) into three sets based on the classification results of Hyperformer [81]: the actions with accuracy lower than 80% as Hard set, between 80% and 90% as Medium set, and higher than 90% as Easy set. All the confusing actions are classified into Hard and Medium sets. For example, \"writing,\" \"reading,\" and \"playing with a phone\" are categorized as Table 7: The results on different difficult-level actions for NTU RGB+D dataset. Hard action sets due to their subtle differences, which are limited to small upper-body movements involving only a few joint correlations, leading to low recognition results. We compare our results with the recent transformer-based models Hyperformer [81] and SkeMixFormer [69]. The results of different difficult-level actions are displayed in Table 7, showcasing that our model outperforms the recent SOTA methods across these three subsets. Furthermore, the detailed results of Hard and Medium actions are also provided in Fig. 5 and Fig. 6. The results indicate that our method significantly enhances performance on both hard-level and medium-level confusing actions, demonstrating its capability to differentiate ambiguous movements.

  "5 Conclusion and Discussion": "In this work, we introduce Frequency-aware Mixed Transformer (FreqMixFormer), a novel transformer architecture designed to discern discriminative movements among similar skeletal actions by Frequency Guidance Matters: Skeletal Action Recognition by Frequency-Aware Mixed Transformer MM'24, October 28-November 1, 2024, Melbourne, VIC, Australia leveraging a frequency-aware attention mechanism. This model enhances skeleton action recognition by integrating spatial and frequency features to capture comprehensive intra-class frequencyspatial patterns. Our extensive experiments across diverse datasets, including NTU RGB+D, NTU RGB+D 120, and NW-UCLA, establish FreqMixFormer's state-of-the-art performance. The proposed model demonstrates superior accuracy in general and significant advancements in recognizing confusing actions. Our research advances the field by presenting a method that integrates frequency domain analysis with current transformer models, paving the way for more precise and efficient action recognition systems.

  "B Partial DCT vs Full DCT Algorithms": "In FreqMixFormer, we utilize DCT in Frequency-aware Attention Block (FAB) to extract skeletal frequency features. As illustrated in Fig. 2 and 3 in the main paper, only Query matrix 𝑄 and Key matrix 𝐾 are processed with DCT and IDCT modules for attention score, Value matrix 𝑉 is only processed with linear transformation, the methodology can be found in Algorithm 1 as Partial DCT Algorithm. Moreover, we also investigate the Full DCT Algorithm, where DCT and IDCT process 𝑉 , and the methodology is shown in Algorithm 2. However, the full DCT algorithm performs poorly in the experiment: the full DCT algorithm only achieves 87.7% on the NTU-60 X-Sub setting, while the partial DCT algorithm achieves 91.5% accuracy. The overview of the FreqMixFormer with full DCT algorithm is illustrated in Fig. 8. The Spatial Attention Block (SAB) in this experiment is shown in Fig. 7 (a) and the Frequency-aware Mixed Former (FAB) with full DCT algorithm is shown in Fig. 7 (b). We hypothesize that the primary issues contributing to this gap are: 1) Applying DCT to 𝑄 and 𝐾 can effectively highlight key frequency features and improve the model accuracy by matching relevant features during the computation of attention scores. 2) By excluding 𝑉 from the frequency domain, the original temporalspatial information is retained. This retention may help preserve more detailed and dynamic information in the final representation, enhancing the model's ability to utilize these details for action recognition. 3) Recognizing actions relies not only on the frequency characteristics of movements (such as the speed and rhythm) but also on the specifics of how the actions are performed (like the swinging of an arm). Processing 𝑄 , 𝐾 , and 𝑉 in different domains may allow the model to balance these needs. Figure 7: (a) SAB utilized in this experiment. (b) FAB with full DCT algorithm.

  "C Evaluation of the number of DCT coefficients": "In order to explore the frequency operator in-depth, we conduct an evaluation of the number of enhanced DCT coefficients. Table 9 shows the extra ablation study on the number of DCT coefficients 𝑁 𝑐 that we set as high-frequency coefficients (the rest are set as low-frequency coefficients). The high-frequency coefficients are enhanced by a frequency operator coefficient 𝜑 discussed in Section 3.4 of the main paper. For a fair comparison, we keep 𝜑 = 0 . 5 during the experiments. As shown in the table, with the number of the enhanced DCT coefficient 𝑁 𝑐 = 12, the model achieves the best performance on NTU-60 (91.5% in X-Sub and 96.0% in X-View) dataset, and further increasing does not result in improvements.",

  "F.3 Channel Transformation in Temporal Attention Block": "As we mentioned in Section 3.4 of the main paper, we adopt some tricky strategies in the baseline method [69] as our temporal channel transformation 𝐶𝑇 (·) , which is stacked with two modules: 1) Channel Reforming Model.

  "H Limitations and Future Work": "Despite the high accuracy of our model, it still has some limitations. Firstly, our model is still not efficient and lightweight enough. As we discussed in the ablation study from the main paper, there is a gap between our method and the recent GCN-based methods such as HD-GCN [23] (1.68M parameters vs 2.04M, 1.60 GFLIOPS vs 2.40 GFLOPS), and we have no remarkable advantages of efficiency over the recent transformer-based methods. Secondly, we keep all the high-frequency coefficients during the training, which is not robust to noisy joint information. The more efficient way is to enhance the high-frequency coefficients selectively instead of the whole coefficients. Our future work will focus on finding the best trade-off point between efficiency and accuracy.
