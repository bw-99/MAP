Solar colors have been determined on the uvby-\u03b2 photometric system to test absolute solar fluxes, to examine colors predicted by model atmospheres as a function of stellar parameters (T eff , log g, [Fe/H]), and to probe zero-points of T eff and metallicity scales. Methods. New uvby-\u03b2 photometry is presented for 73 solar-twin candidates. Most stars of our sample have also been observed spectroscopically to obtain accurate stellar parameters. Using the stars that most closely resemble the Sun, and complementing our data with photometry available in the literature, the solar colors on the uvby-\u03b2 system have been inferred. Our solar colors are compared with synthetic solar colors computed from absolute solar spectra and from the latest Kurucz (ATLAS9) and MARCS model atmospheres. The zero-points of different T eff and metallicity scales are verified and corrections are proposed. Results. Our solar colors are (by) \u2299 = 0.4105\u00b10.0015, m 1,\u2299 = 0.2122\u00b10.0018, c 1,\u2299 = 0.3319\u00b10.0054, and \u03b2 \u2299 = 2.5915\u00b10.0024. The (b-y) \u2299 and m 1,\u2299 colors obtained from absolute spectrophotometry of the Sun agree within 3-\u03c3 with the solar colors derived here when the photometric zero-points are determined from either the STIS HST observations of Vega or an ATLAS9 Vega model, but the c 1,\u2299 and \u03b2 \u2299 synthetic colors inferred from absolute solar spectra agree with our solar colors only when the zero-points based on the ATLAS9 model are adopted. The Kurucz solar model provides a better fit to our observations than the MARCS model. For photometric values computed from the Kurucz models, (by) \u2299 and m 1,\u2299 are in excellent agreement with our solar colors independently of the adopted zero-points, but for c 1,\u2299 and \u03b2 \u2299 agreement is found only when adopting the ATLAS9 zero-points. The c 1,\u2299 color computed from both the Kurucz and MARCS models is the most discrepant, probably revealing problems either with the models or observations in the u band. The T eff calibration of Alonso and collaborators has the poorest performance (\u223c140 K off), while the relation of Casagrande and collaborators is the most accurate (within 10 K). We confirm that the Ram\u00edrez & Mel\u00e9ndez uvby metallicity calibration, recommended by \u00c1rnad\u00f3ttir and collaborators to obtain [Fe/H] in F, G, and K dwarfs, needs a small (\u223c10%) zero-point correction to place the stars and the Sun on the same metallicity scale. Finally, we confirm that the c 1 index in solar analogs has a strong metallicity sensitivity.", "sections": [{"heading": "Introduction", "text": "Photometry in the uvby-\u03b2 system (Str\u00f6mgren, 1963;Crawford, 1966) is well suited to the determination of basic stellar atmospheric parameters for F-, G-, and K-type stars through the color indices (b-y), m 1 = (v-b) -(b-y) and c 1 = (uv) -(v-b). Several empirical calibrations exist in the literature to transform (b-y) or \u03b2 to T eff (e.g. Alonso et al., 1996Alonso et al., , 1999;;Clem et al., 2004;Ram\u00edrez & Mel\u00e9ndez, 2005b, hereafter RM05b;Holmberg et al., 2007;Casagrande et al., 2010), while the m 1 index can be used to determine [Fe/H] in dwarfs (e.g. Str\u00f6mgren, 1964;Gustafsson & Nissen, 1972;Olsen, 1984;Schuster & Nissen, 1989;Malyuto, 1994;Haywood, 2002;Martell & Laughlin, 2002;Martell & Smith, 2004;Ram\u00edrez & Mel\u00e9ndez, 2005a, hereafter RM05a;Twarog et al., 2007;Holmberg et al., 2007) and giants (e.g. Bond, 1980;Arellano Ferro & Mantegazza, 1996;Hilker, 2000; \u22c6 Based on observations collected at the H.L. Johnson 1.5 m telescope at the Observatorio Astron\u00f3mico Nacional at San Pedro M\u00e1rtir, Baja California, M\u00e9xico. Ram\u00edrez & Mel\u00e9ndez, 2004;Calamida et al., 2007Calamida et al., , 2009)), as reviewed by \u00c1rnad\u00f3ttir et al. (2010). The evolutionary stage of stars can be determined using the c 1 index together with other uvby color indices (e.g. Crawford, 1975;Olsen, 1984;Nissen & Schuster, 1991;Schuster et al., 2004;Twarog et al., 2007).\nSince there are many difficulties in observing the Sun with the same instrumentation as we observe other stars (e.g. Stebbins & Kron, 1957;Gallou\u00ebtte, 1964;Clements & Neff, 1979;Tueg, 1982;Lockwood et al., 1992), the Sun cannot be used to set the zero-points of transformations between color indices and fundamental stellar parameters. Accurate transformations are important in many areas of astrophysics. For example, in the study of the primordial lithium abundance, an accurate T eff scale is needed to compare the Li abundance of metalpoor stars with that obtained from Big Bang Nucleosynthesis (e.g. Mel\u00e9ndez et al., 2010a;Sbordone et al., 2010). The terrestrial planet signatures found in the chemical composition of the Sun (Mel\u00e9ndez et al., 2009, hereafter M09;Ram\u00edrez et al., 2009, hereafter R09;Ram\u00edrez et al., 2010) shows that for accu-rate comparisons between the Sun and stars an accurate temperature scale must be used in the determination of chemical abundances. Although there is inconclusive evidence about whether the Sun is too metal-rich with respect to stars of similar age and Galactic orbit (Haywood, 2008;Holmberg et al., 2009) implying that the Sun could have been born in the inner part of the Galaxy (Wielen et al., 1996), this apparent offset between the Sun and stars could be partly due to zero-point errors in the photometric metallicity scale (see e.g. Table 3 of \u00c1rnad\u00f3ttir et al. 2010 for systematic differences between spectroscopic and photometric metallicities). Furthermore, we note that zero-point errors in the T eff scale, as well as errors in the metallicity scale, would introduce systematic errors in the ages of stars determined from isochrones.\nAccording to their similarity to the Sun, stars can be classified as \"solar-type stars\" (late F to early K stars), \"solar analogs\" (G0-G5 dwarfs with solar metallicity within \u223c a factor of 2-3), and \"solar twins\" (stars almost identical to the Sun) (e.g. Secchi, 1868;Cayrel de Strobel, 1996;Soderblom & King, 1998;M09). Many works have used either solar-type stars or solar analogs to infer solar colors to improve or check the effective temperature scale, the performance of model atmospheres, and the absolute flux calibration of the Sun (e.g. Pettit & Nicholson, 1928;Kuiper, 1938;Stebbins & Whitford, 1945;Stebbins & Kron, 1957;Johnson, 1962;Kron, 1963;van den Bergh, 1965;Croft et al., 1972;Olsen, 1976;Schuster, 1976;Barry et al., 1978;Hardorp, 1978Hardorp, , 1980a,b;,b;Clements & Neff, 1979;Cayrel de Strobel et al., 1981;Neckel & Labs, 1981;Chmielewski, 1981;Tueg & Schmidt-Kaler, 1982;Magain, 1983;Taylor, 1984;Mitchell & Schuster, 1985;Neckel, 1986;Vandenberg & Poll, 1989;Gray, 1992Gray, , 1995;;Straizys & Valiauga, 1994;Taylor, 1994;Cayrel de Strobel, 1996;Colina et al., 1996, hereafter C96;Hauck & Kunzli, 1996;Bessell et al., 1998;Mironov et al., 1998;Sekiguchi & Fukugita, 2000;Mel\u00e9ndez & Ram\u00edrez, 2003;RM05b;Holmberg et al., 2006;Pasquini et al., 2008;Rieke et al., 2008;Casagrande et al., 2010).\nSolar twins have spectra almost identical to the Sun (Cayrel de Strobel, 1996), hence are better suited to setting the zero-points of fundamental calibrations, especially since they are found without assuming a priori a temperature scale, but their identification is based purely on a model-independent analysis of their spectra with respect to a solar spectrum obtained with the same instrumentation. However, until only a few years ago one solar twin was known (18 Sco; Porto de Mello & da Silva, 1997; Soubiran & Triaud, 2004). The situation has changed dramatically with the identification of many stars similar to the Sun (Mel\u00e9ndez et al., 2006, hereafter M06;Mel\u00e9ndez & Ram\u00edrez, 2007, hereafter MR07;Takeda et al., 2007, hereafter T07;Takeda & Tajitsu, 2009, hereafter T09;M09;R09;Baumann et al. 2010, hereafter B10). It is now feasible to use solar twins with accurately determined stellar parameters to test the predictions of model atmospheres and the accuracy of empirical photometric calibrations. In the present work, we perform this study for the widely used uvby-\u03b2 system.", "publication_ref": ["b144", "b34", "b1", "b2", "b28", "b66", "b17", "b145", "b53", "b109", "b127", "b86", "b62", "b87", "b88", "b155", "b66", "b13", "b4", "b64", "b115", "b14", "b15", "b37", "b109", "b105", "b132", "b155", "b142", "b44", "b29", "b152", "b83", "b124", "b119", "b63", "b67", "b161", "b134", "b24", "b138", "b113", "b75", "b141", "b142", "b69", "b74", "b157", "b39", "b107", "b125", "b5", "b59", "b29", "b23", "b102", "b27", "b153", "b85", "b149", "b98", "b99", "b159", "b47", "b48", "b143", "b150", "b24", "b57", "b7", "b97", "b135", "b65", "b112", "b121", "b17", "b24", "b139"], "figure_ref": [], "table_ref": ["tab_4"]}, {"heading": "Photometric observations", "text": "", "publication_ref": [], "figure_ref": [], "table_ref": []}, {"heading": "Selection of the sample", "text": "Before starting our systematic survey of stars similar to the Sun in the Hipparcos catalogue, we performed pilot observations of solar-twin candidates to test our selection criteria. Our pilot study (M06) found zero-point offsets in our T eff scale (RM05b).\nWe therefore applied small corrections to the solar colors predicted by RM05b to increase our chances of finding stars resembling the Sun. In particular, we searched for solar twins around the Tycho color (B -V) T = 0.7225 instead of (B -V) T =0.689 predicted by our earlier color-T eff relations (RM05b). Our improved T eff scale (Casagrande et al. 2010) indeed corrected the zero-point problem, and now predicts a solar (B -V) T =0.730, in good agreement with our tentative correction.\nThe main parameters used to select solar-twin candidates from the Hipparcos catalogue were parallaxes and (B -V) T colors. Additional criteria used (when available) were other opticalinfrared colors (e.g. V T -K, b -y), photometric variability, information on multiplicity, previous literature values for [Fe/H] (obtained from an updated version of the Cayrel de Strobel et al., 2001, catalogue), rotation, and chromospheric activity. We found initially about one hundred stars satisfying our selection criteria within 75 pcs. We later expanded our search to cover the whole Hipparcos catalogue, increasing our sample by about 1/3.", "publication_ref": ["b17"], "figure_ref": [], "table_ref": []}, {"heading": "Observations and data reduction", "text": "The uvby-\u03b2 data presented here in Table 1 for the solar twins were taken using the H. L. Johnson 1.5 m telescope at the San Pedro M\u00e1rtir Observatory, Baja California, M\u00e9xico (hereafter SPM), and the same six-channel uvby-\u03b2 photoelectric photometer as for the northern observations of Schuster & Nissen (1988, hereafter SN), for all the uvby-\u03b2 observations of Schuster et al. (1993, hereafter SPC), the northern data of very-metal-poor stars by Schuster et al. (1996), the uvby-\u03b2 data for very-metal-poor stars in Table 1 of Schuster et al. (2004), and the uvby-\u03b2 data for high-velocity and metal-poor stars in Table 1 of Schuster et al. (2006). The new uvby-\u03b2 values for solar twins included here in Table 1 were taken during three observing runs in November 2007 (8 nights), April 2008 (7 nights), and September 2008 (4 nights).\nThe uvby-\u03b2 solar-twin data were taken and reduced using techniques very nearly the same as for SN and SPC (see these previous papers for more details). The four-channel uvby section of the SPM photometer is really a spectrograph-photometer that employs exit slots and optical interference filters to define the bandpasses. The grating angle of this spectrographphotometer was calibrated using a cadmium lamp at the beginning of each observing run to position the spectra on the exit slots to within about \u00b11\u00c5. Whenever possible, extinction-star observations were made nightly over an air-mass range of at least 0.8 (see Schuster & Parrao 2001;also Schuster et al. 2002), and spaced throughout each night several \"drift\" stars were observed symmetrically with respect to the local meridian (two hours east and then two hours west). Using these observations, the atmospheric extinction coefficients and time dependences of the night corrections could be obtained for each of the nights of observation (see Gr\u00f8nbech et al. 1976). Finding charts were employed at SPM to confirm identifications of the program stars and to select regions for the \"sky\" measurements. As for previous studies, such as SN and SPC, the program stars were observed at SPM to at least 50 000 counts in all four channels of uvby and to at least 30 000 counts for the two channels centered at H\u03b2. For all program stars, the sky background was measured until its contributing error was equal to or smaller than the error in the stellar count. At SPM, an attempt was made to obtain three or more independent uvby observations for each of the program stars, i.e. photometric observations during at least three independent nights; this aim was achieved, or exceeded, for all solar twins except HIP75923 and HIP77883 for which we obtained two observations each.\nAs for the SN and SPC catalogues, all data reduction was carried out following the precepts of Gr\u00f8nbech et al. (1976) using computer programs kindly loaned by T. Andersen (see Parrao et al. 1988). At SPM, the uvby-\u03b2 standard stars observed were taken from the same lists as for the previous catalogues, and are mostly secondary standards from the catalogues of Olsen (1983Olsen ( , 1984)). The reduction programs create a single instrumental photometric system for each observing run, including nightly atmospheric extinctions and night corrections with linear time dependences. Then transformation equations from the instrumental to the standard systems of V, (b-y), m 1 , c 1 , and \u03b2 are obtained using all standard stars observed during that observing period. The equations for the transformation to the standard uvby-\u03b2 system are the linear ones of Crawford & Barnes (1970) and Crawford & Mander (1966). Small linear terms in (b-y) are included in the standard transformation equations for m 1 and c 1 to correct for bandwidth effects in the v filter. Our y measurements were transformed onto the V system of Johnson et al. (1966).\nThirty-six uvby-\u03b2 standard stars were employed during the observing run of November 2007 providing instrumental photometric errors ranging from 0.002 mag. in (b-y) to 0.009 mag. in c 1 , and errors in the transformations to the standard photometric system from 0.004 to 0.011 magnitudes, respectively. For April 2008, these values were for 33 standard stars, 0.002-0.010 mag., and 0.005-0.013 mag., respectively, and for September 2008, for 35 standard stars, 0.002-0.008 mag., and 0.006-0.009 mag., respectively. Instrumental and transformation errors in the magnitude V and in the indices m 1 and \u03b2 were always intermediate in value between those given above.", "publication_ref": ["b129", "b132", "b133", "b130", "b50", "b50", "b111", "b108", "b109", "b35", "b36", "b70"], "figure_ref": [], "table_ref": ["tab_3", "tab_3", "tab_3", "tab_3"]}, {"heading": "The catalogue", "text": "Table 1 presents the uvby-\u03b2 catalogue for the 73 solar-twin candidates observed at SPM.

It has been well documented (e.g. SN; Olsen, 1983) that observations in the indices b-y, m 1 , c 1 , and \u03b2 made with simultaneous multichannel photometers are not affected in any significant way by light (or even moderate) cirrus, while the V magnitude, obtained from only the y band, is affected. For this reason, a few of the solar twins, such as HIP60314, HIP74389, and HIP118159, have fewer independent observations of the V magnitude than the indices.", "publication_ref": ["b108", "b109", "b35", "b36", "b108"], "figure_ref": [], "table_ref": ["tab_3"]}, {"heading": "Comparisons with other photometric data", "text": "We searched for uvby-\u03b2 photometry in the General Catalogue of Photometric Data (Mermilliod et al., 1997;Hauck & Mermilliod, 1998) and found data for 23 solar-twin candidates and 12 solar analogs (observed by ourselves spectro-scopically for other projects). The photometry of these 35 stars is given in Table 2.\nThe accuracy of uvby-\u03b2 photometry obtained at SPM has been extensively tested (e.g. SN;Arellano Ferro et al., 1990;Schuster et al., 1993Schuster et al., , 1996)), and we illustrate below that our solar-twin photometry is also in excellent agreement with the literature, in all cases with mean differences well below 0.01 magnitudes. There are 12 stars in common between our sample and previous work. The average difference (ours -literature) in (b-y) is only -0.001 (\u03c3 = 0.004). Our V Johnson photometry is also in good agreement, with a mean difference (ours -literature) of only +0.001 (\u03c3 = 0.006).

Adding other photometry available in the literature and using our own accurate stellar parameters (M09; R09; Mel\u00e9ndez et al., 2010b, hereafter M10b), and taking into account the variations in colors with T eff , log g and [Fe/H], we can infer the \"solar\" colors by interpolating them to the stellar parameters of the Sun: T eff = 5777 K, log g = 4.44, and [Fe/H] = 0.00 (e.g. Cox, 2000;Gray, 2005;RM05b).\nThe quality of our stellar parameters (M06; MR07; M09; R09; M10b) is very high because both the Sun (reflected light of asteroids) and the solar twins were observed with the same instrumentation during the same observing runs, and all data reduction and analysis were performed in an identical way. Our spectra have typically a resolution of 60,000 and S/N\u223c200 for stars observed with the 2.7m telescope at McDonald and S/N\u223c450 for stars observed with 6.5m Magellan Clay telescope at Las Campanas. Errors as low as \u223c25 K in T eff , 0.04 dex in log g, and 0.025 dex in [Fe/H] can be obtained in the best cases, and abundance ratios with errors as low as 0.01-0.02 dex have been obtained with the above data, showing that the Sun is a star with a peculiar chemical composition (M09; R09). Additional spectra available in the literature for solar-twin candidates were analyzed by B10 using similar techniques. The spectra are from HARPS observations available at the ESO archive and from the S 4 N database (Allende Prieto et al., 2004) foot_0 . In both cases, a solar spectrum taken with the same instrumentation was employed in the differential analysis.\nThe stellar parameters were determined homogeneously by our own group (M06, MR07, M09, R09, M10b, B10) using Kurucz model atmospheres and a line-by-line differential analysis with respect to the Sun. The T eff , log g, [Fe/H], and microturbulence were determined iteratively until both the differential excitation equilibrium of FeI lines and the differential ionization balance of FeI and FeII, were achieved. The microturbulence was also determined simultaneously, by requiring no dependence of the iron abundance (from FeI lines) on the reduced equivalent width.\nSince our solar-twin sample spans a relatively narrow range in atmospheric parameters relative to the Sun, in principle simple linear fits of color versus (vs.) each parameter (T eff , log g, and [Fe/H]) would provide sufficiently good estimates of the solar colors. As suggested by the referee, a global fit (e.g. Mitchell & Schuster, 1985) to all stellar parameters (color = f (T eff , log g, [Fe/H])) would be preferable due to the mutual interdependence of the stellar parameters. Fortunately our sample includes also solar analogs covering a broader range in colors and stellar parameters than the solar twins, so that the dependence on the different stellar parameters can be well determined by a global fit. The following formula was employed:\ncolor = A + B (T eff -5777) + C (logg -4.44) + D [Fe/H]. (1)\nThe advantage of this equation is that A will give us directly the solar color, while its uncertainty could be determined from the error in A or from the scatter of the fit.\nFrom our sample of stars, we selected a group of solar twins with T eff , log g, and [Fe/H] within 100 K, 0.1 dex, and 0.1 dex of the solar parametersfoot_1 given above. To perform a more robust global fit, we extended our solar twin sample with solar analogs covering a range in T eff , log g, and [Fe/H]. Thus, to explore the metallicity dependence of the colors, we selected a sample of solar analogs with the same constraints in T eff and log g, but covering a broader range in metallicity (-0.4\n< [Fe/H] < -0.1 dex, +0.1 < [Fe/H] < +0.4 dex).\nIn a similar way, to improve the fit to T eff , we selected a group of solar analogs with the same constraints on log g and [Fe/H] as the solar twins, but with T eff in the range (5617 < T eff < 5677 K, 5877 < T eff < 5937 K). Finally, to fit the trend with log g, we used a sample of solar analogs with the same constraints on T eff and [Fe/H] as the solar twins, but covering a broader range in log g (4.29 \u2264 log g < 4.34 dex, 4.54 \u2264 log g < 4.59 dex).\nThe stellar parameters were taken from our work on solar twins (M06; MR07; M09; R09; M10b; B10) and complemented in some cases with other accurate values available in the literature (Valenti & Fischer, 2005, hereafter VF05;Luck & Heiter, 2006, hereafter LH06;T07;Sousa et al., 2008, hereafter S08;T09). The adopted stellar parameters for the solar twins and solar analogs are given in Table 3.\nThe global fits to (b-y) had only three outliers, HIP 7245, HIP 81512, and HIP 88427, which seem too red in (b-y) for their T eff and [Fe/H]. Using the Karatas \u00b8& Schuster (2010) intrinsiccolor calibration, we find that these three stars may be slightly reddened (E(b-y) \u223c 0.015 -0.023), although we have to bear in mind that the accuracy of the reddening calibration is of the same order.foot_2 These stars were removed from the global fits. The results from the fits are presented in Table 4 and in Figs. 1234, where filled circles represent the solar twins and open circles the solar analogs across a broader range of stellar parameters.", "publication_ref": ["b33", "b49", "b0", "b98"], "figure_ref": ["fig_0", "fig_1", "fig_2"], "table_ref": ["tab_4", "tab_0"]}, {"heading": "The (b-y) solar color", "text": "The global fit of (b-y) (Fig. 1 and Table 4) shows strong dependences on T eff (at the 14-\u03c3 level) and [Fe/H] (10-\u03c3). There is no dependence (within the errors) on log g, therefore this parameter was excluded from the global fit. The star-to-star scatter from the fit is only 0.005 magnitudes, which is what is expected from the observational uncertainties (0.004-0.006 magnitudes).\nThe standard error (s.e.) in the solar color was obtained from the observed star-to-star scatter and the number of data-points (s.e. = \u03c3/ sample size). The error in (b-y) \u2299 (and the other solar colors) was conservatively adopted as three times the standard error. Thus, we propose (by) \u2299 = 0.4105 (\u00b10.0015).\n(2)\nA plot of (b-y) vs. V magnitude can help us to reveal whether fainter (i.e., more distant) stars bias the above derived solar color, due to possible interstellar reddening. This plot is shown in the lower left panel of Fig. 1. As can be seen, there is no trend with V magnitude. A linear fit of (b-y) vs. V, indeed shows a zero slope within the errors (slope = 0.0003 \u00b1 0.0008). We note that most stars of the sample used in the global fit are brighter than V = 9, i.e. closer than \u223c 68 pc. Even the faintest stars (V \u223c 9.3) extend only to \u223c78 pc. According to NaI interstelar absorption maps, very little NaI absorption is detected for distances up to \u223c 80pc from the Sun (Lallement et al., 2003;Welsh et al., 2010). Thus, most of our sample is not expected to be significantly affected by interstellar absorption.

We note that the trend seen in nearby stars for \u03b2 is not present in (b-y) because this color has opposite trends with T eff and [Fe/H].

As already noticed in the literature (e.g. Twarog et al., 2002;\u00d6nehag et al., 2009, hereafter O09), the c 1 index in late G dwarfs has a sensitivity to metallicity.

Following the suggestions of the referee, we explored whether this index is particularly sensitive to either anomalies in the chemical composition or the microturbulence velocities.\nPrevious works show the effects of C and N upon the Str\u00f6mgren 4-color uvby filter-measurements, via the NH and CN bands. For example, it seems that the NH band at 3360A affects the u measurements while CN affects the v measurements. Thus, the c 1 color that depends on both u and v should be affected by abundance anomalies (Bond & Neff, 1969;Bond, 1974;Zacs et al., 1998;Grundahl et al., 2000Grundahl et al., , 2002;;Schuster et al., 2004;Yong et al., 2008). In this context, it would be important to assess whether the small abundance anomalies in the solar chemical composition (M09; R09), in particular the difference between the highly volatile elements (C, N, O) and Fe, may affect the uvby colors. As discussed by Stromgren et al. (1982), variations in the He abundance may also affect the c 1 index. Although the Hyades c 1 anomaly for stars with (by) close to solar was found initially to be \u2206c 1 \u223c0.03-0.04 (Hyadesfield stars, or Hyades -Coma), it seems that the anomaly may only amount to \u2206c 1 =0.024-0.025 after instrumental effects are corrected (Joner & Taylor, 1995). Another important parameter affecting the colors may be microturbulence (Conti & Deutsch, 1966;Nissen, 1981).\nTo test the above effects, synthetic spectra were computed for solar twins with variations in \u2206[C,N,O/Fe]=-0.05 dex (M09), \u2206v micro = +0.1 km s -1 (most solar twins and close solar analogs have v micro within \u00b10.1 km s -1 of the solar value), and an increase of 10% in the He abundance (by number). Fluxes were computed with the code SYNTHE (Kurucz & Avrett, 1981;Sbordone et al., 2004;Kurucz, 2005) using ATLAS12 model atmospheres (Kurucz, 1996(Kurucz, , 2005;;Castelli, 2005) computed for the different aforementioned assumptions. The atomic line list adopted in the spectral computations is based on the compilations by Coelho et al. (2005) and Castelli & Hubrig (2004), and the molecules C 2 , CH, CN, CO, H 2 , MgH, NH, OH, SiH, and SiO from Kurucz (1993) were included. The change in He does not significantly affect the c 1 index (<0.001 magnitudes), but the change in microturbulence increases c 1 by +0.0035 mag., while the change in C,N,O increases c 1 by +0.003 mag. 4 Thus, small changes in chemical composition and microturbulence may help to explain the extra scatter seen in the global fit. Casagrande et al. (in preparation) demonstrate that the Str\u00f6mgren system is not only sensitive to [Fe/H], but that it is possible to obtain information about the [\u03b1/Fe] ratio using uvby photometry. The \u2206c 1 anomaly in the Hyades could be due to the effect of metallicity on c 1 . According to Friel & Boesgaard (1992), Hyades has an iron abundance 0.18 dex higher than Coma, which according to Table 4 corresponds to \u2206c 1 = +0.022 mag., which is very close to the Hyades anomaly relative to Coma (0.024-0.025 mag.)

Several previous works (Saxner & Hammarback, 1985;Gray, 1992;Edvardsson et al., 1993;Casagrande et al., 2010) give (b-y) \u2299 values that agree with ours within 0.005 magnitudes, but other determinations are either too blue (Cayrel de Strobel, 1996;Clem et al., 2004;RM05b;Holmberg et al., 2006) or too red (Gehren, 1981).

(2006) are very large (0.03 and 0.07 for m 1 and c 1 , respectively), so their solar colors cannot be used to perform stringent tests of model atmospheres and the temperature and metallicity scales.\nAlthough our inferred solar colors agree with previous determinations based on solar-type stars, our values based on solar twins should be preferred because of their more accurate and precise stellar parameters, resulting in correspondingly accurate and precise inferred solar colors.

However, additional ingredients enter the computation of synthetic colors, namely the adopted set of filters and the flux/magnitude zero-points adopted. We discuss them in the following.\nSince intermediate-band Str\u00f6mgren filters are centered on specific spectral features, a correct characterization of the total throughout becomes crucial for generating synthetic colors (e.g. Lester et al., 1986;O09). To test the influence of the filter transmission curves on our results, we computed uvby indices using two different sets of pass-bands, the original ones of Crawford & Barnes (1970) and a set that should be more representative of the SPM observations (Bessell, 2005).\nThe \u03b2 index is defined as the ratio of the flux measured through narrow (half-width of about 30 \u00c5) and wide (about 150 \u00c5) profiles both centered on the H\u03b2 line. In this case, the (212,214) filter transmission curves (Crawford & Mander, 1966), the photomultiplier sensitivity, the atmospheric transmission, and the reflectivity of aluminum given in Castelli & Kurucz (2006) were used to generate the total T \u03b2 throughout, according to the prescriptions of the beta.forcd program at the Kurucz website 6 . Indices calculated using T \u03b2 define the natural system \u03b2 \u2032 , which should be transformed using a set of equations to agree to the standard system \u03b2 defined by the observations of Crawford & Mander (1966). For the filter set (212,214), the transformation equation is \u03b2 = 0.248 + 1.368 \u03b2 \u2032 (Crawford & Mander, 1966).\nIn principle, to mimic the uvby-\u03b2 observations presented here, synthetic photometry should reproduce the SPM instrumental system, and the same transformation equations should then be applied to generate the standard system. In practice, this can hardly be done, since the SPM instrument is a sixchannel spectrophotometer, and we follow the approach normally adopted in the literature, i.e. of reproducing the standard system directly, by fixing the zeropoints using Vega. In Sect. 2.4, we have shown the excellent agreement between our observations and other photometric measurements, meaning that the transformation from the instrumental to the standard system is indeed accurate; we therefore expect our approach to return meaningful synthetic colors.\nThe spectral energy distribution adopted for Vega and its observed indices also affect the outcome of synthetic photometry in the process of establishing the zeropoints of a photometric system (e.g. Casagrande et al., 2006). We used a spectrum obtained with the STIS spectrograph onboard the HST (Bohlin, 2007) of resolution R = 500, which enables the highest accuracy (\u223c 1%) measurements achievable to date, and adopted the following averaged values for Vega: (b-y) = 0.003, m 1 = 0.157, c 1 = 1.088 and \u03b2 = 2.904 from Hauck & Mermilliod (1998). 5 Although the colors of the Sun measured using asteroids may be affected, our spectroscopic analysis based on high-resolution spectra should not because we measure the flux relative to the adjacent continuum for narrow spectral lines 6 http://kurucz.harvard.edu/programs/COLORS If we had adopted the colors of Vega given in Crawford et al. (1972), the differences would have amounted to 0.001 magnitude at most. Despite the complications posed by the pole-on and rapidly rotating nature of Vega, the effects on the blue part of the spectrum are expected to be small or negligible (e.g. Casagrande et al., 2006;Bohlin, 2007, and references therein). It is more relevant that we use the observed HST spectrophotometry of Vega; additional comments on this issue are made in the following subsections.", "publication_ref": ["b82", "b35", "b8", "b36", "b22", "b36", "b36", "b16", "b10", "b58", "b38", "b16"], "figure_ref": [], "table_ref": []}, {"heading": "Colors from Kurucz and MARCS models", "text": "Although synthetic uvby-\u03b2 colors computed using earlier MARCS and Kurucz models are found in the literature (see Table 5), we feel it appropriate to make our comparisons using the most recent releases available (Castelli & Kurucz, 2004;Gustafsson et al., 2008). In addition, as we have already mentioned, different ingredients enter the computation of synthetic colors, and we differ from most of the previous works in that we use an observed spectrum of Vega to define the zeropoints. In principle, this should be the best approach for replicating observations and for a correct comparison of solar flux models and absolute measurements with the colors determined from our solar twins. This choice mimics the observational approach, and the successes or failures of synthetic colors depend mostly on the quality of the solar input spectra. In practice, the situation is less clear, as we discuss further below and in Sect. 6.2.\nWhen computing synthetic colors from theoretical models, the use of a model atmosphere to describe also Vega may have the advantage of (partly) compensating for model inaccuracies by including these in the zero-points.\nWe performed this exercise by taking from the Kurucz website the latest ATLAS9 model fluxes for Vega and the Sun; because of the internal consistency of this approach, it should also determine which set of filters should be used. For the colors of the Sun we obtain (b-y) = 0.413, m 1 = 0.236 and c 1 = 0.297 using the filters of Crawford & Barnes (1970), and (by) = 0.406, m 1 = 0.214, c 1 = 0.303 for the Bessell (2005) filters. While (by) \u2299 is reproduced with the two set of filters, the latter set of filters provides results that are more comparable to our measured m 1,\u2299 and c 1,\u2299 , and therefore in the following we consider only the Bessell (2005) passbands. The effect of instead using those of Crawford & Barnes (1970) can be easily estimated from the above differences.\nThe resolution of the spectra used to generate synthetic colors may also in principle affect the results. We tested ATLAS9 model fluxes for Vega and the Sun at various resolutions ranging from R = 500000 to 200 and verified that for various combinations of these, differences in (b-y), m 1 and c 1 always lie below 0.001 magnitude. 7However, for R 2000 the synthetic \u03b2 index scales differently for Vega and the Sun, i.e. even if synthetic spectra of the same resolution are used for the two stars, the value obtained for \u03b2 depends on R to an extent that may vary from a few millimagnitudes up to several hundredths of a magnitude. For example, using high resolution ATLAS9 spectra for both Vega and the Sun, we obtain \u03b2 = 2.587, which is in good agreement with our solar value. Using instead synthetic spectra of Vega and the Sun at R = 500 sampled at the same wavelength points, we obtain \u03b2 = 2.601 from which we estimate a (model-dependent) correction of 0.014 magnitude when working at this low R.\nBecause of this limitation on the STIS resolution of the Balmer line, the \u03b2 indices computed for Table 5 have been obtained as follows: the solar spectra were downgraded to R = 500, sampled at the same wavelength points as the STIS spectrum, and the aforementioned correction was then applied. Using instead a high resolution ATLAS9 spectrum of Vega to define the zero-points does not require a downgrade to the resolution of the solar spectra, and the \u03b2 indices are changed by -0.030 magnitude (i.e. are bluer). We verified that for the other Str\u00f6mgren indices the STIS resolution is high enough. The effect of using an ATLAS9 model flux of Vega to set the zero-points amounts to -0.004, 0.006, and 0.027 magnitudes for the (b-y), m 1 , and c 1 indices, respectively. In Figure 5, synthetic colors obtained with these two choices for Vega, i.e. STIS vs. ATLAS9, are compared.\nIf the STIS spectrum of Vega is used, the Kurucz solar flux returns a value of (b-y) in excellent agreement with our observed value, whereas a considerably bluer color is obtained with MARCS. The greater accuracy of the Kurucz with respect to the MARCS solar flux in b and y bands can be noticed also from the spectrophotometric comparison presented in Edvardsson (2008). For m 1 , the Kurucz model is still in better agreement than the MARCS, one being slightly bluer and the other redder with respect to our m 1,\u2299 . The same bluer and redder performance is also obtained for c 1 , although both models provide a rather poor match. The \u03b2 index is similar for both models and considerably redder than our \u03b2 \u2299 .\nIn general, the ATLAS9 solar flux model performs better than the MARCS model, but they both have problems in reproducing c 1,\u2299 (in opposite directions) and \u03b2 \u2299 (both systematically redder). Changing to the ATLAS9 flux of Vega to set the zeropoints has a negligible impact on (b-y) and m 1 , but brings the theoretical \u03b2 index in almost perfect agreement in both cases. For the c 1 index, only the ATLAS9 result is helped by this choice, and this could partly stem from compensating errors in the ATLAS9 models of Vega and the Sun.\nIn Table 5, we also show the color indices computed by O09 using MARCS models (also for the flux of Vega) and the passbands of Crawford & Barnes (1970). Their (b-y) agrees with our synthetic one, but their m 1 and c 1 colors are somewhat redder and bluer, respectively, in a way that is consistent with the different passbands they adopted. The c 1 solar color computed by O09 is in excellent agreement (within 1-\u03c3) with our c 1,\u2299 .", "publication_ref": ["b55", "b35", "b8", "b8", "b35", "b41", "b35"], "figure_ref": [], "table_ref": ["tab_5", "tab_5", "tab_5"]}, {"heading": "Colors from solar spectra", "text": "We computed (b-y), m 1 , c 1 , and \u03b2 indices using the absolute measurements of solar spectra by C96, Neckel (1999, hereafter N99), and Thuillier et al. (2004). The spectrum of Rieke et al. (2008) was not employed because of its very low resolution (R \u223c 100). The STIS Vega observations and the ATLAS9 Vega model were again used to define the zero points.\nThe C96 composite spectrum represents both satellite (Woods et al., 1996) and ground (Neckel & Labs, 1984) observations below and above 4100 \u00c5. While its (b-y) is redder, m 1 is considerably bluer, and c 1 is in good agreement with our solar values. Not unexpectedly, the same conclusions about (by) and m 1 hold for the N99 atlas, which is an update of the Neckel & Labs (1984) measurements included in C96. However, Neckel (2003, hereafter N03) noticed a possible systematic error in those absolute measurements and provides a simple ana-lytical formula for correction, after which (b-y) and m 1 are in closer agreement with our solar values. Thuillier et al. (2004) published two composite solar reference spectra assembled using space measurements during distinct solar activity levels; differences concern only the m 1 and c 1 indices in a negligible manner (a few millimagnitudes only), and therefore in Table 5 the averaged values of the two are given. Thuillier et al. (2004) provide closer agreement than previous spectra in (b-y) and m 1 , but their c 1 is considerably bluer.\nThus, while on average (b-y) and m 1 are in agreement with our solar values, there is the tendency for c 1 to be considerably bluer. The \u03b2 indices were computed following the same prescriptions as in the previous section and are systematically redder. Switching to the model flux of Vega solves most of the discrepancies for these two indices, with the synthetic values being now distributed at the red and blue sides of our solar colors (see the right panel of Fig. 5). It is not obvious why a model flux for Vega also brings absolute solar flux measurements into closer agreement with our empirical solar colors. While the measured spectra of Vega should be superior to any model of it, we can speculate about possible reasons for this not being true over the full wavelength range. The difference STIS vs. ATLAS9 amounts to few millimagnitudes in (b-y) and m 1 , but is considerable in c 1 and \u03b2, and those differences could reflect measurement problems in the u band and the issue already mentioned about the spectral resolution around the Balmer line.\nIn the wavelength range of interest to us, the accuracy of the solar absolute fluxes is on the order of 5 -3% from data acquired in space (C96; Thuillier et al., 2004) and probably lower for ground-based data measurements. The culprit could thus be inaccuracy in solar flux measurements rather than in Vega! For the sake of computing indices, we are not interested in the absolute flux scale, but rather in the relative accuracy of measuring the shape of the solar spectral energy distribution. This accuracy is rather difficult to assess, but the above differences provide an idea of the complexity associated with this kind of measurement, and the corresponding rather large uncertainties. In addition, the choice for Vega and the set of filters used also affect the analysis, introducing systematic errors.\nIn this section, we have presented various issues concerning synthetic solar colors, which are often taken for granted when comparing observed vs. synthetic colors. While the comparison with a specific solar-flux measurement has limited significance, with appropriate choices for Vega, it is comforting that there are no large systematic trends between our solar colors and these observations taken together. Thus, our solar colors can help considerably in establishing the necessary reliability of synthetic colors.", "publication_ref": ["b151", "b121", "b162", "b103", "b103", "b151", "b151", "b151"], "figure_ref": [], "table_ref": ["tab_5"]}, {"heading": "Testing the effects of changes in T eff , log g, and [Fe/H] on synthetic MARCS colors", "text": "As discussed in the previous sections, our uvby-\u03b2 solar colors are useful for testing absolute solar spectra and the performance of model atmospheres, as well as checking the subtleties in the transformation from fluxes to synthetic colors.

The only clear discrepancy is in the predicted metallicity variation in \u03b2 (Fig. 2), which is much shallower than observed. We also checked whether the MARCS \u03b2 colors computed by O09 solve this problem (Fig. 2), but although they do help to slightly alleviate the discrepancy (the \u00d6nehag et al. \u03b2 colors are slightly steeper than ours), they also do not match the low \u03b2 indices observed below [Fe/H] \u223c -0.2.

These differences, shown in Table 6, are the zero-point corrections needed to place different T eff calibrations on the same T eff scale as the Sun. As can be seen, the T eff scale by Casagrande et al. (2010) seems the most accurate, with a negligible offset of only 10(\u00b110) K with respect to the Sun, which is much smaller than the offset (109 K) of our earlier T eff calibration (RM05b).\nThe widely used T eff (b-y) scale of Alonso et al.

Thus, the elemental chemical abundances determined using this scale (e.g. Israelian et al., 1998;Chen et al., 2000;Reddy et al., 2003;Allende Prieto et al., 2004;Jonsell et al., 2005) may be systematically incorrect by as much as 0.14 dex (e.g. for V from VI lines and for N from NH lines), albeit the impact on abundance ratios [X/Fe] should be smaller (and in a few cases mostly cancel) for lines of low to moderate excitation potential because of the compensating impact of the iron abundance obtained from FeI lines; however, for abundances obtained from lines of high excitation potential (e.g. CI, NI, OI, PI, SI) the impact could be as high as 0.2 dex. Thus, inaccurate temperature scales may be one of the reasons why the small peculiarities in the solar chemical composition (M09; R09) have not been discovered in the past (Ram\u00edrez et al., 2010).\nZero-point errors in T eff also affect stellar ages inferred from isochrones. For example, for an offset of 130 K and using Y 2 isochrones (Demarque et al., 2004), a systematic offset as high as 1.5-2 Gyr may result for a solar analog. \u00c1rnad\u00f3ttir et al. (2010) made a critical evaluation of different metallicity calibrations for dwarf stars in the uvby system, finding zero-point offsets in many of these metallicity scales, ranging from -0.17 dex (Nordstr\u00f6m et al., 2004) to +0.33 (O09), although the latter is a purely theoretical calibration intended to test model atmospheres and not for application to real stars. After extensive testing for potential problems in different metallicity calibrations, such as trends in the \u2206[Fe/H] residuals (spectroscopic-photometric) with [Fe/H], (by), c 0 , and m 0 , \u00c1rnad\u00f3ttir et al. (2010) find that the calibrations by RM05a has the best overall performance, albeit with a small (0.04 dex) zeropoint offset.", "publication_ref": ["b17", "b1", "b68", "b26", "b119", "b0", "b72", "b119", "b40", "b106"], "figure_ref": [], "table_ref": ["tab_1"]}, {"heading": "The zero-point of the metallicity scale", "text": "The zero-point offset cannot be overstated, especially when comparing the Sun to the stars (Gustafsson, 2008), because offsets in the zero-point of the metallicity scale could make the Sun appear abnormal (see Haywood, 2008;Gustafsson et al., 2010; and references therein for a discussion about apparent anomalies in the solar metallicity).\nOur solar colors can be used to check the zero-point of different metallicity calibrations, by computing [Fe/H] for our inferred solar colors and subtracting these metallicities from the solar metallicity ([Fe/H] = 0). Those differences, which are the zero-point corrections needed to place different metallicity calibrations on the same metallicity scale as the Sun, are shown in Table 7, along with the offsets found by \u00c1rnad\u00f3ttir et al. (2010) for a broad range of colors and metallicities.\nMost metallicity calibrations do require a correction to place them on the same metallicity scale as the Sun. In particular, the RM05a metallicity calibration recommended by \u00c1rnad\u00f3ttir et al. (2010) to derive [Fe/H] from Str\u00f6mgren photometry, needs a zero-point correction of +0.04 dex. This offset is identical to the offset found by \u00c1rnad\u00f3ttir et al. (2010) using a sample spanning a much broader range in T eff . We are currently revising the metallicity calibration employed in the GCS survey (Nordstr\u00f6m et al., 2004;Holmberg et al., 2007) and plan to assess the apparent anomalously high metallicity of the Sun with a new accurate metallicity scale (Casagrande et al., in preparation).", "publication_ref": ["b54", "b63", "b56", "b106", "b66"], "figure_ref": [], "table_ref": ["tab_2"]}, {"heading": "Conclusions", "text": "New uvby-\u03b2 photometry has been presented for solar-twin candidates observed at the SPM observatory. Comparisons with existing Str\u00f6mgren photometry shows that our data are in excellent agreement (to better than 0.01 mag) with previous observations. Using accurate spectroscopically derived stellar parameters, the uvby-\u03b2 photometry for the solar twins, and also for solar analogs covering a wider range in metallicities, the solar colors (by) \u2299 = 0.4105\u00b10.0015, m 1,\u2299 = 0.2122\u00b10.0018, c 1,\u2299 = 0.3319\u00b10.0054, and \u03b2 \u2299 = 2.5915\u00b10.0024 have been inferred.\nAs discussed in the manuscript, our solar-twin data have provided stringent constraints on absolute fluxes, the performance of model atmospheres, and the zero-points of temperature and metallicity scales. In particular, we show that the widely used Alonso et al. (1996) (b-y) calibration is too cool by \u223c140 K, while our new T eff calibration (Casagrande et al., 2010) has a negligible zero-point offset (10\u00b110 K). Regarding model atmospheres, the Kurucz ATLAS9 solar model provides a closer fit of our solar colors than the MARCS 2008 solar model. The relative variation in colors with stellar parameters seem to be reproduced well by MARCS models, except for the metallicity variation in the \u03b2 index, which is flatter than observed in solar twins and solar analogs, thus suggesting that there are existing limitations on the modeling of Balmer lines.\nWe are pursuing photometric observations of our solar-twin sample in other photometric systems, to perform similar evaluations of absolute fluxes, model atmospheres, and fundamental calibrations in astrophysics.
