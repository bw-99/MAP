This results in the multi-type and multi-scenario CVR prediction problem. A desired model for this problem should satisfy the following requirements: 1) Accuracy: the model should achieve fine-grained accuracy with respect to any conversion type in any display scenario. 2) Scalability: the model parameter size should be affordable. 3) Convenience: the model should not require a large amount of effort in data partitioning, subset processing and separate storage. Existing approaches cannot simultaneously satisfy these requirements. For example, building a separate model for each (conversion type, display scenario) pair is neither scalable nor convenient. Building a unified model trained on all the data with conversion type and display scenario included as two features is not accurate enough. In this paper, we propose the Masked Multi-domain Network (MMN) to solve this problem. To achieve the accuracy requirement, we model domain-specific parameters and propose a dynamically weighted loss to account for the loss scale imbalance issue within each mini-batch. To achieve the scalability requirement, we propose a parameter sharing and composition strategy to reduce model parameters from a product space to a sum space. To achieve the convenience requirement, we propose an auto-masking strategy which can take mixed data from all the domains as input. It avoids the overhead caused by data partitioning, individual processing and separate storage. Both offline and online experimental results validate the superiority of MMN for multi-type and multi-scenario CVR prediction. MMN is now the serving model for real-time CVR prediction in UC Toutiao.

In optimized Cost-Per-Click (oCPC) and Cost-Per-Action (CPA) advertising, advertisers seek to maximize conversions for a given budget [18, 22, 32]. The predicted CVR impacts both the ad ranking strategy and the ad charging model. Conversions have different types in nature (e.g., purchase a product vs. sign up an account) and ads can be shown in different display scenarios (e.g, shown as a banner on a page vs. interleaved with news in the news channel ), both of which highly impact the actual CVR. As an evidence, the ground-truth CVRs vary significantly over different conversion types (e.g., from 6.3% to 18.9%) and over different display scenarios (e.g., from 0.9% to 14.9%) in the Criteo dataset (Table 1). This results in the multi-type and multi-scenario CVR prediction problem. A desired model for this problem should satisfy the following requirements: 1) Accuracy: the model should achieve fine-grained accuracy with respect to any conversion type in any display scenario. 2) Scalability: the model parameter size should be affordable. 3) Convenience: the model should not require a large amount of effort in data partitioning, subset processing and separate storage. One approach to solve this problem is to build a separate model for each (conversion type, display scenario) pair. However, it is neither scalable nor convenient. Another approach is to build a Yanlong Du Alibaba Group yanlong.dyl@alibaba-inc.com CIKM '23, October 21-25, 2023, Birmingham, United Kingdom Wentao Ouyang et al. Figure 1: \ud835\udc34 and \ud835\udc35 are two input instances. (a) In multi-task learning, domains are the same and tasks are different. One input impacts the model parameters of all tasks. (b) In multidomain learning, domains are different and tasks are the same. One input impacts the parameters for that domain.

However, it fails to capture different natures of various conversion types and display scenarios, and is thus not accurate enough. In this paper, we formulate the multi-type and multi-scenario CVR prediction problem as a multi-domain learning problem. We would like to illustrate the differences between multi-task learning [5] and multi-domain learning [9] in Figure 1. In multi-task learning, domains are the same and tasks are different. For example, given a video, simultaneously estimating what rating a user will give and how long the user will spend on the video is a multi-task learning problem [31]. In multi-domain learning, domains are different and tasks are the same. For example, estimating the CVRs of two instances of conversion type 'purchase' and 'sign up' by the same model is a multi-domain learning problem. Moreover, in multi-task learning, one input impacts the model parameters of all tasks; while in multi-domain learning, one input only impacts the model parameters corresponding to that domain. Because of such differences, existing multi-task learning models such as SharedBottom, OMoE, MMoE, CGC and PLE [16, 17, 27, 31] cannot well address our problem. MT-FwFM [22], STAR [25] and ADIN [11] are more relevant state-of-the-art multi-domain models. However, as they are not designed for our problem, they also cannot satisfy the aforementioned three requirements. Given these limitations, we propose the Masked Multi-domain Network (MMN) in this paper. We will show how we design various strategies to make MMN simultaneously satisfy the accuracy, scalability and convenience requirements. The main contributions of this work are summarized as follows: (1) We propose the MMN model to address the multi-type and multi-scenario CVR prediction problem in a real-world advertising system. (2) In order to achieve the accuracy requirement, we model domain-specific parameters and we propose a dynamically weighted loss to account for the loss scale imbalance issue within each mini-batch. (3) In order to achieve the scalability requirement, we propose a parameter sharing and composition strategy to reduce model parameters from a product space to a sum space. (4) In order to achieve the convenience requirement, we propose an auto-masking strategy which can take mixed data from all the domains as input. It avoids the overhead caused by data partitioning, individual processing and separate storage. (5) We conduct both offline and online experiments to test the performance of MMN and several state-of-the-art methods for multi-type and multi-scenario CVR prediction.", "2 MASKED MULTI-DOMAIN NETWORK": "", "2.1 Multi-Type and Multi-Scenario CVR Prediction": "In omnimedia advertising platforms, different conversion types (e.g., purchase a product, sign up an account or fill out an online form) and different display scenarios (e.g., shown as a banner, interleaved with news or interleaved with micro-videos) highly impact the actual CVR. In the Criteo dataset (Table 1), the ground-truth CVRs vary significantly over different conversion types (e.g., from 6.3% to 18.9%) and over different display scenarios (e.g., from 0.9% to 14.9%). In our news feed advertising dataset (Table 1), the corresponding values vary from 0.05% to 27.6% and from 1.6% to 4.1% respectively. Denote the input instance as \ud835\udc65 , which contains multiple features, such as user features, ad features, context features and cross features. Denote the conversion type of the ad as \ud835\udc53 \ud835\udc61 ( \ud835\udc65 ) and the display scenario of the ad as \ud835\udc53 \ud835\udc60 ( \ud835\udc65 ) . Further denote the click label as \ud835\udc66 \u2208 { 0 , 1 } and the conversion label as \ud835\udc67 \u2208 { 0 , 1 } . Mathematically, the multi-type and multi-scenario CVR prediction problem is to estimate \ud835\udc5d ( \ud835\udc67 = 1 | \ud835\udc66 = 1 , \ud835\udc65, \ud835\udc53 \ud835\udc61 ( \ud835\udc65 ) , \ud835\udc53 \ud835\udc60 ( \ud835\udc65 )) . It is a feature-rich problem.", "2.2 Modeling Adaptive Parameters": "Figure 2 illustrates the structure of the proposed MMN model. It consists a CTR tower and multiple CVR towers. The inclusion of a CTR tower is to utilize the available data in the entire sample space (i.e., not only click data but also impression data) [18]. For simplicity, all the CTR and CVR towers use the multi-layer perceptron (MLP) consisting of several fully connected layers. We treat each (conversion type, display scenario) pair as a domain and create a CVR tower for each domain. But we use a parameter sharing and composition strategy to reduce the number of domain-specific parameters from a product space to a sum space. At the same time, these parameters can well capture each domain's specific properties. Given an input instance \ud835\udc65 , we denote the concatenated feature embedding vector after embedding lookup as x . We then generate the CVR prediction logit with ReLU activations [20] as  where \ud835\udf3d is the set of model parameters, \ud835\udc53 \ud835\udc61 ( \ud835\udc65 ) is the conversion type and \ud835\udc53 \ud835\udc60 ( \ud835\udc65 ) is the display scenario of the input instance \ud835\udc65 . One possible way to model \ud835\udf3d GLYPH<0> \ud835\udc53 \ud835\udc61 ( \ud835\udc65 ) , \ud835\udc53 \ud835\udc60 ( \ud835\udc65 ) GLYPH<1> is to create a separate set of parameters for each (conversion type, display scenario) domain to make the model adaptive, as illustrated in Figure 3(a). Denote the number of conversion types as \ud835\udc41 \ud835\udc61 and the number of display scenarios as \ud835\udc41 \ud835\udc60 . It will result in \ud835\udc41 \ud835\udc61 \u00d7 \ud835\udc41 \ud835\udc60 sets of parameters, which makes the model too large to be trained. In order to 1) capture commonalities across different domains, 2) reflect specific natures of different conversion types and display scenarios and 3) reduce the number of parameters, we design a parameter sharing and composition strategy as follows (illustrated in Figure 3(b)). In particular, we design  Masked Multi-Domain Network CIKM '23, October 21-25, 2023, Birmingham, United Kingdom Figure 2: Masked multi-domain network.

In this way, we avoid using samples that have both type \ud835\udc53 \ud835\udc61 ( \ud835\udc65 ) and scenario \ud835\udc53 \ud835\udc60 ( \ud835\udc65 ) to train a specific set of parameters as shown in Figure 3(a), and thus mitigate the data sparsity problem. Moreover, we only create \ud835\udc41 \ud835\udc61 + \ud835\udc41 \ud835\udc60 + 1 sets of domain-specific parameters, but can generate \ud835\udc41 \ud835\udc61 \u00d7 \ud835\udc41 \ud835\udc60 combinations to serve all different (conversion type, display scenario) domains. After we obtain the logit \u210e , the predicted CVR is given by \ud835\udc5d cvr ( \ud835\udc65 ) = \ud835\udf0e ( \u210e ) , where \ud835\udf0e is the sigmoid function.", "2.3 Auto-Masking": "The above design seems fine. However, the model needs to choose specific parameters for each instance according to its conversion type and display scenario. In modern deep learning systems such as Tensorflow [1], instances are processed in mini-batches with the same operators. As a result, how to process a mini-batch of instances simultaneously with the same operators but allow each instance to use different domain-specific parameters is still a problem. Previous works [4, 11, 21, 25] avoid this problem by splitting data into small per-domain datasets (Figure 3(a)). Accordingly, multiple input interfaces are created, one for each dataset.

The size of m \ud835\udc61 \ud835\udc56 \ud835\udc60 \ud835\udc57 equals the batch size \ud835\udc41 .

We show an example in Figure 4, where we have 4 instances, \ud835\udc53 \ud835\udc61 ( \ud835\udc4b ) = [ \ud835\udc61 1 , \ud835\udc61 2 , \ud835\udc61 1 , \ud835\udc61 2 ] \u2032 and \ud835\udc53 \ud835\udc60 ( \ud835\udc4b ) = [ \ud835\udc60 1 , \ud835\udc60 1 , \ud835\udc60 1 , \ud835\udc60 2 ] \u2032 . We then have    The mini-batch of instances go through all the CVR towers.

We then have  That is, the average loss applied on each domain is actually \ud835\udc41 \ud835\udc50 \ud835\udc41 \u00af \ud835\udc4e \u2264 \u00af \ud835\udc4e and varies from one domain to another. For each domain, we actually do not average over the instances corresponding to it but use an incorrect normalization value \ud835\udc41 . Therefore, we propose the dynamically weighted loss as   where \ud835\udc64\ud835\udc54\ud835\udc61 ( \ud835\udc65 \ud835\udc5b ) = \ud835\udc41 \ud835\udc41 \ud835\udc50 if \ud835\udc65 \ud835\udc5b \u2208 D \ud835\udc50 . Note that the weight \ud835\udc64\ud835\udc54\ud835\udc61 ( \ud835\udc65 \ud835\udc5b ) is not pre-computed before training, but dynamically computed within each mini-batch . This is why wecall the loss as dynamically weighted loss. In other words, even if two instances belong to the same domain, their weights could be different if they appear in different mini-batches because the number \ud835\udc41 \ud835\udc50 of samples in that domain could vary in different mini-batches.", "2.5 Fast Online Prediction": "As the online prediction is on demand, there is no need to let an online request go through all the CVR towers and use auto-masking to get the correct prediction. Given an online request \ud835\udc65 with the corresponding conversion type \ud835\udc53 \ud835\udc61 ( \ud835\udc65 ) and display scenario \ud835\udc53 \ud835\udc60 ( \ud835\udc65 ) , we simply let \ud835\udc65 go through the tower for ( \ud835\udc53 \ud835\udc61 ( \ud835\udc65 ) , \ud835\udc53 \ud835\udc60 ( \ud835\udc65 )) to calculate a single predicted CVR, i.e., until a colored node in Figure 2(a). This makes the online prediction of MMN fast.", "3 EXPERIMENTS": "", "3.1 Datasets": "The statistics of the datasets are listed in Table 1. (1) News feed conversion log dataset. This dataset contains a random sample of 14 days of ad impression, click and conversion logs from an industrial news feed advertising system for UC Toutiao. It contains \ud835\udc41 \ud835\udc61 = 19 conversion types and \ud835\udc41 \ud835\udc60 = 8 display scenarios. (2) Criteo conversion log dataset 1 . This dataset contains a sample of 90 days of Criteo live traffic data [26]. There are \ud835\udc41 \ud835\udc61 = 21 conversion types and \ud835\udc41 \ud835\udc60 = 17 display scenarios. All the features are hashed. Each training set is further split into an initial training set (70%) and a validation set (30%) to find the optimal hyperparameters.", "3.2 Methods in Comparison": "We compare three categories of methods. A. Single-task methods (1) DNN . Deep Neural Network [8]. It contains an embedding layer, several fully connected layers and an output layer. (2) ESMM . Entire Space Multi-task Model [18]. It models both CVR and CTR prediction tasks. B. Multi-task methods (3) MMoE . Multi-gate Mixture-of-Experts model [17]. It substitutes the shared bottom network with an MoE layer. Each task has a separate gating network. (4) PLE . Progressive Layered Extraction model [27]. It separates shared components and task-specific components explicitly and adopts a progressive routing mechanism. C. Multi-domain methods (5) MT-FwFM . Multi-Task Field-weighted Factorization Machine [22]. As it models type-specific parameters for multitype CVR prediction, we classify it as a multi-domain method. (6) STAR . Star Topology Adaptive Recommender [25]. It is proposed for CTR prediction over multiple business domains such as 'Banner' and 'Guess What You Like'. (7) MMN . Masked Multi-domain Network in this paper. Parameter Settings: We set the dimension of the embedding vectors for features as 10. For neural network-based models, we set the number of fully connected layers in a CTR / CVR tower as \ud835\udc3f = 4 with units {512, 256, 128, 128}. All the methods are implemented in Tensorflow [1] and optimized by the Adagrad algorithm [10]. We run each method 3 times and report the average results.", "3.3 Evaluation Metrics": "Accuracy: The Area Under the ROC Curve (AUC) is a widely used metric for CVR prediction [22]. The larger the better. We calculate fine-grained metrics as per conversion type AUC and per display scenario AUC. In addition, we also calculate the average AUC over all the conversion types and display scenarios. Scalability: We use the number of sets of domain-specific parameters to evaluate the scalability. Convenience: We use the number of separate datasets needed to train the model to evaluate the convenience. 1 https://ailab.criteo.com/criteo-sponsored-search-conversion-log-dataset/ CIKM '23, October 21-25, 2023, Birmingham, United Kingdom Wentao Ouyang et al. Table 2: Test AUCs on the News Feed ad dataset. The best result is in bold font. Randomly selected conversion types / display scenarios that span the training CVR spectrum are shown. (type / scen.): a method optimizes only the type / scenario dimension because of the out-of-memory issue. A small improvement in AUC (e.g., 0.0020) can lead to a significant increase in online CVR. Table 3: Test AUCs on the Criteo ad dataset. The best result is in bold font.", "3.4 Offline Performance": "3.4.1 Accuracy. Table 2 and Table 3 list the test AUCs. As multitask methods are not quite suitable for our problem setting, MMoE and PLE perform even worse than single-task methods such as DNN and ESMM on the Criteo dataset. On the News Feed dataset, their performance is comparable. Multi-domain method STAR outperforms single-task methods such as DNN and ESMM. MMN achieves the highest AUC in most cases. It is because MMN has the ability to tackle both conversion type and display scenario simultaneously by design. In contrast, other multi-task / multi-domain methods can either optimize on the flattened type \u00d7 scenario space with significant data sparsity issue, or optimize only one dimension because of the out-of-memory issue. 3.4.3 Convenience. We use the number of separate datasets needed to train the model to evaluate the convenience. Single-task / multi-task methods use only one dataset and they are convenient. With the help of auto-masking, MMN also uses only one dataset. However, other multi-domain methods need to create a separate dataset for each domain and results in \ud835\udc41 \ud835\udc61 \u00d7 \ud835\udc41 \ud835\udc60 sub datasets. Compared with these methods, MMN reduces the number of separate datasets from 357 to 1 (i.e., 99.7% reduction) in the Criteo dataset and from 152 to 1 (i.e., 99.3% reduction) in the News Feed dataset. 3.4.2 Scalability. We use the number of sets of domain-specific parameters to evaluate the scalability. Single-task methods do not model domain-specific parameters and do not have the scalability issue. MMN models \ud835\udc41 \ud835\udc61 + \ud835\udc41 \ud835\udc60 + 1 sets while other multi-task / multidomain methods model \ud835\udc41 \ud835\udc61 \u00d7 \ud835\udc41 \ud835\udc60 sets of domain-specific parameters. Compared with these methods, MMN reduces the number of sets of domain-specific parameters from 357 to 39 (i.e., 89.1% reduction) in the Criteo dataset and from 152 to 28 (i.e., 81.6% reduction) in the News Feed dataset. 3.4.4 Ablation Study: effect of type-specific and scenariospecific parameters. Figure 5 plots the AUC difference between MMNand MMN (common params.). In MMN (common params.), we only use shared common parameters { W \ud835\udc59 \ud835\udc4f } \ud835\udc59 for all the domains. In other words, no type-specific and scenario-specific parameters are learned. It is observed that MMN outperforms MMN (common params.) in most cases. These results show that different conversion types and display scenarios do have their own properties and using the same parameter set cannot well capture individual properties. 3.4.5 Ablation Study: effect of dynamically weighted loss. Figure 6 plots the AUC difference between MMN and MMN (no dynamic weight). In the latter, we use the loss in Eq.(2) for model Masked Multi-Domain Network CIKM '23, October 21-25, 2023, Birmingham, United Kingdom (a) News Feed: AUC(MMN) - AUC GLYPH<0> MMN(common params.)

These results validate the effectiveness of the dynamically weighted loss.", "3.5 Online Deployment": "We deployed MMN in an industrial news feed advertising system for UC Toutiao which serves hundreds of millions of traffic every day. MMN is trained using a distributed CPU cluster which contains 8 servers each with 96 CPU core units and 512 GB RAM. By design, MMN can satisfy the scalability and convenience requirements. In practice, we do not encounter the out-of-memory issue when training MMN but when training STAR on the type \u00d7 scenario space. Moreover, MMN needs only one dataset to train the model, and it significantly reduces the data processing overhead. We conducted online experiments in an A/B test framework over 14 days in August 2022, where the base serving model is ESMM. By design, the online prediction time of MMN is short. In practice, the prediction time of MMNis 2.3 ms, which is only slightly longer than that of ESMM, which is 2.2 ms. MMN leads to clear online CVR increases in all the 19 conversion types and the 8 display scenarios, where the increases range from 3.2% to 12.6%. Moreover, the CPM (revenue) is increased by 5.1%. After the A/B test, MMN provides real-time CVR prediction for all ad traffic in our system.", "4 RELATED WORK": "CVR prediction. The task of CVR prediction [6, 13, 15, 23] in online advertising is to estimate the probability of a user makes a conversion event on a specific ad after a click event. [13] estimates CVR based on past performance observations along data hierarchies. [7] proposes an LR model for CVR prediction and [2] proposes a log-linear model.

ESM 2 [29], GMCM [3] and HM 3 [28] exploit additional purchase-related behaviors after click (e.g., favorite, add to cart and read reviews) for CVR prediction. But such behaviors are not always available in different advertising systems. Multi-task/multi-domain learning. In multi-task learning [14, 19, 24], the domains are the same and the tasks are different. In multi-domain learning [9, 12, 30], the domains are different and the tasks are the same. Because of such differences, existing multi-task learning models such as Shared-Bottom, OMoE, MMoE, CGC and PLE[16, 17, 27, 31] cannot well address our problem. MT-FwFM [22], STAR [25] and ADIN [11] are multi-domain models that are more closely related to our work. However, they cannot address both different conversion types and different display scenarios. Moreover, they are not designed to satisfy the scalability and convenience requirements for our problem.", "5 CONCLUSION": "In this paper, we present the design and evaluation of masked multi-domain network (MMN) to address the multi-type and multiscenario CVR prediction problem in a real-world advertising system. We design various strategies such as modeling domain-specific parameters, parameter sharing and composition, auto-masking and dynamically weighted loss in order that MMN can simultaneously satisfy the accuracy, scalability and convenience requirements as an industrial model. Experimental results show that MMN does achieve these requirements and it outperforms several state-of-theart models for multi-type and multi-scenario CVR prediction.", "REFERENCES": "[1] Mart\u00edn Abadi, Paul Barham, Jianmin Chen, Zhifeng Chen, Andy Davis, Jeffrey Dean, Matthieu Devin, Sanjay Ghemawat, Geoffrey Irving, Michael Isard, et al.
