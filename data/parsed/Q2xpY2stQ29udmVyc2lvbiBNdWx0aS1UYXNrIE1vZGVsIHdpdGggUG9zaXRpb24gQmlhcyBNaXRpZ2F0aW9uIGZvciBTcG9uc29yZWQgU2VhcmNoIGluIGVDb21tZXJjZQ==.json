  "1 INTRODUCTION": "Position bias, the phenomenon whereby users tend to focus on higher-ranked items of the search result list regardless of the actual relevance to queries, is prevailing in many ranking systems. Position bias in training data biases the ranking model, leading to increasingly unfair item rankings, click-through-rate (CTR), and conversion rate (CVR) predictions. To jointly mitigate position bias in both item CTR and CVR prediction, we propose two positionbias-free CTR and CVR prediction models: Position-Aware ClickConversion (PACC) and PACC via Position Embedding (PACC-PE). PACC is built upon probability decomposition and models position information as a probability. PACC-PE utilizes neural networks to model product-specific position information as embedding. Experiments on the E-commerce sponsored product search dataset show that our proposed models have better ranking effectiveness and can greatly alleviate position bias in both CTR and CVR prediction.",

ACM ISBN 978-1-4503-9408-6/23/07...$15.00 https://doi.org/10.1145/3539618.3591963 The phenomenon of position bias is commonly observed in many ranking and information retrieval systems, including digital advertising and recommender systems. Position bias is the tendency of users to pay greater attention to higher-ranked items, regardless of their actual relevance to the query. For example, the eye-tracking study [13] and [14] show that in web search, the highest-ranked items receive the most attention; the study of digital library recommendation system [5] discovers that items shown at the top positions are more often clicked regardless of their actual relevance. Acommonpractice from machine-learned ranking (MLR) models is to use implicit user feedback, such as click/no-click as training data labels. However, due to inherited position bias, these models tend to exhibit lower predicted click-through rates (CTR) for lowerranked items. This bias in prediction can then affect subsequent training data collection, leading to a persistent and cyclical effect. The accumulative position bias of the training data will skew the MLR model, leading to increasingly unfair item rank prediction [6]. To address this position bias problem, various approaches have been proposed, including factorization models [4], inverse propensity scores [9, 15, 19], deep neural network-based CTR prediction models [8, 17, 21], and more. Pioneering approaches such as [4] proposed a factorization model that decouples CTR into positionnormalized CTR and position bias, which are then estimated by an Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm framework. To remove the position bias for learning to rank models, a propensity-weighted empirical risk minimization framework is proposed in [15]. In [10], an unbiased LambdaMART model is proposed, which jointly estimates the biases at click positions and unclick positions and learns an unbiased ranker. Several literatures dedicate to the propensity estimation, such as [1, 2, 18]. Recently, increasing research studies correcting position bias in the deep-ranking models. In [12], the authors propose to combine recurrent neural network and survival analysis techniques to model unbiased user behaviors. [3] designs a neural-based Context-Aware Click Model with an examination predictor able to automatically learn the position bias during training. The existing methods primarily consider single-task objectives like CTR prediction. However, in E-commerce, typical ranking models can have multiple objectives, such as maximizing both CTR and CVR. Deep Multifaceted Transformers (DMT) [7] learns both CTR and CVR predictors by modeling multiple user behaviors simultaneously with bias mitigation and treats CTR and CVR prediction SIGIR '23, July 23-27, 2023, Taipei, Taiwan Yibo Wang et al. as two parallel tasks. However, item impression, click, and conversion processes have sequential dependencies and are all affected by position bias. Such dependencies are not leveraged in DMT. In this paper, two models, Position Aware Click-Conversion (PACC) and PACC with Position Embedding (PACC-PE) are proposed to model the sequential relationship and jointly mitigate position bias in both CTR prediction and CVR prediction. PACC is based on the following two assumptions: (1). whether an item will be seen is only related to its position; (2). after an item is seen, whether it will be clicked/purchased is independent of its position. PACC is built upon the probability decomposition presented in §2.2. PACC-PE is a variant of PACC, which adopts a neural network to model the product-specific position information as embedding. Compared to PACC, learning the product-specific position embedding with a neural network enables PACC-PE to achieve richer information and superior performance than PACC. Specifically, our work has the following contributions: · We propose to jointly learn position-bias-free CTR and CVR prediction models in a multi-task learning framework. By mitigating position bias, the proposed models achieve comparable performance as state-of-the-art models on CTR prediction and significant performance improvement on CVR prediction regarding weighted Mean-Reciprocal-Rank (MRR) [19], MRR, position-wise AUC (PAUC) [11], and AUC. · We conduct experiments on real-world E-commerce sponsored product searches. Our proposed models achieve better ranking effectiveness and greatly mitigate position bias.",
  "2 METHODOLOGY": "In this section, we first introduce our problem formulation and then present assumptions and theoretical basis. Finally, detailed explanations of our proposed PACC and PACC-PE models are provided.",
  "2.1 Notation and Problem Formulation": "We assume the training set to be 𝑇 = {( 𝑓 𝑖 , 𝑝 𝑖 ) → ( 𝑦 𝑐𝑡𝑟 𝑖 , 𝑦 𝑐𝑣𝑟 𝑖 )}| 𝑁 𝑖 = 1 , where 𝑓 𝑖 is features other than position of sample 𝑖 , 𝑝 𝑖 is the position of sample 𝑖 , 𝑦 𝑐𝑡𝑟 𝑖 ∈ { 0 , 1 } is the click label of sample 𝑖 , 𝑦 𝑐𝑣𝑟 𝑖 ∈ { 0 , 1 } is the conversion label of sample 𝑖 , and 𝑁 is the number of samples in 𝑇 . Therefore, our models estimate the two probabilities: 𝑃 ( 𝑦 𝑐𝑡𝑟 𝑖 = 1 | 𝑓 𝑖 , 𝑝 𝑖 ) , the probability of an item to be clicked according to features and position, and 𝑃 ( 𝑦 𝑐𝑣𝑟 𝑖 = 1 | 𝑓 𝑖 , 𝑝 𝑖 ) , the probability of an item to be purchased according to features and position. Besides, we use 𝑠 𝑖 ∈ { 0 , 1 } to represent whether an item is seen by the user or not.",
  "2.2 Assumptions and Theoretical Basis": "PACC is based on two assumptions: 1) whether an item will be seen by the user is only related to item position, which is 𝑃 ( 𝑠 𝑖 | 𝑓 𝑖 , 𝑝 𝑖 ) = 𝑃 ( 𝑠 𝑖 | 𝑝 𝑖 ) ; 2) if an item is already seen, whether it will be clicked/purchased is independent of item position, which is 𝑃 ( 𝑦 𝑐𝑡𝑟 𝑖 | 𝑓 𝑖 , 𝑝 𝑖 , 𝑠 𝑖 = 1 ) = 𝑃 ( 𝑦 𝑐𝑡𝑟 𝑖 | 𝑓 𝑖 , 𝑠 𝑖 = 1 ) and 𝑃 ( 𝑦 𝑐𝑣𝑟 𝑖 | 𝑓 𝑖 , 𝑝 𝑖 , 𝑠 𝑖 = 1 ) = 𝑃 ( 𝑦 𝑐𝑣𝑟 𝑖 | 𝑓 𝑖 , 𝑠 𝑖 = 1 ) . In addition to these two assumptions, two facts underlie PACC: 1) an item has to be seen before it can be clicked, which is 𝑃 ( 𝑦 𝑐𝑡𝑟 𝑖 = 1 | 𝑓 𝑖 , 𝑝 𝑖 ) = 𝑃 ( 𝑦 𝑐𝑡𝑟 𝑖 = 1 ∩ 𝑠 𝑖 = 1 | 𝑓 𝑖 , 𝑝 𝑖 ) ; 2) an item has to be clicked and seen before it can be purchased, which is 𝑃 ( 𝑦 𝑐𝑣𝑟 𝑖 = 1 | 𝑓 𝑖 , 𝑝 𝑖 ) = 𝑃 ( 𝑦 𝑐𝑣𝑟 𝑖 = 1 ∩ 𝑦 𝑐𝑡𝑟 𝑖 = 1 | 𝑓 𝑖 , 𝑝 𝑖 ) and 𝑃 ( 𝑦 𝑐𝑣𝑟 𝑖 = 1 | 𝑓 𝑖 , 𝑝 𝑖 , 𝑦 𝑐𝑡𝑟 𝑖 ) = 𝑃 ( 𝑦 𝑐𝑣𝑟 𝑖 = 1 ∩ 𝑠 𝑖 = 1 | 𝑓 𝑖 , 𝑝 𝑖 , 𝑦 𝑐𝑡𝑟 𝑖 ) . The probability of an item being clicked is represented as:",
  "2.3 Proposed Framework": "2.3.1 Overview. Figure 1 illustrates the architecture of our proposed models. In both models, CTR prediction and CVR prediction share the same feature embedding but have different model architectures and parameters. A neural network is utilized to adaptively learn what and how much information to transfer from CTR prediction to CVR prediction. Position information is modeled separately and combined in innovative ways with the click-conversion multitask model. With this novel framework, our proposed models can jointly alleviate the position bias of both CTR and CVR prediction. 2.3.2 Position Aware Click-Conversion Model. The model architecture of PACC is shown in Fig. 1a. Given the input feature 𝑓 𝑖 embedded as 𝑣 𝑖 , for task 𝑘 ∈ { 𝑐𝑡𝑟, 𝑐𝑣𝑟 } , the output of 𝑘 Tower is defined as 𝑇 𝑘 = 𝑔 𝑘 𝑡 ( 𝑣 𝑖 ) , where 𝑔 𝑘 𝑡 (·) is three linear layers each followed by a ReLU activation function and a drop-out layer. Then 𝑇 𝑐𝑡𝑟 is fed into a linear layer with a sigmoid function to calculate 𝑃 ( 𝑦 𝑐𝑡𝑟 𝑖 | 𝑓 𝑖 , 𝑠 𝑖 = 1 ) , which is the probability of an item to be clicked after it is seen. 𝑇 𝑐𝑡𝑟 is also fed into a linear layer followed by a ReLU activation function and a drop-out layer, whose output is 𝐼 𝑁 𝐹𝑂 𝑐𝑡𝑟 . Then 𝑇 𝑐𝑣𝑟 and 𝐼 𝑁 𝐹𝑂 𝑐𝑡𝑟 are concatenated and fed into an attention layer as 𝐴 𝑐𝑣𝑟 = 𝑔 𝑐𝑣𝑟 𝑎 ([ 𝑇 𝑐𝑣𝑟 ; 𝐼 𝑁 𝐹𝑂 𝑐𝑡𝑟 ]) , where 𝑔 𝑐𝑣𝑟 𝑎 is the function of the attention layer and 𝐴 𝑐𝑣𝑟 is the output. Then 𝐴 𝑐𝑣𝑟 is fed into a linear layer with a sigmoid function to calculate 𝑃 ( 𝑦 𝑐𝑣𝑟 𝑖 | 𝑓 𝑖 , 𝑦 𝑐𝑡𝑟 𝑖 = 1 , 𝑠 𝑖 = 1 ) , which is the probability of an item to be purchased if it is already seen and clicked. 𝑃 ( 𝑠 𝑖 | 𝑝 𝑖 ) , the probability of an item to be seen given the position, is modeled using a linear layer and a sigmoid function. Then 𝑃 ( 𝑠 𝑖 | 𝑝 𝑖 ) is multiplied by 𝑃 ( 𝑦 𝑐𝑡𝑟 𝑖 | 𝑓 𝑖 , 𝑠 𝑖 = 1 ) for 𝑃 ( 𝑦 𝑐𝑡𝑟 𝑖 = 1 | 𝑓 𝑖 , 𝑝 𝑖 ) and 𝑃 ( 𝑦 𝑐𝑡𝑟 𝑖 = 1 | 𝑓 𝑖 , 𝑝 𝑖 ) is multiplied by 𝑃 ( 𝑦 𝑐𝑣𝑟 𝑖 | 𝑓 𝑖 , 𝑦 𝑐𝑡𝑟 𝑖 = 1 , 𝑠 𝑖 = 1 ) for 𝑃 ( 𝑦 𝑐𝑣𝑟 𝑖 | 𝑓 𝑖 , 𝑝 𝑖 ) according to Eq.(1) and Eq.(2). 2.3.3 Position Aware Click-Conversion Model with Position Embedding. The architecture of PACC-PE is shown in Fig. 1b. Given 𝑣 𝑖 as the shared feature embedding of sample 𝑖 , for task 𝑘 ∈ { 𝑝𝑜𝑠,𝑐𝑡𝑟,𝑐𝑣𝑟 } , the output of 𝑘 Tower is defined as 𝑇 𝑘 = 𝑔 𝑘 𝑡 ( 𝑣 𝑖 ) , where 𝑔 𝑘 𝑡 (·) encodes 𝑣 𝑖 through three linear layers each followed by a ReLU activation function and a drop-out layer. 𝑇 𝑝𝑜𝑠 is then fed into a linear layer followed by a ReLU activation function and a drop-out layer, whose output is 𝐼 𝑁 𝐹𝑂 𝑝𝑜𝑠 . Then 𝑇 𝑐𝑡𝑟 and 𝐼 𝑁 𝐹𝑂 𝑝𝑜𝑠 are concatenated and fed into an attention layer as 𝐴 𝑐𝑡𝑟 = 𝑔 𝑐𝑡𝑟 𝑎 ([ 𝑇 𝑐𝑡𝑟 ; 𝐼 𝑁 𝐹𝑂 𝑝𝑜𝑠 ]) , where 𝑔 𝑐𝑡𝑟 𝑎 is the function of the attention layer and 𝐴 𝑐𝑡𝑟 is the output. Then 𝐴 𝑐𝑡𝑟 is fed into a linear layer with a sigmoid function to calculate 𝑃 ( 𝑦 𝑐𝑡𝑟 𝑖 | 𝑓 𝑖 , 𝑝 𝑖 ) , which is the probability of an item to be clicked. 𝑃 ( 𝑦 𝑐𝑣𝑟 𝑖 | 𝑓 𝑖 , 𝑝 𝑖 ) is obtained similar as 𝑃 ( 𝑦 𝑐𝑡𝑟 𝑖 | 𝑓 𝑖 , 𝑝 𝑖 ) . The difference between PACC and PACC-PE is that PACC models position information into a scalar while PACC-PE models productspecific position information into an embedding. Thus, PACC-PE focuses on representing product-related position information, which Click-Conversion Multi-Task Model with Position Bias Mitigation for Sponsored Search in eCommerce SIGIR '23, July 23-27, 2023, Taipei, Taiwan (a) Position Aware Click-Conversion Model Lincar Laycr Sigmoid Attention Concat Lincar Laycr Lincar Sigmoid RcLU Out IClick Towcr (Convcrsion Iower Lnear Layer ReLU Lincar RelU Drop Out Drop Out Sigmoid Position Embedding Dror Layer Lincar Laycr Lincar Concat concat Linear Laver Linear Layei Relu Drop Out Relu [Click Iowcr Conversion Tower RelU Lincar Layer RcLU Out Fealure Embedding Oror pror (b) Position Aware Click-Conversion Model with Position Embedding Figure 1: An overview of PACC and PACC-PE.

Besides, PACC-PE has high fault tolerance compared with PACC, where subsequent tasks will be greatly affected if the probability of a former task is predicted wrongly.

The restriction loss is based on the fact that an item has to be clicked before it can be purchased, which is defined as",
  "3 EXPERIMENTS": "",
  "3.1 Dataset and Data Preprocessing": "The training and testing query-item pair data are collected using Walmart 1 sponsored ads logs. The dataset is a real-world dataset with position bias, containing 4.2M training samples, 1.1M validation samples, and 7.5M testing samples. The extracted features are categorized into three types: categorical features, numeric features, and text features. The categorical features are transformed into one-hot vectors; the numeric features are normalized; and the text features are embedded using BERT [16] to calculate cosine similarity scores and element-wise product between query and ad item. The element-wise product obtained using 𝐵𝐸𝑅𝑇 𝑏𝑎𝑠𝑒 has a dimension of 768, whereas the dimensions of other features are much smaller. To prevent the element-wise product from overwhelming other features, we use PCA to reduce its dimensionality to 5. In addition, the position feature is transformed into a one-hot format.",
  "3.2 Evaluation Metrics": "Since the standard Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR) assumes that the clicked/purchased items are relevant while ignoring the position 1 https://www.walmart.com bias, we use weighted MRR [19] to evaluate ranking effectiveness, which is formulated as 𝑀𝑅𝑅 𝑚 = 1 ˝ 𝑁 𝑖 = 1 , ˜ 𝑦 𝑚 𝑖 = 1 𝑤 𝑖 𝑚 ˝ 𝑁 𝑖 = 1 , ˜ 𝑦 𝑖 𝑚 = 1 𝑤 𝑚 𝑖 1 𝑝 𝑖 , where 𝑚 ∈ { 𝑐𝑡𝑟, 𝑐𝑣𝑟 } , 𝑁 is the number of samples, 𝑤 𝑚 𝑖 = 1 𝑃 ( 𝑠 𝑖 | 𝑓 𝑖 ,𝑝 𝑖 ) is a weight of 𝑖 -th sample, 𝑝 𝑖 is the position of the 𝑖 -th sample and ˜ 𝑦 𝑚 𝑖 is the predicted label. 𝑤 𝑚 𝑖 is defined through the reciprocal of 𝑃 ( 𝑠 𝑖 | 𝑝 𝑖 ) which reflects the impact of position. For PACC, 𝑤 𝑚 𝑖 can be calculated in a straightforward way since 𝑃 ( 𝑠 𝑖 | 𝑝 𝑖 ) = 𝑃 ( 𝑠 𝑖 | 𝑓 𝑖 , 𝑝 𝑖 ) is obtained after training. To compute 𝑃 ( 𝑠 𝑖 | 𝑓 𝑖 , 𝑝 𝑖 ) for PACC-PE as mentioned in [15], we first swap 𝑝 𝑖 with 𝑝 𝑖 = 𝑟 for item 𝑖 . The probability of this item being clicked at position 𝑝 𝑖 = 𝑟 is  The probability of this item being clicked at position 𝑝 𝑖 is  With Eq. (5) and Eq. (6), the ratio 𝑃 ( 𝑠 𝑖 | 𝑓 𝑖 ,𝑝 𝑖 ) 𝑃 ( 𝑠 𝑖 | 𝑓 𝑖 ,𝑝 𝑖 = 𝑟 ) = 𝑃 ( 𝑦 𝑐𝑡𝑟 𝑖 = 1 | 𝑓 𝑖 ,𝑝 𝑖 ) 𝑃 ( 𝑦 𝑐𝑡𝑟 𝑖 = 1 | 𝑓 𝑖 ,𝑝 𝑖 = 𝑟 ) is obtained. Thus, the weight 𝑤 𝑐𝑡𝑟 𝑖 for PACC-PE is  which is proportional to 𝑃 ( 𝑦 𝑐𝑡𝑟 𝑖 = 1 | 𝑓 𝑖 ,𝑝 𝑖 = 𝑟 ) 𝑃 ( 𝑦 𝑐𝑡𝑟 𝑖 = 1 | 𝑓 𝑖 ,𝑝 𝑖 ) since 𝑃 ( 𝑠 𝑖 | 𝑝 𝑖 = 𝑟 ) is a constant for a fixed position 𝑟 . 𝑤 𝑐𝑣𝑟 𝑖 can be calculated similarly. In addition to the weighted MRR, we also apply the widely-used evaluation metrics: standard MRR, AUC, and position-wise AUC (PAUC) [11] to evaluate model performance. SIGIR '23, July 23-27, 2023, Taipei, Taiwan Yibo Wang et al.",
  "3.3 Experimental Results and Analysis": "3.3.1 Ranking Effectiveness. We compare the weighted MRR, MRR, PAUC, and AUC of our proposed models and the baselines PAL [8], AITM [20], and DMT [7] models. PAL is a single-task position bias mitigation model; AITM is a multi-task model; DMT is a multi-task position bias mitigation model. The evaluation results are reported in Table 1. For CTR prediction, all models perform similarly in terms of weighted MRR and MRR. PACC-PE outperforms the best baseline by 3.27%/2.64% in terms of PAUC/AUC with p-value = 0.0072 and confidence level > 99%. For CVR prediction, PACC-PE significantly outperforms all other baseline models regarding weighted MRR and MRR, increasing weighted MRR/MRR by 4.92%/4.07% with p-value = 0.0088 and confidence level > 99%. PACC also outperforms other baseline models. The substantial improvement in CVR prediction of our proposed models indicates that jointly mitigating position bias for both CTR and CVR and considering the sequential dependencies in order between click and purchase is effective for performance improvement. 3.3.2 Position Bias. To generally evaluate the ability of our proposed model in mitigating position bias, we randomly select 500 query-item pairs and visualize their probability of being clicked and purchased before and after swapping positions. To better interpret the predicted probabilities, the log odds function is used to project probabilities in log odds space. From Fig 2 and Fig 3, the sample points of PACC and PACC-PE fit better on 𝑦 = 𝑥 compared to AITM, indicating that swapping item positions with position 1 has less influence on the predicted probabilities of being clicked and purchased by PACC and PACC-PE. 3.3.3 Position Bias on Different Positions.

The smaller the position bias, the smaller the prediction changes due to swapping positions. The impact of swapping item positions is visualized in Fig 4. In Fig 4a and Fig 4c, 𝑃 ( 𝑦 𝑐𝑡𝑟 𝑖 = 1 | 𝑓 𝑖 ,𝑝 𝑖 = 1 ) 𝑃 ( 𝑦 𝑐𝑡𝑟 𝑖 = 1 | 𝑓 𝑖 ,𝑝 𝑖 ) and 𝑃 ( 𝑦 𝑐𝑣𝑟 𝑖 = 1 | 𝑓 𝑖 ,𝑝 𝑖 = 1 ) 𝑃 ( 𝑦 𝑐𝑣𝑟 𝑖 = 1 | 𝑓 𝑖 ,𝑝 𝑖 ) are used to measure the impact of swapping item positions on CTR prediction and CVR prediction, respectively. As in Fig 4c, swapping item positions almost has no effect on both CTR and CVR prediction for PACC-PE on all positions, indicating that PACC-PE has the ability to mitigate position bias on all positions. In Fig 4a swapping item positions has a large impact on the top few items and the last item in the ranking list for AITM. For items on the top, swapping them to position 1 improves the probability of being clicked and purchased, while for the last items swapping them to position 1 decreases the probability of being clicked and purchased. This phenomenon is counter-intuitive because intuitively swapping items to position 1 should increase the probability of being clicked and purchased. One possible explanation is that some items are safe choices, but not preferred. For these items, if they are ranked high, users will not click on them. But if they are ranked low, users may click them given no better items at the end of their browsing. In Fig 4b, 𝑃 ( 𝑠 𝑖 | 𝑝 𝑖 = 1 ) 𝑃 ( 𝑠 𝑖 | 𝑝 𝑖 ) is used to measure the impact of swapping item positions. The impact of swapping item positions for PACC is low compared to AITM, demonstrating the ability of PACC to alleviate position bias. For items at most positions, swapping positions to position 1 increases the probability of being clicked and purchased a little bit. One difference between PACC-PE and PACC from Fig 4c and Fig 4b is that for PACC, position bias of different items at the same position is the same, while for PACC-PE position bias of different items at the same position is different. This difference makes PACCPE more flexible to different items and conveys richer information.",
  "4 CONCLUSION": "To jointly mitigate position bias that exists in both item CTR and CVR prediction, we propose two position-bias-free CTR and CVR prediction models: Position Aware Click-Conversion and PACC with Position Embedding. In PACC, the position is modeled as a probability while in PACC-PE position is modeled into embedding. Our experiments and analyses illustrate that our proposed models achieve better ranking effectiveness than the state-of-the-art models and effectively mitigate position bias in all positions. Besides, PACCPE outperforms PACC in ranking effectiveness and position debias due to the rich information by modeling product-specific position information as embedding.
