  "ABSTRACT": "Wepresent the Learned Ranking Function (LRF), a system that takes short-term user-item behavior predictions as input and outputs a slate of recommendations that directly optimizes for long-term user satisfaction. Most previous work is based on optimizing the hyperparameters of a heuristic function. We propose to model the problem directly as a slate optimization problem with the objective of maximizing long-term user satisfaction. We also develop a novel constraint optimization algorithm that stabilizes objective tradeoffs for multi-objective optimization. We evaluate our approach with live experiments and describe its deployment on YouTube.",

(3) Ranking: Multitask predictions are combined into a single ranking score to sort all candidates [1, 2, 4, 10, 17, 20]. (4) Re-ranking: Additional logic is applied to ranking score to ensure other objectives, e.g. diversity [18], taking cross-item interaction into consideration. This paper primarily focuses on the ranking stage, i.e. combining user behavior predictions to optimize long-term user satisfaction. Most existing deployed solutions (e.g. Meta [1, 2, 17], Pinterest [10] and Kuaishou [4]) use a heuristic ranking function to combine multitask model predictions. As an example, given input user behavior predictions 𝑠 1 , 𝑠 2 , . . . , 𝑠 𝑘 , the ranking formula can be ˝ 𝑘 𝑖 = 1 𝑤 𝑖 𝑠 𝑖 with 𝑤 𝑖 being the hyperparameters. Then these systems apply hyperparameter search methods (e.g. Bayesian optimization, policy gradient) to optimize the ranking function. Typically the complexity of optimization grows with the number of hyperparameters, making it hard to change objectives, add input signals, or increase the expressiveness of the combination function. We formulate the problem as a slate optimization instead. The goal of the optimization is learn a general ranking function to produce a slate that maximizes long-term user satisfaction. Let us take a look at related work in the area of slate optimization for long-term rewards. In [13], the authors propose the SlateQ method, which applies reinforcement learning to solve slate optimization. One limitation of the work is it assumes a simple user interaction model without considering the impact of slate position on the click probability. In [3], the authors give an efficient algorithm for the combinatorial optimization problem of reward maximization under the cascade click model [5, 9], assuming the dynamics of the system are given as input. Existing slate optimization work typically assumes that future rewards are zero when a user abandons a slate, which is unrealistic. Platforms like video streaming services have multiple recommendation systems (e.g., watch page, home page, search page), where users might abandon one and return later through engagement with another. Hence, it is important to model and optimize the lift value of a slate, i.e. its incremental value over the baseline value of the user abandoning the slate. Another less studied but important issue when applying slate optimization at the ranking stage is the stability of multi-objective RecSys '24, Oct 14-18, 2024, Bari, Italy Yi Wu et al. optimization. Most recommendation systems need to balance tradeoffs among multiple objectives. Stability here refers to maintaining consistent trade-offs among these objectives when orthogonal changes, such as adding a feature or modifying the model architecture, are made to the algorithm. The stability is crucial for system reliability and developer velocity. To address these existing limitations, we present the Learned RankingFunction (LRF) system. Our main contributions are threefold: (1) Wemodeltheuser-slate interaction as a cascade click model [9] and propose an algorithm to optimize slate-wise long-term rewards. We explicitly model the value of abandonment and optimize for the long-term rewards for entire platform. (2) Weproposeanovelconstrained optimization algorithm based on dynamic linear scalarization to ensure the stability of trade-offs for multi-objective optimization. (3) We show how the LRF is fully launched on YouTube and provide empirical evaluation results. The rest of paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we define the Markov Decision Process(MDP) for the problem of long-term rewards slate optimization. In Section 3, we propose an optimization algorithm to solve the MDP problem. We show how we deploy the LRF to YouTube with evaluation results in Section 4.",
  "2 PROBLEM FORMATION": "",
  "2.1 MDP Formulation": "We model the problem of ranking videos using the following MDP: · state space S = U×{ 𝑉 | 𝑉 ⊂ V , | 𝑉 | = 𝑛 } . Here U is some user state space and 𝑉 is a set of 𝑛 candidate videos nominated for ranking from V , the universe of all videos. · action space A is all permutations of 𝑛 . The system will rank 𝑉 = { 𝑉 1 , 𝑉 2 , . . . , 𝑉 𝑛 } by the order of 𝑉 𝜎 ( 1 ) , . . . , 𝑉 𝜎 ( 𝑛 ) with action 𝜎 ∈ A . · P : S × A × S → [ 0 , 1 ] is the state transition probability. · reward function 𝑟 ( 𝑠, 𝜎 ) ∈ R 𝑚 is the immediate reward vector by taking action 𝜎 on state 𝑠 . We consider the general case that there are 𝑚 different type of rewards. · discounting factor 𝛾 ∈ ( 0 , 1 ) and initial state distribution 𝜌 0 . A policy 𝜋 is a mapping from user state S to a distribution on A . Applying policy 𝜋 on 𝜌 0 gives a distribution on user trajectory D( 𝜌 0 , 𝜋 ) defined as follows. Definition 2.1. We define D( 𝜌 0 , 𝜋 ) as the distribution of user trajectories when applying policy 𝜋 on initial state distribution 𝜌 0 . Here each user trajectory is a list of tuples (( 𝑠 0 , 𝜎 0 , 𝑐 0 ) , ( 𝑠 1 , 𝜎 1 , 𝑐 1 ) , . . . , ) Here 𝑠 𝑖 = ( 𝑢 𝑖 , 𝑉 𝑖 ) is the user state; 𝜎 𝑖 is a permutation action applied on 𝑉 ; 𝑐 𝑖 is the user click position (with a value of 0 indicating no click). We define cumulative reward for 𝜏 starting from timestamp 𝑡 as  and cumulative reward for policy 𝜋 as  The optimization problem is to maximize cumulative reward for a primary objective subject to constraints on secondary objectives: . Problem 1.",

  "2.2 Lift Formulation with Cascade Click model": "Let us follow the standard notation in reinforcement learning and define 𝑄 𝜋 ( 𝑠, 𝜎 ) as the expected cumulative reward taking action 𝜎 at state 𝑠 and applying policy 𝜋 afterwards; i.e.,  Below we will factorize 𝑄 𝜋 ( 𝑠, 𝜎 ) into user-item-functions; i.e., functions that only depend on user and individual item. Conditional on click position 𝑐 , we can then rewrite 𝑄 𝜋 ( 𝑠, 𝜎 ) as  As mentioned in Section 1, the reward associated with the user abandoning the slate ( 𝑐 = 0) can be nonzero. Notice that ˝ 0 ≤ 𝑖 ≤ 𝑛 Pr ( 𝑐 = 𝑖 ) = 1, so we can further rewrite 𝑄 𝜋 ( 𝑠, 𝜎 ) as  First, we simplify the term E [ 𝑄 𝜋 ( 𝑠, 𝜎 )| 𝑐 = 𝑖 ] for 0 ≤ 𝑖 ≤ 𝑛 with user-item functions. In order to do so, we make the \"Reward/transition dependence on selection\" assumption from [13] which states that future reward only depends on the item the user clicks. In other words for 𝑠 = ( 𝑢,𝑉 ) , (1) when 𝑖 > 0, E [ 𝑄 𝜋 ( 𝑠, 𝜎 )| 𝑐 = 𝑖 ] can be written as 𝑅 𝜋 𝑐𝑙𝑘 ( 𝑢,𝑉 𝜎 ( 𝑖 ) ) for 𝑅 𝜋 𝑐𝑙𝑘 being a user-item function (2) E [ 𝑄 𝜋 ( 𝑠, 𝜎 )| 𝑐 = 0 ] can be written as 𝑅 𝜋 𝑎𝑏𝑑 ( 𝑢 ) for 𝑅 𝜋 𝑎𝑏𝑑 being a user level function. We further define 𝑅 𝜋 𝑙𝑖 𝑓 𝑡 as 𝑅 𝜋 𝑙𝑖 𝑓 𝑡 ( 𝑢, 𝑣 ) = 𝑅 𝜋 𝑐𝑙𝑘 ( 𝑢, 𝑣 ) -𝑅 𝜋 𝑎𝑏𝑑 ( 𝑢 ) , being the difference (i.e., lift) of future rewards associated with the user clicking item 𝑣 compared to user abandoning the slate. Next, we simplify the term Pr ( 𝑐 = 𝑖 ) with user-item functions by assuming the user interacts with the slate according to a cascade click model [9]. To model the behavior of the user abandoning a slate, we consider a variant [3, 5] which also allows the user to abandon the slate, in addition to skip and click, when inspecting an item, as illustrated in Figure 1: Learned Ranking Function: From Short-term Behavior Predictions to Long-term User Satisfaction RecSys '24, Oct 14-18, 2024, Bari, Italy Figure 1: Markov Reward Process with Cascade Click Model Expected Video at Expected abandonment Abandon position Click reward given reward click Rabd (u) Scroll 1 _ Pabd(u, Video at Expected position 2 Click reward given click Abandon Pab(u, Vo(2) Definition 2.2. (Cascade Click Model) Given user state 𝑠 = ( 𝑢,𝑉 ) , where 𝑢 represents the user and 𝑉 represents the set of items, and a ranking order 𝜎 on 𝑉 , the Cascade model describes how a user interacts with a list of items sequentially. The user's interaction with the list when inspecting an item is characterized by the following user-item functions: · 𝑝 𝑐𝑙𝑘 : A user-item function where 𝑝 𝑐𝑙𝑘 ( 𝑢, 𝑣 ) represents the probability of user 𝑢 clicking on item 𝑣 when inspecting it. · 𝑝 𝑎𝑏𝑑 : A user-item function where 𝑝 𝑎𝑏𝑑 ( 𝑢, 𝑣 ) represents the probability of user 𝑢 abandoning the slate when inspecting item 𝑣 . Taking ( 𝑢,𝑉 ) , 𝜎, 𝑝 𝑐𝑙𝑘 , 𝑝 𝑎𝑏𝑑 as input, the Cascade model defines function 𝑃 𝑖 𝑐𝑎𝑠𝑐𝑎𝑑𝑒 that outputs the probability the user clicks on the item at the 𝑖 -th position (for 1 ≤ 𝑖 ≤ 𝑛 ) with the form:  « ‹ The probability that the user abandons the slate without clicking on any items is defined by the function 𝑃 0 𝑐𝑎𝑠𝑐𝑎𝑑𝑒 as:  Putting everything together, we can rewrite 𝑄 𝜋 ( 𝑠, 𝜎 ) as  We call equation (3) the lift formulation with cascade click model . A natural question is how to order items to maximize 𝑄 𝜋 ( 𝑠, 𝜎 ) when there is only a single objective. Interestingly, despite the slate nature of this optimization, we prove that the problem can be solved by a user-item ranking function. Theorem 2.3. Given user-item functions 𝑝 𝑐𝑙𝑘 , 𝑝 𝑎𝑏𝑑 , 𝑅 𝜋 𝑎𝑏𝑑 , 𝑅 𝜋 𝑙𝑖 𝑓 𝑡 as input, the optimal ranking for user 𝑢 on candidate 𝑉 maximizing 𝑄 𝜋 (( 𝑢,𝑉 ) , 𝜎 ) for a scalar reward function is to order all items 𝑣 ∈ 𝑉 by 𝑝 𝑐𝑙𝑘 ( 𝑢,𝑣 ) 𝑝 𝑐𝑙𝑘 ( 𝑢,𝑣 )+ 𝑝 𝑎𝑏𝑑 ( 𝑢,𝑣 ) · 𝑅 𝜋 𝑙𝑖 𝑓 𝑡 ( 𝑢, 𝑣 ) . Proof. In equation (3), 𝑅 𝜋 𝑎𝑏𝑑 ( 𝑢 ) only depends on users. Therefore, it suffices to optimize ˝ 𝑛 𝑖 = 1 𝑃 𝑖 𝑐𝑎𝑠𝑐𝑎𝑑𝑒 ( 𝑝 𝑐𝑙𝑘 , 𝑝 𝑎𝑏𝑑 , 𝑉 , 𝜎 )· 𝑅 𝜋 𝑙𝑖 𝑓 𝑡 ( 𝑢,𝑉 𝜎 ( 𝑖 ) ) . The rest of the proof follows Theorem 1 in [3]. □",
  "3 OPTIMIZATION ALGORITHM": "This section outlines the optimization algorithm for solving Problem 1, initially for the special case of a single objective; i.e., 𝑚 = 1 and subsequently extending to multi-objective constraint optimization.",
  "3.1 Single Objective Optimization": "Our algorithm employs an on-policy Monte Carlo approach [16] which iteratively applies following two steps: (1) Training: Build a function approximation 𝑄 ( 𝑠, 𝜎 ; 𝜃 ) for 𝑄 𝜋 ( 𝑠, 𝜎 ) by separately building function approximations for 𝑅 𝜋 𝑎𝑏𝑑 , 𝑅 𝜋 𝑐𝑙𝑘 , 𝑝 𝑐𝑙𝑘 and 𝑝 𝑎𝑏𝑑 , using data collected by applying some initial policy 𝜋 . (2) Inference: Modify the policy 𝜋 to be 𝑎𝑟𝑔 max 𝜎 𝑄 ( 𝑠, 𝜎 ; 𝜃 ) (with exploration). We outline the main steps in Algorithm 1 and discuss technical details in Section 3.1.1 and 3.1.2. 3.1.1 Training. The training data is collection of user trajectories (see Definition 2.1) stored in 𝐷 . Each user trajectory can be written as ((( 𝑢 0 , 𝑉 0 ) , 𝜎 0 , 𝑐 0 ) , (( 𝑢 1 , 𝑉 1 ) , 𝜎 1 , 𝑐 1 ) , . . . , . ) .

Here we simply apply Theorem 2.3 using the function approximation for 𝑝 𝑐𝑙𝑘 , 𝑝 𝑎𝑏𝑑 , 𝑅 𝜋 𝑎𝑏𝑑 , 𝑅 𝜋 𝑙𝑖 𝑓 𝑡 . We randomly promote a candidate to top with small probability as exploration.",
  "3.2 Constraint optimization": "Whentherearemultiple objectives, we apply linear scalarization [15] to reduce the constraint optimization problem to a unconstrained optimization problem; i.e., we find weights 𝑤 2 , 𝑤 3 , . . . , 𝑤 𝑚 and define the new reward function as 𝑟 1 + ˝ 𝑚 𝑖 = 2 𝑤 𝑖 · 𝑟 𝑖 .

  "Algorithm 1 Single objective optimization": "initialize FIFO data buffer 𝐷 initialize network 𝑅 𝑎𝑏𝑑 ( 𝑢, 𝑣 ; 𝜃 ) , 𝑅 𝑙𝑖 𝑓 𝑡 ( 𝑢, 𝑣 ; 𝜃 ) , 𝑝 𝑐𝑙𝑘 ( 𝑢, 𝑣 ; 𝜃 ) , 𝑝 𝑎𝑏𝑑 ( 𝑢, 𝑣 ; 𝜃 ) parameterized by 𝜃 and initial policy 𝜋 while 1 do Apply 𝜋 to collect 𝐾 user trajectories and add it into 𝐷 .

We address the problem by dynamically updating 𝑤 as part of the training. At a high level, we make the following changes to Algorithm 1: (1) Training: apply Algorithm 1 for 𝑅 𝑙𝑖 𝑓 𝑡 ( 𝑢, 𝑣 ; 𝜃 ) as a vector function for all the 𝑚 objectives separately. (2) Inference: We find a set of weights 𝑤 = ( 1 , 𝑤 2 , 𝑤 3 . . . , 𝑤 𝑚 ) and use the following ranking formula at serving time:  The weights are dynamically updated with offline evaluation. The algorithm is outlined in Algorithm 2, with details below. 3.2.1 Offline evaluation on exploration candidates. We apply our offline evaluation on a data set consisting of candidates that is randomly promoted as exploration during serving. Definition 3.1. We define 𝐷 𝑒𝑣𝑎𝑙 as {( 𝑢, 𝑣, 𝑟 𝑣 )| 𝑣 ∈ 𝑉 and is randomly promoted , (( 𝑢,𝑉 ) , 𝜎, 𝑐 ) ∈ 𝜏, 𝜏 ∈ 𝐷, } Here 𝑟 𝑣 is the reward vector 𝑟 (( 𝑢,𝑉 ) , 𝜎 ) if 𝑣 is clicked and 0 𝑚 otherwise. We use  as the offline evaluation result for 𝑖 -th objectives. Intuitively, we are computing the correlation between weight-combined lift on 𝑣 with the immediate rewards from showing 𝑣 . The correlation is computed on exploration candidates to make the evaluation result less biased by the serving policy. 3.2.2 Optimization with correlation constraint. With the offline evaluation defined above, we solve the following problem to update 𝑤 in Algorithm 2. Problem 2.   Intuitively, we would like to minimize the change to the primary objective while satisfying offline evaluation on secondary objectives. In the case of a single constraint (i.e., 𝑚 = 2), there is a closedform solution for the problem. To see this, the optimal solution for 𝑤 2 must be either 0 or be a solution that makes the constraint tight; i.e.,  It is not hard to verify that the solution for equation (4) is also the solution for a quadratic equation of 𝑤 2 that can be solved with closed form. Therefore, we can set 𝑤 2 be the best feasible solution from { 0 } ∪ { solution for equation (4 )} . When there is more than one constraint, we found that applying constraints sequentially works well in practice. One can also apply grid search as the offline evaluation can be done efficiently.",

Also see illustration in Figure 2. Lightweight model with on-policy training. The LRF system applies an on-policy RL algorithm.

  "4.2 Evaluation": "We conducted A/B experiments for Θ ( 𝑤𝑒𝑒𝑘 ) on YouTube to evaluate the effectiveness of the LRF. Metric trends are shown in Figure 3. Note that first three experiments describe sequential improvements to the production system; the last two experiments ablate certain components of the LRF. Evaluation Metric. Our primary objective is a metric measuring long-term cumulative user satisfaction; see Sec 6 of [7] for details. Baseline before LRF Launch: The previous system uses a heuristic ranking function optimized by Bayesian optimization [11]. Hyperparameters: Wetuned two types of hyperparameters when deploying the LRF: training parameters, such as batch size, are tuned using offline loss; reward parameters, such as constraint weights, are tuned using live experiments.

Top-line metric [% change] per experiment 0876 0.375 8 4.2.1 Initial Deployment of LRF. We initially launched a simplified version of the LRF that uses the CTR prediction from the multitask model and ranks all candidates by 𝐶𝑇𝑅 · 𝑅 𝑙𝑖 𝑓 𝑡 . It also uses a set of fixed weights to combine secondary objectives. The control was the previous production system, a heuristic ranking function tuned using Bayesian optimization. The LRF outperformed the production by 0.21% with 95% CI [0.04, 0.38] and was launched to production. 4.2.2 Launch Cascade Click Model. After initial deployment of the LRF, we ran an experiment to determine the efficacy of the cascade click model, i.e., replacing 𝐶𝑇𝑅 with 𝑝 𝑐𝑙𝑘 𝑝 𝑐𝑙𝑘 + 𝑝 𝑎𝑏𝑑 . Adding the cascade click model outperformed the control by 0.66% with 95% CI [0.60, 0.72] in the top-line metric and was launched to production. 4.2.3 Launch Constraint Optimization. We found metric trade-offs between primary and secondary objectives unstable when combining the rewards using fixed weights. To improve stability, we launched the constraint optimization. As an example of the improvement, for the same model architecture change, we saw a 13 . 15% change in the secondary objective pre-launch, compared to a 1.46% change post-launch. This post-launch fluctuation is considered small for that metric. 4.2.4 Ablating Lift Formulation. To determine the necessity of the lift formula, we ran an experiment that set 𝑅 𝑎𝑏𝑑 to be 0. Such a change regresses top-line metrics by 0.46% with 95% CI [0.43, 0.49]. The metric contributed from watch page recommendations actually increases by 0 . 2% with 95% CI [0.14, 0.26]. This suggests the importance of lift formulation as it is sub-optimal to only maximize rewards from watch page suggestions. 4.2.5 Two Model Approach. Wemakeseparate predictions for 𝑅 𝑎𝑏𝑑 and 𝑅 𝑐𝑙𝑘 . This is also known as the two-model baseline in uplift modelling [12]. The ranking formula is then 𝑝 𝑐𝑙𝑘 𝑝 𝑐𝑙𝑘 + 𝑝 𝑎𝑏𝑑 · ( 𝑅 𝑐𝑙𝑖𝑐𝑘 -𝑅 𝑎𝑏𝑑 ) . The experiment results show that our production LRF outperforms this baseline in the top-line metric by 0.12% with 95% CI [0.06, 0.18].",
