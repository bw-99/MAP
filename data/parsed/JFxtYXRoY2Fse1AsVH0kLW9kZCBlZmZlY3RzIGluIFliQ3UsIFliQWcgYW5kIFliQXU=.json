INTRODUCTION", "text": "The current best description of elementary particles and their interactions is given by the Standard Model (SM) of particle physics 1 . This model is capable of explaining almost all experimental observations and of accurately predicting a wide range of diverse phenomena, which is why over time it has been consolidated as a well-tested physical theory. However, it does not address some important observed effects, such as the matterantimatter asymmetry in the universe, the neutrino oscillations, and the existence and nature of dark matter and dark energy 2,3 . Over the past decades, many new theories and extensions of the SM have been proposed to explain these phenomena 3,4 . Testing and restricting these theories is important for advancing our understanding of the fundamental laws of physics.\nA promising way to test some of these theories is to search for effects due to the simultaneous nonconservation of spatial (P) and time-reversal (T ) parities in atoms and molecules, such as those arising from the electric dipole moments (EDM) of electrons 5 . Interactions between these EDMs and electromagnetic fields violate both temporal and spatial invariance 6 . Within a CPT -invariant theory (C refers to charge-conjugation symmetry), if T symmetry is violated, then the combined CP symmetry must also be non conserved, so that clearly a) Author to whom correspondence should be addressed. Electronic mail: agustin.aucar@conicet.gov.ar P, T violation implies CP non conservation 2 .\nThe sources of CP violation described by the SM lead to the prediction of a free-electron EDM d e of approximately 5.8 \u00d7 10 -40 e cm 7 . However, more sources of CP violation beyond those predicted by the SM are needed to explain, for example, the observed matter-antimatter asymmetry. The additional sources of CP violation would in turn lead to an increase in the magnitude of the electron EDM (eEDM), even bringing it into the reach of present day precision experiments 2 . Experimental searches for these phenomena are currently being carried out in atoms and molecules, taking advantage of the enhancement of the atomic and molecular EDMs. These arise from P, T -violating interactions, mainly those taking place between the eEDMs and the large internal atomic or molecular electric fields, and also other CP-odd nucleon-electron and nucleon-nucleon interactions 2,[8][9][10] . Currently, the lowest upper limit of the eEDM is set at |d e | < 2.1\u00d710 -29 e cm. This upper limit was reported after measurements conducted by the National Institute of Science and Technology (NIST) on the HfF + molecular ion 11 , and combining these results with those obtained by the ACME Collaboration in their analysis of the ThO molecule 12 . It is important to stress that if CP violation is assumed to arise exclusively from d e in the NIST experiment (i.e., if the scalar-pseudoscalar nucleon-electron couplings are neglected), then the upper limit would be |d e | < 4.1 \u00d7 10 -30 e cm. This lowest upper limit has already put considerable constraints on some of the theories beyond the SM 13,14 .\nIn the ground state of a molecule with zero nuclear arXiv:2408.15029v1 [physics.chem-ph] 27 Aug 2024 spins and a single unpaired electron there are two main contributions to its energy arising from P, T -violating interactions. These arise from the interactions between the EDMs of the electrons and the electromagnetic fields, and from the P, T -odd scalar-pseudoscalar nucleon-electron (S-PS-ne) neutral-current interactions 9,15 . Since the effects of the eEDM and the S-PS-ne interactions are enhanced by the molecular electronic structure, the two corresponding molecular enhancement factors W d (related to d e ) and W s (which enhances the S-PS-ne interactions) are of particular interest.\nThe choice of molecule for the measurements has a significant impact on the sensitivity due to, among others, the system-dependent enhancement of the P, T -odd effects. Since in paramagnetic molecules containing only one heavy element this enhancement scales roughly as the cube of the atomic number of the heavier nucleus to which the unpaired electron is strongly linked to 16,17 , some heavy-element-containing molecules have an advantage over other systems. Furthermore, practical experimental considerations play a crucial role in selecting a candidate for experiments. For example, the use of ultracold molecules increases interaction times and hence the experimental precision 18 . Therefore, laser-coolability of the selected molecule provides a clear advantage. Various molecular properties relevant for precision measurements (e.g., laser coolability and sensitivity to the measured phenomena, but also many others) can be determined theoretically before experimental investigations in support of such experiments. In particular, the enhancement factors cannot be measured and must be provided based on accurate electronic structure calculations.\nIn this work, we investigate the sensitivity of the YbCu, YbAg and YbAu paramagnetic molecules to P, Tviolating phenomena. These systems are of particular interest, since they contain two metal atoms. Theoretically, this means that these atoms can be laser-cooled separately and then associated into a molecule afterwards, eliminating the need to laser-cool the molecule as a whole 19,20 . So far, laser-cooling of Yb and Ag atoms has been demonstrated 21,22 . Laser-cooling of Cu and Au has not been demonstrated yet, but cooling schemes have been proposed 23 . Furthermore, these polar molecules have large molecular-frame electric dipole moments, due to the large electronegativity of the coinage-metal atoms, allowing for their easy polarization. In particular, YbAg is considered as a promising candidate for a next generation clock-transition eEDM measurement 20 .\nNo experiments have been performed so far on YbCu, YbAg or YbAu, but several experimental groups pursue ultracold formation of other Ag-containing molecules [24][25][26][27] . However, high-accuracy calculations of the potential energy curves, molecular-frame electric dipole moments, electric quadrupole moments, and static electric dipole polarizabilities of the present systems were recently performed 28 . Here we employ the fourcomponent (4C) relativistic coupled-cluster (CC) approach to calculate the enhancement factors of the P, Tviolating interactions between the eEDMs and the electric fields in the systems, W d , and of the P, T -odd S-PS-ne interactions, W s . The enhancement factors are determined for the ground states,\nX 2 \u03a3 + 1 2\n, of the three molecules. We also carry out an extensive computational study to assign uncertainties on the calculated values.\nIn paramagnetic systems containing at least one nonzero nuclear spin I, some internal nuclear interactions lead to nuclear spin-dependent molecular P, T -violating effects, such as magnetic interactions between the electrons and the nuclear magnetic quadrupole moment (NMQM), which appears for nuclear spin I \u2265 1 29,30 . These effects are, however, outside the scope of this work.\nSection II covers the main theoretical aspects of this work, detailing how both enhancement factors can be obtained from effective Hamiltonians. Then, Section III contains a description of the methods employed to calculate these factors, as well as the scheme use for geometry optimization. Next, Section IV presents the obtained enhancement factors and their dependence on effects such as the choice of the nuclear charge density model, the method for treatment of electron correlation, the choice of the basis set, and the internuclear distances. Finally, Section V contains a concise summary of our findings.", "publication_ref": ["b1", "b2", "b2", "b3", "b4", "b5", "b6", "b1", "b1", "b7", "b8", "b9", "b10", "b11", "b12", "b13", "b8", "b14", "b16", "b17", "b18", "b19", "b20", "b21", "b22", "b23", "b20", "b24", "b25", "b26", "b27", "b28", "b29", "b30"], "figure_ref": [], "table_ref": []}, {"heading": "II. THEORY", "text": "The P, T -violating interactions involving the EDMs of atoms or molecules produce non-zero linear Stark shifts in the limit of vanishingly small applied electric fields. These interactions originate from many different sources, but mainly from the EDMs of electrons and nucleons, as well as from the P, T -violating nucleon-nucleon current interactions and the P, T -odd electron-quark interactions 31 . In particular, for paramagnetic linear molecules in X 2 \u03a3 1 2 ground states, such as the systems treated in this paper, the interactions between eEDMs and electromagnetic fields and the P, T -odd S-PS-ne neutral-current interactions dominate 32 . In these cases, the effective spin-rotation Hamiltonian that includes only nuclearspin-independent P, T -odd interactions (i.e., neglecting the interactions between electrons and NMQMs) can be written as 9,33 \u0124P,T -odd\nsr = K W s,K k s,K + W d d e \u03a9,(1)\nwhere the P, T -odd dimensionless operator \u03a9 = \u210f -1 J e \u2022n is the projection of the reduced total electronic angular momentum operator J e /\u210f along the direction of the molecular-frame electric dipole moment, which is given by the unit vector n (for a linear molecule, it points from the negatively charged region of the system to the positive one, along the internuclear axis). Here, \u210f = h/(2\u03c0) is the reduced Planck constant. The sum in Eq. ( 1) runs over all the nuclei K in the system. In systems where one nucleus is significantly heavier that the other (and where the unpaired electron is mostly located on that heavy nucleus), this sum typically reduces to a single term. We also note that k s,K is specific to each nucleus K, i.e., it depends on both the proton and the neutron numbers. Both these points will become important later and are discussed in Section II B.\nTo compute the enhancement factors, the effects of the eEDM and the S-PS-ne interactions are taken as perturbations on the 4C relativistic Dirac-Coulomb (DC) Hamiltonian. Since d e and k s,K are small quantities, the effects arising from both interactions are minute. Therefore, first-order perturbation treatment will already yield highly accurate results.\nWithin the Born-Oppenheimer approximation, the 4C DC (clamped-nuclei) Hamiltonian is given by\n\u0124(0) = i c\u03b1 i \u2022 pi + \u03b2 i m e c 2 - K eV K (r i ) - 1 2 i\u0338 =j eV j (r i ) + 1 2 K\u0338 =L eZ K V L (R K ),(2)\nwhere\nV K (r i ) = 1 4\u03c0\u03b5 0 \u03c1 K (r \u2032 ) |r i -r \u2032 | d 3 r \u2032 V j (r i ) = - 1 4\u03c0\u03b5 0 e |r i -r j |(3)\nV L (R K ) = 1 4\u03c0\u03b5 0 Z L e |R K -R L | .\nIn Eq. ( 2), as well as in all this work, the SI system of units was used. Here, the operator V K (r i ) refers to the electrostatic potential produced by the nucleus K at the position of the i-th electron, V j (r i ) is the potential created by electron j at the position r i , and V L (R K ) is the electrostatic potential produced by nucleus L at the position of nucleus K. c is the speed of light in vacuum, m e is the electron rest mass, e is the elementary charge, \u03b5 0 is the permittivity of free space, \u03c1 K (r \u2032 ) is the charge density distribution of nucleus K at an arbitrary position r \u2032 , Z K and Z L are the atomic numbers of nucleus K and L, respectively, and r i , r j , R K and R L are the position vectors of the electrons i and j, and nuclei K and L, respectively.

In his seminal work, he introduced a P, T -odd perturbation term corresponding to a permanent eEDM into the one-electron Dirac equation in a Lorentz-covariant formulation. This term is analogous to the so-called \"Pauli moment\" interaction term (representing a QED interaction of the lowest order, for non-relativistic energies, between the electromagnetic field and the Pauli anomalous electric and magnetic dipole moments of the electron), but pre-multiplied by the pseudoscalar Dirac operator \u03b3 5 (see pp. 47-51 of Ref. 35).\nIn atoms or molecules with at least one electron whose spin is unpaired, the effects arising from these P, Tviolating interactions produce atomic or molecular (permanent) P, T -violating electric dipole moments that may be significantly larger than that of a free electron. In the past it has been shown that the P, T -violating EDM of these many-electron systems is mainly influenced by the electrostatic interactions between the eEDM of the unpaired electron and the internal electric fields 36 . Therefore, when calculating the molecular enhancement parameter W d (see Eq. ( 1)) it is possible to ignore effects such as the interactions between the eEDM and the magnetic fields, and also the electron-electron Breit interactions.\nWhen neglecting both, the interactions of the eEDMs with internal and external magnetic fields and the Breit interactions, the mean value of the Salpeter Hamiltonian can be equated to the expectation value of two different operators. One of these two effective Hamiltonians is the sum of only one-electron operators, while the other one also contains two-body operators. These two-electron contributions, however, have been shown to be considerably smaller than the one-electron ones in that particular effective Hamiltonian, and as such they can usually be safely neglected 8,36 .\nTherefore, by employing any of these two effective Hamiltonians (denoted henceforth as scheme 1 and scheme 2) to make theoretical predictions, one avoids having to treat the two-electron interactions of the Salpeter Hamiltonian, which are not negligible. The first of these effective Hamiltonians (i.e., within scheme 1) has the form\n\u0124eEDM eff-1 = -d e i (\u03b2 i -1)\u03a3 i \u2022 E(r i ),(6)\nwhere the operator vectors \u03a3 i are related to the Pauli matrices by the expression\n\u03a3 = \u03c3 \u2205 2\u00d72 \u2205 2\u00d72 \u03c3 ,(7)\nand E(r i ) is the total electrostatic electric field at the position of electron i, given by\nE(r i ) = -\u2207 i \uf8ee \uf8f0 K V K (r i ) + V ext (r i ) + j\u0338 =i V j (r i ) \uf8f9 \uf8fb .\n(8) Here, V ext (r i ) is the electrostatic potential produced by an external electric field at the position of electron i, and V K (r i ) and V j (r i ) are the electrostatic potentials given in Eq. (3).\nIn what follows, we neglect in Eq. ( 6) the effects arising from the external electric fields and from the electric field produced by the electrons, as their contributions to the molecular enhancement factors have been shown to be small 8,16,36 . In this way, the effective Hamiltonian of scheme 1 can be expressed as\n\u0124eEDM eff-1 \u2248 -d e K,i (\u03b2 i -1)\u03a3 i \u2022 [-\u2207 i V K (r i )] ,(9)\nand if the nuclear charges are modelled using point-type density distributions, then this effective Hamiltonian reduces to the operator used throughout this work,\n\u0124eEDM eff-1 \u2248 -d e K,i Z K e 4\u03c0\u03b5 0 (\u03b2 i -1)\u03a3 i \u2022 r i -R K |r i -R K | 3 ,(10)\nwhere its dependence with the atomic number of the nuclei in the system is explicit.\nThe second effective eEDM Hamiltonian, within scheme 2, is given by 36,37 \n\u0124eEDM eff-2 = i d e 2c e\u210f i \u03b2 i \u03b3 5 i p2 i ,(11)\nwith \u03b3 5 being the well-known 4 \u00d7 4 Dirac matrix defined as \u03b3 5 = i \u03b3 0 \u03b3 1 \u03b3 2 \u03b3 3 , where \u03b3 0 = \u03b2 and \u03b3 = \u03b2\u03b1 = \u03b3 1 \u00ee + \u03b3 2 \u0237+\u03b3 3 k (in terms of the Pauli matrices, \u03b3 0 = \u03c3 z \u22971 2\u00d72 and \u03b3 1,2,3 = i \u03c3 y \u2297 \u03c3 x,y,z , so that \u03b3 5 = \u03c3 x \u2297 1 2\u00d72 , with \u2297 implying a Kronecker product). Therefore, in the Dirac standard representation,\n\u03b3 5 = \u2205 2\u00d72 1 2\u00d72 1 2\u00d72 \u2205 2\u00d72 . (12\n)\nScheme 2 contains only one-electron operators within an approximation in which both the magnetic interactions and the electron-electron Breit interactions are neglected, reducing the computational complexity. However, a drawback of this effective Hamiltonian is in the fact that the non-relativistic limit of its mean value is not zero, while that of the Salpeter Hamiltonian vanishes 38 . Furthermore, scheme 2 does not allow analysis of the separate nuclear contributions to the calculated W d parameters. Within scheme 1, on the other hand, the the non-relativistic limit of W d is zero. While scheme 1 includes two-electron contributions (see Eq. ( 6)), these are much smaller than the corresponding one-electron counterparts 16,36 and can usually be neglected. Therefore, scheme 1 allows us to study the effective contributions to W d arising from each nucleus of the system, keeping the correct non-relativistic behavior, and using only oneelectron operators.\nThe interactions of the eEDMs with the internal electric fields can be taken as a perturbation on the DC Hamiltonian \u0124(0) of Eq. ( 2), and in such case the total (perturbed) electronic Hamiltonian is written as\n\u0124d = \u0124(0) + \u03bb \u0124eEDM , (13\n)\nwhere \u03bb is the strength of the perturbation, and \u0124eEDM can be either \u0124eEDM\neff-1\nor \u0124eEDM eff-2 . The corrections to the molecular electronic energy arising from the perturbed Hamiltonian can be obtained by using Rayleigh-Schr\u00f6dinger perturbation theory. A series expansion of the ground-state energy solution of Eq. ( 13), E d \u2126 (\u03bb), can be written around \u03bb = 0 as\nE d \u2126 (\u03bb) = E (0) \u2126 +\u03bb E d(1) \u2126 \u03bb=0 + \u03bb 2 2 E d(2) \u2126 \u03bb=0 +O(\u03bb 3 ), (14\n)\nwhere the subindices \u2126 indicate that the ground-state solutions |0\u27e9 of the unperturbed Hamiltonian \u0124(0) in a given fixed molecular frame and spin state fulfil the condition \u27e80| \u03a9|0\u27e9 = \u2126. For YbCu, YbAg and YbAu, it can be seen that |\u2126| = 1/2 28 . Furthermore, the energy\nE (0) \u2126 = \u27e80| \u0124(0)\n|0\u27e9 is the eigenvalue of the unperturbed Hamiltonian \u0124(0) in the same molecular frame. When only the leading-order corrections are retained, and taking into account the relation between the effective spinrotation Hamiltonian and the eEDM enhancement factor W d given in Eq. ( 1), it can be shown that this parameter is given as\nW d = 1 \u2126 d e dE d \u2126 d\u03bb \u03bb=0 = 1 \u2126 d e d d\u03bb 0 d \u0124d 0 d \u03bb=0 ,(15)\nwhere 0 d is the ground-state solution of the total (perturbed) Hamiltonian \u0124d .", "publication_ref": ["b31", "b32", "b8", "b33", "b34", "b36", "b7", "b36", "b7", "b16", "b36", "b36", "b37", "b16", "b36", "b28"], "figure_ref": [], "table_ref": []}, {"heading": "B.

The active space energy cut-offs for the virtual (unoccupied) and occupied orbitals were set to \u00b120 E h , \u00b110 E h and \u00b110 E h for YbCu, YbAg and YbAu, respectively. A smaller active space was used for the heavier molecules since computing their bond distances is computationally more intensive. The results of these geometry optimizations can be found in Table I along with the values obtained previously in Ref. 28.\nThe general trend observed for both sets of results is that the bond length increases from YbCu to YbAg and then decreases from YbAg to YbAu, likely due to the relativistic contraction of the 6s orbital of gold. A nonrelativistic treatment would show longer bonds for heavier systems 56 .\nThe discrepancy between the present and the previous values is likely due to the use of pseudopotentials (especially a large-core one with a core polarization potential for Yb) in the latter. ECPs are limited to scalarrelativistic effects, while the X2C procedure employed here also accounts for the spin-orbit coupling.

For YbCu and YbAg, the results using GN are \u223c 1.1% smaller than those obtained employing PN, while for YbAu the GN result is \u223c 9.2% larger than the one using a PN. The results were obtained on the FSCCSD/v2z level of theory with all electrons correlated and a symmetric virtual space cut-off and using Gaussian-type and point-like nuclear models (GN and PN, respectively). The hatched blocks correspond to the sum W s,Yb + Ws,X (X = Cu, Ag, Au).\nthe gradients of the nuclear densities have opposite directions. For YbAu, the two contributions almost cancel each other out, leading to a very small total value of W s .\nIn all three cases, the contribution of the ytterbium nucleus is reduced by \u223c 13% when going from PN to GN, while for copper, silver, and gold the reduction is \u223c 0.16%, \u223c 3.5%, and \u223c 20%, respectively. Thus, the effect of using a finite nucleus model becomes more significant for the heavier elements, as can be expected. The total absolute W s is also lower for the calculations performed using the GN model. It is well known that when only the electric field produced by the nuclei is taken into account in scheme 1, the two schemes described in Section II A should yield similar results for W d 36 . While the use of scheme 2 is computationally less demanding, since it requires just a single calculation per system instead of the two that are required for each diatomic molecule, scheme 1 allows us to examine the effective contributions arising from each nucleus. In order to study those individual contributions, in this work we present (to the best of our knowledge) the first four-component results of W d using the approximate effective Hamiltonian of Eq. ( 10), corresponding to the use of scheme 1.\nThe enhancement factors W d were computed using both schemes for the three systems considered in this work, on the FSCCSD/v2z level of theory, with symmetric cut-offs of 500 E h , 500 E h , and 40 E h , freezing 2, 4, and 56 electrons of YbCu, YbAg and YbAu, respectively. The calculations were only performed using a PN model (and not a GN nucleus), since some integrals required for scheme 1 for finite nuclear models, despite having been studied using two-component methods 16 , are currently not implemented in DIRAC.\nFigure 3 shows the difference in W d when computed with the two schemes for the three systems. The total YbCu W d calculated using scheme 2 is \u223c 1.5% smaller than the scheme 1 result. For YbAg, this difference is \u223c 1.4%. For YbAu, the reduction is \u223c 4.7%.\nUsing scheme 1, it can be seen that the contributions to W d from the Yb nucleus remain almost constant for all three systems. Moreover, the contributions from the coinage metals all have opposite signs to those coming from Yb, as is the case for the W s factors. This is expected, since the electric fields due to the two nuclei in the internuclear region have opposite directions, and according to Eqs. ( 9) and (10), this generates opposite contributions to this enhancement parameter. The decreasing total W d factor from YbCu to YbAu is due to the increasing contribution from the second nucleus (opposite to that of the first).", "publication_ref": ["b57", "b36", "b16"], "figure_ref": [], "table_ref": []}, {"heading": "D.

Tight functions should increase the accuracy of the description of the core region of the system, while diffuse functions should improve the accuracy of the description of the valence region of the system. The cvXz basis sets contain higher angular momentum tight functions, and the s-aug-vXz basis sets augment a diffuse function to the vXz basis set. These computations were done using the same computational settings as the ones above.\nThe effects of increasing the accuracy on the description of the core and valence regions of the systems is small for both enhancement factors.
