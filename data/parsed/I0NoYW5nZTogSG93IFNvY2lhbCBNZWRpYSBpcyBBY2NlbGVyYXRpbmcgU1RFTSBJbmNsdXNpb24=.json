This is the first in a series of white papers based on 2030STEM Salons-discussions that bring together visionary stakeholders in STEM to think about innovative ways to infuse justice, equity, diversity, and inclusion into the STEM ecosystem. Our salons identify solutions that come from those who have been most affected by systemic barriers in STEM.", "sections": [{"heading": "", "text": "Our first salon focused on the power of social media to accelerate inclusion and diversity efforts in STEM. Social media campaigns, such as the #XinSTEM initiatives, are powerful new strategies for accelerating change towards inclusion and leadership by underrepresented communities in STEM.

STEM fields have faced critical barriers in recruiting and retaining Black, Latino/a/x, and Indigenous individuals and other people of color. Eliminating these barriers is not simple. There is significant work ahead to achieve parity and representation in the STEM workforce [6]. As aptly stated by Dr. Winston Morgan, Director of Impact and Innovation in the School of Health Sport and Bioscience, University of East London, \"No Black Scientist has ever won a Nobel [Prize]-that's bad for science, and bad for society [7].\" The presence and visibility of a cultural and gender diversity of scientists is important towards overcoming disparities and achieving equity in STEM [8].\nHowever, Black, Latino/a/x, Indigenous and other historically underrepresented groups have not remained idle. In 2020, using collective action, people underrepresented in STEM took matters into their own hands-and online. Building on a burgeoning social media movement, several STEM affinity groups cultivated online communities that reflected their STEM fields, and equally important, their cultural STEM-identity using variants of the #XinSTEM hashtag.\nOur inaugural 2030STEM Salon focused on these numerous, new #XinSTEM initiatives. We explored the impact of these grassroots efforts, outlined barriers to their success, and developed recommendations for creating sustainability for #XinSTEM movements to thrive and to accelerate change.\nWHAT IS THE #XINSTEM MOVEMENT? \"#XinSTEM\" refers to a set of grassroots, social-media-based initiatives that foster inclusion, representation, and discussions of diversity across STEM fields. Many #XinSTEM initiatives are founded by graduate students or postdoctoral scholars, like Stephanie Page, who founded #BLACKandSTEM in 2014 while still a PhD student.\n#XinSTEM groups have proliferated to meet a need that is not being met and to combat entrenched power and privilege in STEM institutions and workplaces. These movements allow early-career (and other) researchers from underrepresented groups to connect, build community, and foster mentorship and advocacy across vast networks in real time. Communities share experiences and strategies for a myriad of activities that allow them to: For the first time ever, in a virtual global community, underrepresented students, researchers, professors, and others working in STEM have fostered coordinated, networked, public discussions to accelerate the pace of change in their communities [9][10].", "publication_ref": ["b0", "b1", "b2", "b3", "b4", "b5", "b6", "b7", "b8"], "figure_ref": [], "table_ref": []}, {"heading": "#XinSTEM is a Catalyst for Change", "text": "The use of social media as a tool to catalyze social and institutional change is relatively recent. In her 2018 seminal study, Beronda L. Montgomery wrote that the impacts of #XinSTEM social media start-ups \"can range from community building, to proactive mentoring and advocacy, as well as more customary uses for supporting scholarly success of diverse individuals, including dissemination and accessible discussions of research findings [9].\" #XinSTEM movements, in particular, have been recognized as creating powerful online communities via social media that can potentially catalyze lasting change in STEM fields.\nAt our 2030STEM Salon, #XinSTEM founders described the motivations, goals, and impacts of their movements. Many of these campaigns and collaborations have since moved beyond social media, transforming into organizations that plan and hold in-person networking events and professional development workshops. The following is a snapshot of some prominent #XinSTEM initiatives and their activities and approaches. NOTE: This is not an exhaustive list of #XinSTEM movements or collaborators. #BlackinX. Dr. Carlotta Berry, professor and Lawrence J. Giacoletto Chair of Electrical and Computer Engineering at Rose-Hulman Institute of Technology, is the co-founder of #BlackInRobotics and #BlackInEngineering. In 2020, she worked with several members of the #BlackInX community, including Samantha Mensah of #BlackInChem and Quincy Brown of #BlackInComputing. Together, they organized a network of over 80 groups working to advance inclusion and representation to host the inaugural #BlackInX conference, which took place from June 29 to July 3, 2021 [11]. It was considered a sort of \"homecoming,\" marking the one-year anniversary of the exponential growth of the #BlackInX movement.\nBoth the turnout and engagement were significantly higher than expected. As Berry noted, \"we were almost a little blindsided by the amount of people who wanted to connect with us. It was apparent that members of our community were hungry to connect with like-minded individuals to promote a shared mission.\" #BlackinPhysics. Dr. Eileen Gonzales, a postdoctoral fellow at Cornell, along with Dr. Charles Brown, Dr. Jessica Esquivel, and 9 other early career researchers co-founded #BlackinPhysics to \"celebrate Black Physicists and our contributions to the scientific community and to reveal a more complete the picture of what physics looks like.\" Within a short time, this hashtag amassed >3,000 followers and 1.3 million impressions on Twitter. In the last year the #BlackInPhysics movement has transformed into a non-profit organization Black In Physics lead by Drs. Gonzales, Brown, and Esquivel. During the past three year the organization has held professional and social events for the community during #BlackInPhysics Week and beyond. Some of these include: two Wiki-thons in partnership with the American Physical Society and the American Institute of Physics to update the Wikipedia pages of Black scientists, three job fairs showcasing jobs and internship opportunities in their communications, and a yearly essay series during #BlackInPhysics Week were published in Physics Today [12][13][14].\n#BlackInAstro. Ashley Walker, an astrochemist and planetary scientist from Chicago, founded #BlackinAstro to dispel assumptions about scientists who are women, Black, or both. Emphasizing her African American Vernacular English (AAVE), she has noted that people often assume she's \"less than,\" \"subpar,\" \"angry,\" and \"ghetto.\" #BlackInAstro week has allowed Ashley to highlight astronomers of color, which she is hoping can help combat and dispel discriminatory attitudes in planetary science.\nThrough her leadership and that of others, #BlackinAstro has attracted funding from Merck and the Royal Society of Chemistry, has been supported by Ohio State University and UCLA, and has even attracted the attention and support of celebrities like Michael B. Jordan. #BlackinMicro. Dr. Kishana Taylor, a postdoctoral fellow at Carnegie Mellon University, and Dr. Ariangela Kozik, a postdoctoral fellow at the University of Michigan, co-founded #BlackinMicro amidst a global pandemic with a disproportionate impact on communities of color. In 2020, the #BlackinMicro Week virtual conference drew 2,500 participants. By 2021, their conference attendees represented 76 different countries. They have over 9,000 Twitter followers, and posts during #BlackInMicro Week gained 1.1 million impressions.\nHaving highlighted a critical gap in the microbial sciences, #BlackInMicro has transitioned to a non-profit organization, the Black Microbiologists Association (BMA), to continue its work. BMA was founded by Drs. Taylor and Kozik, along with #BlackInMicro Week organizers Dr. Nikea Pittman, a postdoctoral fellow at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill; Dr. Chelsey Spriggs, a postdoctoral fellow at the University of Michigan; and Dr. Ninecia Scott, a postdoctoral fellow at the University of Alabama at Birmingham [15]. BMA currently consists of over 300 members and is working to secure long-term funding for programs and initiatives to further support Black microbiologists across career stages. #BlackInNeuro. Angeline Dukes, a graduate student researcher/addiction neuroscientist from Warner Robins, Georgia, created #BlackinNeuro in response to growing up seeing only white men as scientists. #BlackInNeuro Week was an effort to highlight neuroscientists of color and create awareness in the field [16]. Since then, the movement has grown into a non-profit organization, hosting over 56 events and building a directory of 300+ Black neuroscientist profiles.\nAs a first-generation American and college student whose parents immigrated from Trinidad and Haiti, Dukes didn't get much guidance when it came to applying to schools, seeking scholarships, and choosing careers. She wants to make sure other Black students get the mentorship they need when it comes to choosing a career in science and pursuing their studies. Today, this vision connects scientists around the world, as #BlackInNeuro has amassed over 26,500 followers on Twitter.\n#BlackinNHM. Adania Fleming, a naturalist at the Florida Museum of Natural History at the University of Florida, founded #BlackinNHM in February of 2021 because \"Blacks need to build their own museum space.\" The narrow white culture of museums fails to represent her own cultural and international background.\nThe first #BlackinNHM week was held not only for Black naturalists, but also for Black museumgoers. The vision and aim of #BlackinNHM is a larger cultural change for all participants in natural history.\n#LatinXinMarineSciences. A group of early-stage Ph.D. Students: Alonso Delgado (Ohio State University), Ivan Moreno (UC San Diego), Arani Cuevas (Texas A&M) and Alejandro De Santiago (University of Georgia) founded #LatinXinMarineSciences in the spring of 2020.\nMarine science remains one of the least diverse fields of research, and the non-white students navigating it need support from a community of peers and teachers they can identify with. The goal of this organization was to find other Latin-American and Caribbean marine scientists and create a virtual community that fostered support, shared resources, and helped to actively diversify marine science. #LatinXinBME. Dr. Brian Aguado (UC San Diego) and Dr. Ana Maria Porras (University of Florida) co-founded #LatinX in Biomedical Engineering in February 2019, to leverage community as a means to increase representation of Latinos and promote diversity and inclusion in the Biomedical Engineering workforce. The platform leverages digital tools including Slack and Twitter and organizes webinars and virtual discussions to provide community mentoring and resources for Biomedical Engineers in academia. Since its inception, the #LatinXinBME community has provided mentoring to undergraduate students during academic admissions cycles, graduate students during fellowship and award applications, postdocs navigating the academic job market, and early career faculty members [10].", "publication_ref": ["b7", "b9", "b10", "b11", "b12", "b8"], "figure_ref": [], "table_ref": []}, {"heading": "#NativesInSTEM", "text": "The #NativesInSTEM hashtag was first used in 2013 by Twitter user @native_engineer, a professional engineer who prefers to keep their identity anonymous; they were looking to foster an intersection of science and Native Peoples. Today, #NativeInSTEM is commonly used by a variety of Indigenous students, scientists and science organizations across institutions, countries and disciplines, as a means to find a digital community. Often, Indigenous students are the only Indigenous person in a department or field, as Indigenous students are less than 1% of undergraduate college demographics, and 0.6 percent of doctoral degree holders (2020) [17]. The #NativeinSTEM hashtag has empowered scholars to create community that spans into real life friendships for scholars that might otherwise feel invisible, and whom statistics often leave out because Indigenous populations are such a small part of the educational demographics [18]. These digital communities have also resulted into real life relationships and collaborations, such as the 2022 #WaterBack paper being written by a coalition of Indigenous scholars who first met through Twitter. An important note with the #NativeinSTEM movement, is that with over 572 federally recognized tribes, some Indigenous scholars will also use their specific tribal affiliation in place of the general #NativeinSTEM or #Indigenousscientist hashtags.\nThere has been tremendous energy and growth in #XinSTEM groups in a short time. We discussed how the dynamism of the movement can be expanded and leveraged to effect change, and how lessons learned can be translated to other components of the STEM ecosystem such as professional societies and funding institutions.", "publication_ref": ["b13", "b14"], "figure_ref": [], "table_ref": []}, {"heading": "LEVERAGING #XINSTEM TO BROADEN SOCIAL MEDIA STRATEGIES OF PROFESSIONAL SOCIETIES AND SCIENCE FUNDERS", "text": "Major scientific professional societies are actively looking for ways to engage with #XinSTEM social media movements.

The goal of the directory is to highlight women scientists and innovators and inspire all marginalized and nonconforming genders in order to promote gender equality.\nToday, 1400 Degrees is seeking partnerships with various #XinSTEM groups to invite researchers into their database so their stories can be spotlighted on their platform.

BWF interventions to promote diversity in STEM include the BWF Postdoctoral Diversity Enrichment Program (PDEP), which made its first awards in 2013 and has continued on an annual basis since then. PDEP award recipients have become STEM leaders thanks to near-peer mentoring activities. One example is Promoting Engagement in Science for Underrepresented Ethnic and Racial Minorities (P.E.E.R). This partnership between Vanderbilt University, the University of Iowa, and Winston Salem State University was designed to establish inclusive, long-term, near-peer virtual mentoring within K-12 public schools.\nBurroughs has also created a graduate diversity enrichment network (GDEN) consisting of both prior and current grantees. The network serves as a community of individuals who have not only received and benefited from diversity-based awards but who seek to \"pay it forward\" through their own engagement in diverse STEM activities.

However, just $123.9 million (5.8% of the total grants) went toward diversity, equity and inclusion programs (Figure 2) [19]. Surprisingly, the majority (44%) of the $2B investments were apportioned to a small group of 10 wellendowed, elite institutions, with nominal programs geared towards rectifying systemic barriers in STEM [20]. Such investment patterns only serve to uphold the current inequities within STEM and support small cohorts of students at elite organizations, rather than fostering systemic change.

Many #XinSTEM groups rely on teams of volunteers to manage their workload. Becoming an independent entity, such as an LLC, can provide access to the funds needed to hire dedicated staff.\nHowever, becoming an LLC brings on added responsibilities that may burden many early-career researchers.
